J	Twine, Richard								Is Biotechnology Deconstructing Animal Domestication? Movements toward Liberation								CONFIGURATIONS				21	2	SI		135	158					SPR 2013	2013	It might be assumed that the application of genomics to the production of farmed animals represents a move of acceleration, a broadening and an elaboration of what might be possible in terms of the instrumental shaping of animal bodies to the demands of capital. However, this would be to yield too much to hubristic assumptions about the human control of science and technological innovation, and to discount alternative deployments and provocations of the molecular imaginary. Accordingly, this essay explores the potential of molecular biology to contest an already troubled distinction between wild and domesticated. Within this capability to further undermine the distinction resides a potentially important contribution to the formation of a molecular animal-liberatory imaginary. Although the technique of de-domestication has been discussed in relation to conservation projects, the essay assesses whether it could have a role in the liberation of farmed animals. Adopting a critical perspective toward the imaginary, toward de-domestication, and, indeed, toward assumptions around the meanings of liberation, the essay foregrounds various intersecting notions of temporality as vital both to the explication of biotechnological ambivalence and to the complexities of movements toward animal liberation.									0	0	0	0	0	1063-1801		WOS:000327805900002		
J	Stephens, Neil; Atkinson, Paul; Glasner, Peter								Institutional Imaginaries of Publics in Stem Cell Banking: The Cases of the UK and Spain								SCIENCE AS CULTURE				22	4	SI		497	515		10.1080/14636778.2013.764071			DEC 1 2013	2013	The UK and Spanish Stem Cell Banks hold politically controversialbut potentially therapeutically beneficialhuman embryonic stem cells for distribution to research laboratories globally. The UK bank was the first of its type in the world, opening in 2004, and the Spanish bank used it as a role model in its own development. Both banks structure their operations in response to how their staffs imagine the publics in their nation make trust judgements about their work. Differences between the workings of each bank can be traced to differences in the collective imaginings operating at each banktermed institutional imaginaries'about how publics think. The UK bank sustains an imaginary in which distance lends legitimacy and disengagement signifies correct moral practice. It conjures a public that values a steady, safe and reliable institutionfree from potential conflict of interestabout which the less news the better. This stands in contrast to the Spanish bank that conjures a public that retains an interest in legitimate, ethical guardianship of stem cell material, but which is less worried about conflict of interest in attaining this. Instead, for the Spanish institution, engagement with science and the media through the projection of the bank as cutting edge is deemed crucial for maintaining public support.									0	0	0	0	0	0950-5431		WOS:000327369700006		
J	Welsh, Ian; Wynne, Brian								Science, Scientism and Imaginaries of Publics in the UK: Passive Objects, Incipient Threats								SCIENCE AS CULTURE				22	4	SI		540	566		10.1080/14636778.2013.764072			DEC 1 2013	2013	Two-way public engagement with science is an important modern democratic practice that paradoxically coincides with the intensifications of state surveillance and policing of publics and social movements engaging with issues involving science. This raises important questions about the contemporary anatomies of publics, and what count as legitimate expressions of public concern over scientific stakes within the knowledge economy. Implicit in the tension between inclusion and surveillance are concerns over the social meaning and authority of science amongst both scientific practitioners and publics. Bringing science and technology studies (STS) and social movement studies (SMS) into dialogue offers a means to explore the neglected ontological stakes in the framing of scientific imaginaries of publics, and public imaginaries of science. Post-WWII UK science-publics relations have emerged in three significant modalities, with publics imagined: as passive non-entities, circa 1950-1990 (continuing); as incipient threats due to presumed deficits in their grasp of science 1990-2000 (continuing); and, since circa 2000, as politicised threats requiring state control. Each modality is shaped by elite denial of the normative commitments embedded within science as surrogate politicsscientism. In each mode, scientistic elite emphasis on epistemic issues forecloses engagement with broader public meanings expressing legitimate normative and ontological differences. Fusing the more epistemic focus of STS with SMS's emphasis on meaning and democratic process offers a route to deeper democratic forms of public engagement with what is called science, which would also precipitate more accountability in elite discourses around science and technology.									1	0	0	0	1	0950-5431		WOS:000327369700008		
J	Taylor-Alexander, Samuel								Bioethics in the Making: "Ideal Patients" and the Beginnings of Face Transplant Surgery in Mexico								SCIENCE AS CULTURE				23	1			27	50		10.1080/09505431.2013.789843			JAN 2 2014	2014	Medical teams around the world are increasingly gaining ethical clearance to utilise face transplant surgery as a reconstructive surgical procedure. Analysis of the beginnings of the operation in Mexico vis-a-vis the early uptake of the procedure in France reveals that this controversial experimental medical field has become loaded with national significance. The primary issue of dispute has been the dependence on life-threatening immunosuppressant therapy in a procedure that treats otherwise biologically healthy people. Attempts to resolve related debate has resulted in the emergence of what my interlocutors refer to as an ideal patient, a person whose particular state of health and suffering render them operable within the current biomedical constraints. Drawing together the idiom of coproduction with the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries shows how this imagined patient category was refracted and stabilised as it entered into the Mexican context whilst producing patients and surgical experts as particular types of bioethical subjects. The flexibility and normative value of the ideal patient mobilises and is mobilised by surgeons, who themselves emerge as national bioethical subjects responsible for saving the face of nations in the midst of broader changes surrounding how State's should respond to medical advancement.									0	0	0	0	0	0950-5431		WOS:000329776700002		
J	Olarte Sierra, Maria Fernanda; Del Castillo Hernandez, Adriana Diaz								We Are All the Same, We All Are Mestizos': Imagined Populations and Nations in Genetics Research in Colombia								SCIENCE AS CULTURE				23	2			226	252		10.1080/09505431.2013.838214			APR 3 2014	2014	In Colombia, as in other Latin American countries, current population genetics research is based on the understanding that Colombians constitute a mestizo nation, given the admixture process that took place between Africans, Amerindians, and Europeans during colonial times. The mestizo is a pervasive category used by geneticists to conduct, organise, and publish research studies that deal with the continent's peopling process and the genetic makeup of its contemporary population(s). It is also the dominant imaginary for the Colombian population and a key nation-building ideology. By tracing how this category moves and is used across four Colombian genetics laboratories, it is possible to discern that despite its apparently clear-cut boundaries, the mestizo is contingent, contested, and flexible, allowing for multiple understandings and usages. This flexibility and multiplicity are visible in the quantification of genetic ancestry, the divisions of geographical location, and the understanding of gender. Such understandings allow one to think about a homogeneous nation (inclusive) that is simultaneously heterogeneous (exclusive); they provide multiple but not necessarily contradictory possibilities of being mestizo, allowing the coexistence of images of the nation that could otherwise seem contradictory; and they permit navigation around contested terms such as race, while simultaneously thinking of mixed races or racialised individuals. Finally, these flexible and multiple constructions of the mestizo (re)produce various subjects as other', whether they are women, the Indigenous, the black/dark, or the poor.									1	0	0	0	1	0950-5431		WOS:000335212200004		
J	Kim, Sang-Hyun								The Politics of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research in South Korea: Contesting National Sociotechnical Imaginaries								SCIENCE AS CULTURE				23	3			293	319		10.1080/09505431.2013.860095			SEP 2014	2014	To many commentators outside South Korea, the Hwang Woo Suk scandal involving human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research was just another spectacular case of misconduct in the life sciences. As such, it is generally assumed to have revealed the drawbacks of research in scientifically and ethically less-developed societies. Such thinking ignores the history, sophistication, and distinctive features of the public debate over hESC research in South Korea. Disputes over the social and ethical implications of hESC research had taken place for some time before the scandal erupted. Moreover, unlike in some other countries, where resistance to hESC research was prompted by religious conservatives, the most serious critique of the country's rapid move into the field came from progressive social movement activists-including feminists and environmentalists. These activists were, in fact, part of the non-governmental organization coalition to impose stricter social controls on biotechnology. This campaign was motivated by broader political and social concerns beyond specific biosafety or bioethical issues. The activists involved in the coalition feared that the capitalist-developmentalist drive toward biotechnology would threaten the public interest and democracy, and ultimately block South Korea's road to becoming a democratic nation founded on the values of social justice, equality, participation, and sustainability. In contesting South Korea's prevailing approaches to hESC research, they challenged, albeit unsuccessfully, the dominant 'national sociotechnical imaginary' that articulates the role of science and technology in relation to the future survival and well-being of the nation primarily in terms of its industrial competitiveness.									1	0	0	0	1	0950-5431		WOS:000340996900001		
J	Pollock, Anne								Places of pharmaceutical knowledge-making: Global health, postcolonial science, and hope in South African drug discovery								SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE				44	6			848	873		10.1177/0306312714543285			DEC 2014	2014	This article draws on ethnographic research at iThemba Pharmaceuticals, a small South African startup pharmaceutical company with an elite international scientific board. The word iThemba' is Zulu for hope', and so far drug discovery at the company has been essentially aspirational rather than actual. Yet this particular place provides an entry point for exploring how the location of the scientific knowledge component of pharmaceuticals - rather than their production, licensing, or distribution - matters. The article explores why it matters for those interested in global health and postcolonial science, and why it matters for the scientists themselves. Consideration of this case illuminates limitations of global health frameworks that implicitly posit rich countries as the unique site of knowledge production, and thus as the source of unidirectional knowledge flows. It also provides a concrete example for consideration of the contexts and practices of postcolonial science, its constraints, and its promise. Although the world is not easily bifurcated, it still matters who makes knowledge and where.									0	0	0	0	0	0306-3127		WOS:000345573700003	25608441
