J	Millerand, Florence; Ribes, David; Baker, Karen S.; Bowker, Geoffrey C.								Making an Issue out of a Standard: Storytelling Practices in a Scientific Community								SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES				38	1			7	43		10.1177/0162243912437221			JAN 2013	2013	The article focuses on stories and storytelling practices as explanatory resources in standardization processes. It draws upon an ethnographic study of the development of a technical standard for data sharing in an ecological research community, where participants struggle to articulate the difficulties encountered in implementing the standard. Building from C. Wright Mills' classic distinction between private troubles and public issues, the authors follow the development of a story as it comes to assist in transforming individual troubles in standard implementation into an institutional issue for the ecological scientific community. The authors present the "hands-on" social science collaboration in this study as an example of a mechanism for supporting institutionalization of issues. Finally, the authors argue that narratives can serve as effective organizing principles within institutional settings, thereby providing an approach to understand the practical, substantive difficulties that occur in work with data in the sciences.									2	0	0	0	2	0162-2439		WOS:000313988900001		
J	Niezen, Maartje G. H.; Bal, Roland; de Bont, Antoinette								Reconfiguring Policy and Clinical Practice: How Databases Have Transformed the Regulation of Pharmaceutical Care?								SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES				38	1			44	66		10.1177/0162243911435277			JAN 2013	2013	This article's aim is to understand if and how the efforts to accumulate and organize clinical data transformed the regulation of pharmaceutical care. The authors analyze how the employment of databases by collectives of physicians and researchers shape both clinical and policy practice-and thereby reshape the relation between clinical work and policy. Since the late 1990s, Dutch government has supported the development of clinical databases for specific expensive medicines to gain oversight about actual medicine use. To be able to produce evidence for appropriate medicine use, the collectives set regulations in clinical practice. These internal regulations provide a framework for establishing "appropriate medicine use", steering reimbursement decisions. However, internal regulation and policy rules differ in how quickly they can change. While the employment of databases in clinical practices results in a constant adjustment of the protocols, policy makers require the databases to provide for static moments of "proven appropriate medicine use" in order to account for and define a fixed and closed formulary. Subsequently, the employment of the databases did not deliver on the promise of oversight and control due to different clinical and policy requirements. Nevertheless, the databases did stimulate appropriate medicine use and reimbursement in clinical practice.									0	0	0	0	0	0162-2439		WOS:000313988900002		
J	Grundmann, Reiner								"Climategate" and The Scientific Ethos								SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES				38	1			67	93		10.1177/0162243911432318			JAN 2013	2013	In late 2009, e-mails from a server at the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia were released that showed some climate scientists in an unfavorable light. Soon this scandal was known as "Climategate" and a highly charged debate started to rage on blogs and in the mass media. Much of the debate has been about the question whether anthropogenic global warming was undermined by the revelations. But ethical issues, too, became part and parcel of the debate. This article aims to contribute to this debate, assessing the e-mail affair in the light of two normative analyses of science, one proposed by Robert Merton (and developed further by some of his followers), the second by a recent suggestion to use the concept of honest brokering in science policy interactions. On the basis of these analyses, different aspects of malpractice will be discussed and possible solutions will be suggested.									6	0	0	0	6	0162-2439		WOS:000313988900003		
J	Levidow, Les; Birch, Kean; Papaioannou, Theo								Divergent Paradigms of European Agro-Food Innovation: The Knowledge-Based Bio-Economy (KBBE) as an R&D Agenda								SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES				38	1			94	125		10.1177/0162243912438143			JAN 2013	2013	The Knowledge-Based Bio-Economy (KBBE) has gained prominence as an agricultural R&D agenda of the European Union. Specific research policies are justified as necessary to create a KBBE for societal progress. Playing the role of a master narrative, the KBBE attracts rival visions; each favours a different diagnosis of unsustainable agriculture and its remedies in agro-food innovation. Each vision links a technoscientific paradigm with a quality paradigm: the dominant life sciences vision combines converging technologies with decomposability, while a marginal one combines agro-ecology with integral product integrity. From these divergent visions, rival stakeholder networks contend for influence over research policies and priorities, especially within the Framework Programme 7 (FP7) on Food, Agriculture, Fisheries and Biotechnology (FAFB), which has aimed to promote a Knowledge-Based Bio-Economy. Although the FAFB programme has favoured a life sciences vision, agro-ecological approaches have gained a presence, thus overcoming their general lock-out from agricultural research agendas. In their own way, each rival paradigm emphasises the need for collective systems to gather information for linking producers with users, as a rationale for the public sector to fund distinctive research priorities.									5	0	3	0	5	0162-2439		WOS:000313988900004		
J	Johnson, David R.								"Technological Change and Professional Control in the Professoriate"								SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES				38	1			126	149		10.1177/0162243911430236			JAN 2013	2013	Scholarship on technological change in academe suggests that the adoption of instructional technologies will erode professional control. Researchers have documented the pervasiveness of new technologies, but neither demonstrate how technological change is experienced by faculty nor collect data that permit assessment of consequences for professional control. Drawing on a sample of interviews with forty-two professors at three research-intensive universities, this research makes two contributions to existing research. First, in contrast to existing depictions of technological change in higher education, the findings reveals that academics perceive instructional technologies to have limited value in enhancing education and that technology use is rarely motivated by pedagogical innovation. Second, the study suggests that a relationship between technological change and "unbundling" of the academic role may be overstated. These data indicate that technological change threatens professional autonomy through exclusion from decision-making processes, increased workloads, and delimited teaching and research roles.									2	0	0	0	2	0162-2439		WOS:000313988900005

J	Nelson, Nicole C.								Modeling mouse, human, and discipline: Epistemic scaffolds in animal behavior genetics								SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE				43	1			3	29		10.1177/0306312712463815			FEB 2013	2013	Animal models of human disorders are a ubiquitous feature of contemporary biomedical research, but how is their value and role in understanding human disorders established? This article examines the dynamics of building up (and sometimes knocking down) claims about what a model can demonstrate in the field of animal behavior genetics. Drawing on long-standing analogies that describe scientific knowledge production as a process of construction, I introduce the metaphor of an 'epistemic scaffold' to illuminate how scientists create and contest claims about the utility of animal models. The flexible, temporary nature of scaffolding draws attention to the processes of building up claims to increasingly risky heights and reconfiguring the evidence supporting particular models by including or excluding particular facts and claims. As researchers include or exclude observations from epistemic scaffolds, to contest or build up different links, they gradually frame human disorders. Negotiations over how much to claim about the utility of animal models also reflect larger tensions in the discipline concerning what animal studies reveal about human disorders.									3	0	0	0	3	0306-3127		WOS:000313595400001		
J	Pickersgill, Martyn								How personality became treatable: The mutual constitution of clinical knowledge and mental health law								SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE				43	1			30	53		10.1177/0306312712457722			FEB 2013	2013	In recent years, personality disorders - psychiatric constructs understood as enduring dysfunctions of personality - have come into ever-greater focus for British policymakers, mental health professionals and service-users. Disputes have focussed largely on highly controversial attempts by the UK Department of Health to introduce mental health law and policy (now enshrined within the 2007 Mental Health Act of England and Wales). At the same time, clinical framings of personality disorder have dramatically shifted: once regarded as untreatable conditions, severe personality disorders are today thought of by many clinicians to be responsive to psychiatric and psychological intervention. In this article, I chart this transformation by means of a diachronic analysis of debates and institutional shifts pertaining to both attempts to change the law, and understandings of personality disorder. In so doing, I show how mental health policy and practice have mutually constituted one another, such that the aims of clinicians and policymakers have come to be closely aligned. I argue that it is precisely through these reciprocally constitutive processes that the profound reconfiguration of personality disorder from being an obdurate to a plastic condition has occurred; this demonstrates the significance of interactions between law and the health professions in shaping not only the State's management of pathology, but also perceptions of its very nature.									3	0	0	0	3	0306-3127		WOS:000313595400002		
J	Schleifer, David								Categories count: Trans fat labeling as a technique of corporate governance								SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE				43	1			54	77		10.1177/0306312712461573			FEB 2013	2013	This article explains how regulators use categorization, quantification, and labeling to change how corporations manufacture commercial products. The Food and Drug Administration wanted to create an incentive for manufacturers to replace trans fats by requiring food labels to disclose trans fat content. The Food and Drug Administration initially proposed categorizing trans fats as saturated fats and quantifying both substances with one number on labels, but industry actors largely favored quantifying trans fats separately from saturated fats. Industry actors argued that such an approach would show consumers which products had been reformulated to contain 0 g of trans fats, thus allowing manufacturers to market reformulated products as 'healthier' and rewarding investments in alternative technologies. The Food and Drug Administration ultimately decided to categorize and quantify the two fats separately, specifically designing the disclosure of quantitative information in order to encourage technological change. Thus, I argue that quantifying information on commercial product labels was not only intended to govern individual consumption but was also intended to govern production in anticipation of individuals governing their consumption. Regulators used their capacity to quantify as a means to govern industrial production.									1	0	0	0	1	0306-3127		WOS:000313595400003		
J	Kuchinskaya, Olga								Twice invisible: Formal representations of radiation danger								SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE				43	1			78	96		10.1177/0306312712465356			FEB 2013	2013	This article examines the politics of formal representations of environmental hazards. Certain environmental hazards are made publicly invisible when their formal representations are misaligned with what can be measured in practice under the existing socioeconomic and technoscientific conditions. Conversely, better aligning formal representations and measurement capabilities helps reveal the scope of such hazards. Such (mis)alignment of formal representations is a relative, dialogical, and historically specific process. It requires not only experts and their specialized knowledge, but also contextual knowledge of the actual local conditions. The work of alignment of formal representations requires public 'un-black-boxing' of these formalisms. It also depends on much infrastructural work, which I describe as the invisible work of making visible. (Mis)alignment of formal representations is illustrated here with the examples of three successive concepts of radiation protection in Belarus, a former Soviet Union republic that was covered with much of the Chernobyl fallout. Revisions to the radiation protection concept first expanded and then dramatically shrank the scope of the officially recognized and publicly visible radioactive contamination in Belarus.									3	0	0	0	3	0306-3127		WOS:000313595400004		
J	Laursen, Ditte								Co-participation among school children around a computer-based exhibit								SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE				43	1			97	117		10.1177/0306312712455114			FEB 2013	2013	This paper investigates the different forms of social interaction that emerge between young science centre visitors (aged 9-14 years) around a specific computer-based exhibit, which, like most computer-based exhibits, prioritizes an individual user. Based on video recordings, the paper shows that these young visitors, unlike adults, engage in various forms of co-participation around the exhibit. The empirical analysis compares different degrees of participation among the participants, ranging from minimal to full participation. The analysis shows that the affordances of a computer-based exhibit do not impose themselves upon visitors' actions at that exhibit. While the exhibit has a preferred use - a 'prescribed interaction', which prioritizes an individual user - the schoolchildren in the study mould what may seem like natural functions of the exhibit.									0	0	0	0	0	0306-3127		WOS:000313595400005

The good, the bad and the perfect: Criticizing engagement practice								SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE				43	1			118	135		10.1177/0306312712462461			FEB 2013	2013	Criticism seems to be a recurring and significant characteristic of public engagement exercises - as reflected both in general political discussion and in the academic literature on public engagement with science. This article suggests that rather than being a distraction from the main business of 'technical democracy', criticism lies at the heart of public engagement and in that way should be seen not simply as an unwelcome and unanticipated by-product but rather as a key constituent. Taking inspiration from previous science and technology studies' treatments of 'bottom line' moves and also from Boltanski and Thevenot's sociology of critical capacity, this article adopts an approach to radical critique that explores its 'dynamic-yet-patterned' character. Building upon a 'translation' model, but also a framework taken from the martial arts, a reconstruction is offered of one empirical study of lay membership on scientific advisory committees. Conclusions are drawn concerning not only the analysis of critical dialogue around engagement but also the implications for democratic practice.									5	0	0	0	5	0306-3127		WOS:000313595400006

By focussing on subtle masculinist actions that women find disadvantageous to them, we seek to extend knowledge about women's under-representation in senior positions in healthcare science - despite women being in the majority at junior levels. We maintain that healthcare science continues to be dominated by taken-for-granted masculinities that marginalize women, keeping them in their 'place'. Our aim is to make visible the subtle practices that are normally invisible by showing masculinities in action. Principally using feminist analyses, our findings show that both women and men are often unaware of taken-for-granted masculinist actions, and even when women do notice, they rarely challenge the subtle sexist behaviour.									2	0	0	0	2	0306-3127		WOS:000313595400007

Including entomological expertise, insect knowledge has been integral to the expansion of empire, the emergence of secular science, and in the managerial revolution that linked technology to agricultural improvement. Reading insects as hosts, vectors and companions of science, this special issue Introduction opens up the epistemic, biopolitical and social dimensions of humaninsect connections. Drawing insight from studies into the material culture of science, postcolonial geographies and a burgeoning literature on humananimal relations, we invite readers to consider how practices and products of science are made up of encounters between scientists and insects. By parsing these intersections, we can begin to understand the kinds of knowledge made possible and elusive by insects' capacity to connect and carry, inscribe and destabilize, disgust and inspire. Insects are good to think with because of the analogies that can be drawn to human life and social order. Moreover, thinking with insects is foremost a task of theoretical innovation, one that has allowed us to re-examine how life produces space, time and history, and to intensify entanglements of ecological, institutional and experimental relations.									3	0	0	0	3	0950-5431		WOS:000317299200001		
J	Clark, Nigel								Mobile Life: Biosecurity Practices and Insect Globalization								SCIENCE AS CULTURE				22	1	SI		16	37		10.1080/09505431.2013.776366			MAR 1 2013	2013	Recent decades have seen a series of high-profile public health crises involving viruses, bacteria and other biological agents, together with escalating concern over impacts of biological invasion on crops and ecosystems. In the context of intensifying globalization, such hazards are being viewed as serious security' threats. For critical social theorists, this growing concern with biosecurity at the global scale has worrying implications, in that it promotes a state of fear over life itself' which is being used to justify heightened surveillance and increasingly intrusive intervention. However, there are alternative perspectives on living with adventitious and unpredictable biological life. For over a century and a half, settler societies' such as Aotearoa New Zealand and Australia have been grappling with the environmental and economic impacts of non-native organisms running wild. Examining events surrounding an incursion of tussock moths in Auckland, it is argued that biosecurity policy can also be viewed as a flexible and evolving response to uncertainties associated with translocated biological life. Furthermore, the peripheral' tradition of sustained inquiry around the issue of which organisms belong in which places leads us back to questions about the characteristics of insects themselves and about the dynamics of the environments with which they interact. In this way, critical thinking around biosecurity is opened to a depth of engagement with evolutionary and geological processes that offer new dimensions to thinking about the biopolitics' and geopolitics' of encountering life out of bounds.									3	0	0	0	3	0950-5431		WOS:000317299200002

Nevertheless, the recent releases of the first genetically modified (GM) mosquitoes into the wild have triggered heated discussions. How is the humanmosquito relationship being reconfigured through the development of GM mosquitoes? The scientific modifications that make mosquitoes incapable of transmitting malaria and capable of generating profit have epistemic consequences for public health. GM mosquitoes have shifted malaria control in ways that might best be understood in terms of transposition' (Braidotti): the mosquito transforms from a disease-bringing agent to a benevolent public health tool. This transformation from vector to tool is technically elegant, but this elegance is also risky. As the history of malaria epidemics has shown, mosquitoes travel long distances in hardly predictable patterns. Creating a GM mosquito then also means to surrender public health practices to the lines of flight of the mosquito itself.									3	0	0	0	3	0950-5431		WOS:000317299200003		
J	Bertoni, Filippo								Soil and Worm: On Eating as Relating								SCIENCE AS CULTURE				22	1	SI		61	85		10.1080/09505431.2013.776365			MAR 1 2013	2013	Earthworms and soil combine in an ecotoxicological experiment in the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. To determine the effects of a toxic compound produced by genetically modified broccoli, ecotoxicologists use the earthworm in a standardized test to understand the conditions of the soil. In the experiment a variety of elements are brought together and associated in a stable network, but the worm and the soil do not only associate; rather, the worm emerges entangled in different kinds of relations with the soil, both as bioindicator and as bioturbator. Eating provides a good tool to analyze these relations: keeping close to the tangible materialities of the lab practices, eating highlights the complex, asymmetrical relationality of worm and soil. This pushes the understanding of association that circulates in social theory, bringing back its original critical stance towards given notions of liberal, autonomous agents with renewed empirical strength. Thus eating not only frames worms that emerge from the practices of ecotoxicologists as bioindicators and as bioturbators, but it also offers a different language for what has been called the politics of nature', or how to bring nature into politics without accepting it as a given. In responding to the question on how to live with our planet, eating reminds us that we would do well to start from practices instead of agency in framing our politics of nature'.									0	0	0	0	0	0950-5431		WOS:000317299200004		
J	Kelly, Ann H.; Lezaun, Javier								Walking or Waiting? Topologies of the Breeding Ground in Malaria Control								SCIENCE AS CULTURE				22	1	SI		86	107		10.1080/09505431.2013.776368			MAR 1 2013	2013	Few places bear as much historical and scientific significance as the breeding ground, the accumulation of stagnant water where disease-carrying insects lay their eggs. Since the turn of the twentieth century, when mosquitoes of the Anopheles genus were identified as the vector of malaria transmission, these aquatic habitats have been a key object of epidemiological research and public health intervention against the disease. Yet the breeding ground can be incorporated into a number of different topologies, each implying a different spatialization of malaria and a distinct imagination of what kind of mosquito control is doable'. A contemporary example of malaria control in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, illuminates an essential tension between what we characterize as territorial and bionomic approaches to the breeding groundthat is, between control strategies premised on treating all mosquito habitats within a given region, and those that prioritize certain sites on the basis of their position within ecological networks. Each topology localizes the breeding ground by reference to a distinct set of relations, and thus advances an idiosyncratic understanding of what sort of research is worthwhile conducting and what kinds of intervention are sustainable. The multiple ways in which the breeding ground can become an object of research and action clarifies the role of topology as an infra-logic of public health, and makes explicit the politics implicit in efforts to bring different orders of the local to scale.									2	0	0	0	2	0950-5431		WOS:000317299200005

But cumulative collaborative scientific workwhat scientists actually do together; the ways in which they act on the world and transform our understanding of itcan also help create durable enabling environments for ongoing scientific practice. Project Locustox began in 1989 as a pilot to evaluate the environmental effect of locust control pesticides in the Sahel. It was prolonged through additional project phases over the next decade; in 1999, a locally-administered permanent ecotoxicological research centre was established in Senegal. Central to this project was the creation of Sahelian bio-indicators. The work of indicating, which was largely performed with and by insects, can be described as enacting infrastructure. Insects formed an axis along which data and expertise were accumulated, and, as a result, they were stabilized as durable toolsas bodies, colonies and the techniques for manipulating themfor future Sahelian ecotoxicology. Considering insects as producing infrastructure invites a reflection on the possibilities and difficulties of scientific capacity-building in the Global South. Specifically, examining the temporal extensions of indicating work leads to an account of how sustained investment in continuous collaborative scientific work can draw together biological entities, techniques, knowledge, materials, working relations and institutions to build durable capacity for science; but insect indicators also reveal the costs of and obstacles to maintaining the integration of methodological, material and institutional components of infrastructure.									2	0	0	0	2	0950-5431		WOS:000317299200006

Increasingly, both practicing scientists and engineers and scholars of science and technology cite justice as an organizing theme of their work. In this essay, I consider why "science and justice" might be arising now. I then ask after the opportunities, but also the dangers, of this formation. By way of example, I explore the openings and exclusions created by the recent conjugation of science and justice in the field of personal genomics. Finally, I conclude with reflections on what other forms "science and justice" might take, and what might be gained or lost in fostering them.									5	0	1	0	5	0162-2439		WOS:000330312100002

The lawsuit reached a settlement in April 2010 that included monetary compensation and return of DNA samples to the Havasupai but left no legal precedent for researchers. Through semistructured interviews, institutional review board (IRB) chairs and human genetics researchers at US research institutions revealed their perspectives on the Havasupai lawsuit. For interviewees, the suit drew attention to indigenous concerns over genetic studies and increased their awareness of indigenous views. However, interviewees perceived no direct impact from the Havasupai case on their work; if they did, it was the perceived need to safeguard themselves by obtaining broad consent or shying away from research with indigenous communities altogether, raising important questions of justice for indigenous and minority participants. If researchers and IRBs do not change their practices in light of this case, these populations will likely continue to be excluded from a majority of research studies and left with less access to resources and potential benefit from genetic research participation.									1	0	0	0	1	0162-2439		WOS:000330312100003

Justice as Measure of Nongovernmental Organization Success in Postdisaster Community Assistance								SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES				38	2	SI		224	249		10.1177/0162243912470726			MAR 2013	2013	Through exploring multiple contemporary conceptions of justice, this article illustrates that justice matters when considering outcomes in non-governmental organization (NGO) assistance. In environmental justice (EJ) scholarship, the term justice has been underproblematized, assuming a tacit understanding of the concept as fairness or equitable distribution of environmental harms. Using the rebuilding of two heavily damaged poor and minority neighborhoods in post-Katrina New Orleans as case studies, this article makes evident the different conceptualizations of justice embedded within the strategies and techniques of NGOs and community organizations. Examining both practices and outcomes, I argue that the definition of justice that NGOs implicitly or explicitly adopt in their strategies and technologies of assistance can lead to very different results in postdisaster neighborhood revitalization. For science and technology studies, conceptions of justice can help articulate a more critical social science that opens up the descriptive/normative divide. This is important in thinking about equitable social change and allied policy-as it applies not only to NGO assistance but also to other science and technology issues that intersect with marginalized communities as well.									1	0	0	0	1	0162-2439		WOS:000330312100004

Procedural justice, moreover, requires that affected people have a substantial understanding of the hazards that a particular decision would impose. While EJ scholars and activists point out a number of obstacles to ensuring substantial understanding-including industry's nondisclosure of relevant information and technocratic problem framings-this article shows how key insights from Science and Technology Studies (STS) about the nature of knowledge pose even more fundamental challenges for procedural justice. In particular, the knowledge necessary to inform participation in decision making is likely not to exist at the time of decision making, undermining the potential for people to give their informed consent to being exposed to an environmental hazard. In addition, much of the local knowledge important to understanding the consequences of hazards will develop only after decisions have been made, and technoscientific knowledge of environmental effects will inevitably change over the period during which people will be affected by a hazard. The changing landscape of knowledge calls into question the idea that consent or participation during one decision-making process can by itself constitute procedural justice. An STS-informed understanding of the nature of knowledge, this article argues, implies that procedural justice should include proactive knowledge production to fill in knowledge gaps, and ongoing opportunities for communities to consent to the presence of hazards as local knowledge emerges and scientific knowledge changes.									2	0	0	0	2	0162-2439		WOS:000330312100005		
J	McGowan, Michelle L.; Sharp, Richard R.								Justice in the Context of Family Balancing								SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES				38	2	SI		271	293		10.1177/0162243912469412			MAR 2013	2013	Bioethics and feminist scholarship has explored various justice implications of nonmedical sex selection and family balancing. However, prospective users' viewpoints have been absent from the debate over the socially acceptable bounds of nonmedical sex selection. This qualitative study provides a set of empirically grounded perspectives on the moral values that underpin prospective users' conceptualizations of justice in the context of a family balancing program in the United States. The results indicate that couples pursuing family balancing understand justice primarily in individualist and familial terms rather than in terms of social justice for women and girls or for children resulting from sex selection. Study participants indicated that an individual's desire for gender balance in their family is ethically complex and may not be inherently sexist, immoral, or socially consequential, particularly given the social context in which they live. Our findings suggest that the social conditions that contribute to prospective users' desires for gender balance in their families may direct them away from recognizing or engaging broader social justice concerns relating to sexism and stratified reproduction.									1	0	1	0	1	0162-2439		WOS:000330312100006

J	Wazeck, Milena								Marginalization processes in science: The controversy about the theory of relativity in the 1920s								SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE				43	2			163	190		10.1177/0306312712469855			APR 2013	2013	In the 1920s, hundreds of pamphlets were published whose authors self-confidently claimed to have refuted the theory of relativity. The opposition to relativity was extraordinarily fierce and lasted years, including not only physicists and philosophers but also scientific laymen. What were the motives of Einstein's opponents? On what basis was the theory of relativity attacked so vociferously? This article focuses on the emergence of a heterogeneous international network of academic and nonacademic opponents to Einstein in the early 1920s and suggests a theoretical approach for understanding the nature of the controversy about the theory of relativity. I argue that the controversy about the theory of relativity represents a type of controversy that is unresolvable because of the ontological commitments underlying the arguments against academic consensus and the social dynamics of a process of marginalization of proponents of deviant knowledge.									1	0	0	0	1	0306-3127		WOS:000329433200002		
J	Lawless, Christopher J.								The low template DNA profiling controversy: Biolegality and boundary work among forensic scientists								SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE				43	2			191	214		10.1177/0306312712465665			APR 2013	2013	This article describes disputes that have arisen around forms of forensic DNA profiling technologies known as low-template DNA' methods. These ultra-sensitive techniques, used to analyse trace quantities of DNA, have previously been used in many high-profile criminal cases. However, certain cases have stimulated renewed debate within forensic scientific communities concerning the reliability and validity of low-template DNA. The low-template DNA controversy is used in this article to further explore the co-productive dynamics between biotechnology and criminal justice, which have previously been termed biolegality'. My study describes the boundary work through which interlocutors have attempted to frame the status of low-template DNA as a forensic innovation. A series of published exchanges by forensic scientists in a technical journal is used to highlight the challenges of negotiating a series of technological boundaries through which low-template DNA has been comprehended by actors. I show how the articulation of low-template DNA creates new and varying epistemic relationships and dependencies. In making visible this boundary work, I highlight the potential for further exploration of the interactional dimensions of biolegality.									0	0	0	0	0	0306-3127		WOS:000329433200003		
J	Suryanarayanan, Sainath; Kleinman, Daniel Lee								Be(e) coming experts: The controversy over insecticides in the honey bee colony collapse disorder								SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE				43	2			215	240		10.1177/0306312712466186			APR 2013	2013	In this article, we explore the politics of expertise in an ongoing controversy in the United States over the role of certain insecticides in colony collapse disorder - a phenomenon involving mass die-offs of honey bees. Numerous long-time commercial beekeepers contend that newer systemic agricultural insecticides are a crucial part of the cocktail of factors responsible for colony collapse disorder. Many scientists actively researching colony collapse disorder reject the beekeepers' claims, citing the lack of conclusive evidence from field experiments by academic and industry toxicologists. US Environmental Protection Agency regulators, in turn, privilege the latters' approach to the issue, and use the lack of conclusive evidence of systemic insecticides' role in colony collapse disorder to justify permitting these chemicals to remain on the market. Drawing on semistructured interviews with key players in the controversy, as well as published documents and ethnographic data, we show how a set of research norms and practices from agricultural entomology came to dominate the investigation of the links between pesticides and honey bee health, and how the epistemological dominance of these norms and practices served to marginalize the knowledge claims and policy positions of commercial beekeepers in the colony collapse disorder controversy. We conclude with a discussion of how the colony collapse disorder case can help us think about the nature and politics of expertise.									4	0	1	0	4	0306-3127		WOS:000329433200004		
J	Le Dantec, Christopher A.; DiSalvo, Carl								Infrastructuring and the formation of publics in participatory design								SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE				43	2			241	264		10.1177/0306312712471581			APR 2013	2013	Of late, there has been a renewed and reinvigorated exchange of ideas across science and technology studies and participatory design, emerging from a shared interest in publics'. In this article, we explore the role of participatory design in constituting publics, drawing together recent scholarship in both science and technology studies and participatory design. To frame our discussion, we present two case studies of community-based participatory design as empirical examples. From these examples and the literature, we discuss the ways in which the concepts of infrastructuring and attachments are central to the constitution of publics. Finally, through an analysis of our case studies, we consider the differences between the practices of enabling participation and infrastructuring, calling attention to the ways that constituting publics foregrounds an engagement with authority structures and unknown futures through the participatory design process.									2	0	0	0	2	0306-3127		WOS:000329433200005		
J	Chong, Phillipa								Legitimate judgment in art, the scientific world reversed? Maintaining critical distance in evaluation								SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE				43	2			265	281		10.1177/0306312712475256			APR 2013	2013	This article considers affinities between artistic and scientific evaluations. Objectivity has been widely studied, as it is thought the foundation for legitimate judgments of truth. Yet we know comparatively little about subjectivity apart from its characterization as the obstacle to objective knowledge. In this article, I examine how subjectivity operates as an epistemic virtue in artistic evaluation, which is an especially interesting field for study given the accepted relativism of taste. Data are taken from interviews with 30 book reviewers drawn from major American newspapers including The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, and others. The data reveal that critics invest in a set of strategies to effectively objectivize' the subjectivity intrinsic to artistic evaluation, which I refer to collectively as strategies for maintaining critical distance. I argue that the concrete procedures for producing legitimate judgment in the world of art can be usefully compared to the norms for legitimate judgment in science.									0	0	0	0	0	0306-3127		WOS:000329433200006

We present a population model that suggests that the reason the average age of grant recipients is now higher is because the growth rate of science has slowed down in the last four decades.									1	0	1	0	1	0306-3127		WOS:000329433200007

J	Birch, Kean; Tyfield, David								Theorizing the Bioeconomy: Biovalue, Biocapital, Bioeconomics or ... What?								SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES				38	3			299	327		10.1177/0162243912442398			MAY 2013	2013	In the policy discourses of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and European Commission (EC), modern biotechnology and the life sciences are represented as an emerging "bioeconomy'' in which the latent value underpinning biological materials and products offers the opportunity for sustainable economic growth. This articulation of modern biotechnology and economic development is an emerging scholarly field producing numerous "bio-concepts.'' Over the last decade or so, there have been a number of attempts to theorize this relationship between biotechnologies and their capitalization. This article highlights some of the underlying ambiguities in these conceptualizations, especially in the fetishization of everything "bio.'' We offer an alternative view of the bioeconomy by rethinking the theoretical importance of several key economic and financial processes.									9	0	4	0	9	0162-2439		WOS:000330314200001		
J	Elliott, Kevin C.								Selective Ignorance and Agricultural Research								SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES				38	3			328	350		10.1177/0162243912442399			MAY 2013	2013	Scholars working in science and technology studies have recently argued that we could learn much about the nature of scientific knowledge by paying closer attention to scientific ignorance. Building on the work of Robert Proctor, this article shows how ignorance can stem from a wide range of selective research choices that incline researchers toward partial, limited understandings of complex phenomena. A recent report produced by the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science, and Technology for Development serves as the article's central case study. After arguing that the forms of selective ignorance illustrated in cases like this one are both socially important and difficult to address, I suggest several strategies for responding to them in a socially responsible manner.									2	0	0	0	2	0162-2439		WOS:000330314200002		
J	Ormerod, Kerri Jean; Scott, Christopher A.								Drinking Wastewater: Public Trust in Potable Reuse								SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES				38	3			351	373		10.1177/0162243912444736			MAY 2013	2013	In the coming decades, highly treated wastewater, known as reclaimed water, is slated to be a major element of municipal water supplies. In particular, planners propose supplementing drinking water with reclaimed water as a sustainable solution to the growing challenge of urban water scarcity. Public opposition is currently considered the primary barrier to implementing successful potable water reuse projects; nonetheless, public responses to reclaimed water are not well understood. Based on a survey of over 250 residents of Tucson, Arizona, this article assesses the relationship between trust in the professional institutions responsible for municipal water development and willingness to drink reclaimed water. Results demonstrate that public acceptance of potable reuse is contingent on trust in the authorities who influence design of sociotechnical systems for water supply and reuse-including water and wastewater utilities, regulators, consultants, academics, and elected local officials. Findings emphasize the highly interdependent social and political factors that inform personal decisions to support or reject potable reuse. The authors suggest that achieving greater acceptance of potable reuse will require bringing local and regional water policy in line with public values, as well as finding ways to incorporate these values into the planning process.									2	0	1	0	2	0162-2439		WOS:000330314200003		
J	Shilton, Katie								Values Levers: Building Ethics into Design								SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES				38	3			374	397		10.1177/0162243912436985			MAY 2013	2013	As information systems transform our world, computer scientists design affordances that influence the uses and impacts of these technological objects. This article describes how the practices of design affect the social values materialized in emerging technologies, and explores how design practices can encourage ethical reflection and action. The article presents an ethnography of a laboratory that engineered software for mobile phones to track users' locations, habits, and behaviors. This technical work raised a number of ethical challenges, particularly around questions of data use and surveillance. The ethnography suggests that particular activities within laboratories can help engineers agree on social values as important to design. It characterizes these activities as values levers: practices that open new conversations about social values and encourage consensus around those values as design criteria. Laboratory leaders and advocates can enable and strengthen these levers to encourage ethical reflection and action as an explicit part of design practice.									2	0	0	0	2	0162-2439		WOS:000330314200004		
J	Holmberg, Christine; Bischof, Christine; Bauer, Susanne								Making Predictions: Computing Populations								SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES				38	3			398	420		10.1177/0162243912439610			MAY 2013	2013	Statistics constitute the social universe of which they are gathered. The foundation necessary to develop quantified knowledge about society is the population. If quantified knowledge changes society, the question arises on how individuals become to be represented as population. The population has to be extracted from individuals in a process that we call "populationisation.'' This encompasses the development of the individual into a segment of a population through the compilation of individual data into population data and its analysis. To describe the process of populationisation, we follow a statistical risk assessment tool, the German Diabetes Risk Score, from its inception in a cohort study to its entry into the public sphere of German society. The population is extracted from individuals that function as research subjects through an identification number. Preprocessed information is entered into a dynamic database that enables its rearrangement according to main aggregates. Through populationisation, a signified is enacted that can be sliced up and that is equal in all its parts. Now predictions can be computed and fed back to society as tools of moral judgment. The acting individual and "society'' are-numerically and literally!-entangled in the production and enactment of risk knowledge.									2	0	0	0	2	0162-2439		WOS:000330314200005		
J	Lin, Wen-yuan								Displacement of Agency: The Enactment of Patients' Agency in and beyond Haemodialysis Practices								SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES				38	3			421	443		10.1177/0162243912443717			MAY 2013	2013	How might the agency of the subaltern be conceptualized within the intersection of multiple worlds? Actor-network theory's (ANT) translation framework for understanding agency portraying this as entrepreneur and talking of a world in the making is arguably "imperialist,'' "managerial,'' and "monolithic.'' Draws from the enactment turn of ANT and insights into the politics of representation, this article elaborates an alternative framework which focuses on displacement. By examining the case of dialysis patients, the article explores the displacing practices that follow the disruption of routines in dialysis. Patients have to go through a process of problematization, distribution, hybridization, and restabilization, in order to sustain the coexistence of their alternative practices with dialysis. Unlike entrepreneurs in the translation model who transform the world by interesting others, enduring trials, and becoming spokespersons for all, those patients who manage to displace and sustain the coexistence of multiple worlds avoid interesting, still less confronting, the hegemonic actors and claiming representation for themselves. This article suggests the displacement of agency as a generic alternative.									1	0	0	0	1	0162-2439		WOS:000330314200006
