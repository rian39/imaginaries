J	Teil, G				Teil, Genevieve			No Such Thing as Terroir?: Objectivities and the Regimes of Existence of Objects	SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES			English	Article						objectivity; thing; product; knowledge; science and society	WINE; PRODUITS; BORDEAUX; HERITAGE; CULTURE; QUALITY; FRANCE; MATTER; WORK; SOIL	The sociology of science has shown that the scientific quest for truth, framed by the search for objectivity was granting objects of knowledge the form of independent and autonomous things, "data" already given and preexisting their observation. But do "real" objects only fit the form of data or things? If not, to which other form and objectivity do they fit? The author considers the question by examining the dispute between scientists and vintners on the issue of terroir, a complex combination of viticulture and wine-making practices and agro-climactic factors, which gives wines a particular taste, or terroir typicity. For scientists who are unable to reduce it to a stable list of determining factors, terroir is an unfounded notion, an imaginary social construction, and an economic barrier. Producers, on the other hand, along with the wider distribution network of terroir wines, consider terroir as a real object, although one whose manifestations cannot be evaluated using the same procedures as those of scientists. By analyzing how proof of terroir is implemented, the author uncovers a regime of existence of objects different from the scientific regime: a pluralist one governed by critical discussion from which objects emerge as distributed results of a production process.

J	Reardon, J				Reardon, Jenny			The Democratic, Anti-Racist Genome? Technoscience at the Limits of Liberalism	SCIENCE AS CULTURE			English	Article						Genomics; race; democracy; liberalism; freedom; power	RACE; ANCESTRY; HISTORY; SCIENCE	The opening decade of this millennium witnessed genome scientists, policy makers, critical race theorists and world leaders standing together to pronounce the anti-racist democratic potential of human genomics. Understanding and assessing this rise of 'anti-racist, democratic genomics' requires distinguishing between two problems of power and science: the first characterized by what Michel Foucault labeled states of domination; the second by what he described as relations of power. When states of domination exist, as in the case of Nazi science, liberal efforts to extend new powers of participation and autonomy to research subjects may play important roles in redressing power imbalances between researchers and their subjects. However, when distinctions between scientist and research subject blur, as in the case of much human genomics, efforts to extend liberal rights to subjects of genomic studies-or genomic liberalism-may produce novel problems, including: (1) human genome scientists' loss of capacity to describe their objects of study; (2) disruption of research subjects' abilities to define themselves; and (3) lack of accountability for the unintended effects of efforts to democratize genomics. In these ways genomic liberalism may foster, at the same that it impedes, the co-constitution of knowledge and democratic subjects. It may create new forms of racism at the very moment that it explicitly seeks anti-racist ends. Addressing the problems created by this paradoxical position will require more sustained attention to and critique of the anti-racist and democratic imaginaries that increasingly animate technoscience.

J	Macnaghten, P; Guivant, JS				Macnaghten, Phil; Guivant, Julia S.			Converging citizens? Nanotechnology and the political imaginary of public engagement in Brazil and the United Kingdom	PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE			English	Article						cross-national research; Enlightenment; nanotechnology; narrative; political imaginary; public engagement	GOVERNANCE	This paper offers a comparative analysis of two public engagement exercises, conducted concurrently in the UK and Brazil. Following an account of how public engagement is situated in the political imaginary of the UK and Brazil, we set out a theoretical framework for such comparison, highlighting questions of narrative, political culture and civic epistemology. We then set out key differences in response, considering Brazilian citizen responses as prototypically more positive of (nano) technology, and as more amenable to and accepting of Enlightenment master narratives of technoscientific progress. UK citizen responses, by contrast, were more tragic, and more informed by resistant narratives of technoscientific failure. Although such distinctions are not absolute, they are nevertheless significant. We conclude by pointing to a set of analytical and normative challenges for how the science and technology studies analyst is to understand the politically contingent character of public engagement in the governance of science and technology.

J	Koch, G; Sorensen, E; Levidow, L				Koch, Gertraud; Sorensen, Estrid; Levidow, Les			Childish Science Introduction	SCIENCE AS CULTURE			English	Editorial Material						Scientific practice; childhood studies; children; STS; science education; imaginaries		How do children engage with science? How does science in one's childhood overlap with other scientific practices-or differ from them? According to prevalent developmental perspectives, particularly in science education, children's understandings are incomplete-an immature stage of adults' engagement with science. There follows a prescriptive model: an efficiently, playfully designed science education will generate scientifically educated young people, and perhaps even excellent scientists in the future. Such recent approaches to science education can be questioned via an ironic play with the concept of 'childish science', along three specific lines: children's life worlds are pervaded with/by science and are understood through children's imaginaries of science and their practices with science. More than simply incomplete adults, children develop their own sense-making through specific cultures, social relations and rationalities. When introduced to learning settings, specific materials and technologies matter; they represent, communicate and translate knowledges in ways dependent upon children's practices. These three aspects of 'childish science' provide a playful intervention for broadening prevalent approaches to science education. This special issue analyses science in childhood as a specifically 'childish' version of science. Children embed the world around them with meanings. Through these practices and meanings children become major actors in various settings, including schools, museums and their own homes. The analysis is informed by concepts drawn from childhood studies and Science and Technology Studies (STS). In terms of practical implications, educators should recognise the specific roles of childish science, which cannot be fully anticipated, controlled or designed. Science education should not be over-optimistic about its methods and outcomes. It is worth learning more about childish ways of engaging with science and how they relate to other versions of science.

J	Wohrer, V; Harrasser, D				Woehrer, Veronika; Harrasser, Doris			Playful Experiments: Gendered Performances in a Children's Museum	SCIENCE AS CULTURE			English	Article						Children's science culture; science education; children's museum; doing knowledge; gender and science	EDUCATION	While initiatives to popularise science for children and young people are on the rise, we know little about how children in practice interact with scientific objects in children's museums. Ethnographic research in a Viennese museum, focusing on children's interaction with an apparatus aimed to teach children about the mixing of colours, reveals the complexity and multifariousness of such practices. Imaginaries of mystery and witchcraft are inscribed in the object, while inscriptions of laboratory practices are also present. The ways in which children de-scribe this object resemble the production of experimental scientific knowledge: they try, contextualise, question, comment and reflect on the technological arrangement. Their practices and scientific performances integrate societal questions, applications, norms and values when they, for example, criticise the arrangement, perform polluting the Danube or sell coloured drinks. Doing science also means performing gender in this context: boys involve themselves more playfully and directly in the technology than girls, who remain more sceptical. Whereas the former are quick to play and invent stories, the latter take a different approach, commenting on and criticising the object. Despite the museum's efforts to equally address and involve boys and girls, the children's usage of the object differs.

Active Compounds and Atoms of Society: Plants, Bodies, Minds and Cultures in the Work of Kenyan Ethnobotanical Knowledge	SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE			English	Article						Africa; botany; ethnography; Kenya; medicine; parasitology; pharmacology; psychology	WESTERN KENYA; LUO; INTELLIGENCE; CHILDREN; HEALTH; GEOPHAGY	This paper examines a sequence of investigations in parasitology, botany, pharmacology, psychometrics and ethnopsychology focused on Kenyan village children's knowledge of medicinal herbs. We follow this work of making and ordering of knowledge, showing that the different disciplinary perspectives on bodies, medicines, knowledges, children and cultures produced by this research all sought the foundation of knowledge in reference to objective reality, and that they aimed to make the world known in the specific form of distinct and comparable entities with individual properties and capacities. Based on subsequent ethnographic observations of healing in the same village, we outline a different, contrasting modality of knowing, which places ontology above epistemology. Medicinal knowledge and its transformational capacity are here not located within entities but between them; not in objective reality but in effects; 'to know' means 'to come together' with the implication of having an effect on one another. We use this ethnographic sketch of a different form of knowing as a foil against which to contrast the imaginary that had shaped our previous research. Beyond the stark contrast between herbal village healing and pharmacological laboratory analysis, we expand our argument by moving from natural science to social science, from studies of plants and substances to those of humans, minds and cultures; from laboratories to ethno-psychological tests, cultural models, and eventually econometrics. We suggest that by reiterating a particular scientific imaginary, remaking humans (and non-human beings) as known things, a specific notion of man and a related political economy of knowledge is naturalized. Looking back at our involvement with this sequence of research, we realize that, contrary to our intentions, our inclusion as ` social scientists' into a multidisciplinary scientific project may have exacerbated rather than mitigated its potentially problematic effects.

J	Cutting, A				Cutting, Andrew			Ashes in Orbit: Celestis Spaceflights and the Invention of Post-cremationist Afterlives	SCIENCE AS CULTURE			English	Article						Cremation; funerals; memorial services; American way of death		Americans increasingly cremate rather than bury their dead, and post-cremation memorial services, such as ash-scattering ceremonies over sea and land, have emerged as a new arena of commercial enterprise and consumer spirituality. Celestis spaceflights, begun in 1997, elevate personal ash-scattering rituals into public performances of the technological sublime by sending tiny samples of cremated remains into earth orbit. The company's promotional materials construct the ashes' journey, inspired by science fiction and the space programmes, as a spiritual quest to the stars. Sending ashes into orbit, like cryonic suspension and human cloning, illustrates a cultural imaginary linking technology with the transcendence of mortality. While Celestis spaceflights have remained marginal to mainstream culture, their version of an afterlife journey invents a new kind of gothic undead: the posthumous cremain-astronaut, enjoying a heavenly, once-in-a-lifetime trip.

J	Smith, E				Smith, Elta			Imaginaries of Development: The Rockefeller Foundation and Rice Research	SCIENCE AS CULTURE			English	Article						Imaginaries; agriculture; Rockefeller Foundation; development; governance		This article is both a historical and contemporary analysis of the Rockefeller Foundation's changing role in rice research over the past 50 years, and though there are many overlaps between them, focuses on three broad periods: first, the RF's early work in rice research, particularly through the establishment of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and the Green Revolution era of the 1960s and 1970s; second, the development of the RF's rice biotechnology program in the 1980s; and third, the RF's focus on agricultural research in Africa, with rice research as a subset of their programmatic efforts, during the 1990s and beyond. Rice research in each of the different periods was driven by different framings of problems and potential solutions, incorporating wider ideologies, epistemologies, and key actors and networks, with the RF at the center. Viewed in this way, the Rockefeller Foundation's involvement in rice research cannot be seen 'simply' as an agricultural modernization project, but rather as simultaneously a sociopolitical project that extends particular modes of governance through homogenization and paternalism.

J	Hyysalo, S				Hyysalo, Sampsa			Representations of use and practice-bound imaginaries in automating the safety of the elderly	SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE			English	Article						elderly care; invention; practice-bound imaginary; technological frame; user-representation	SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION; TECHNOLOGY; WORK	The present paper examines how representations of prospective use became designed in a novel healthcare technology for elderly people. The case lends support to studies arguing that explicit investigations provide only a part of the representations of prospective use for technology design. It draws attention to a source of representations of use that is at once obvious and under-explored: the professional traditions of developers of technology. To examine this, the concept of practice-bound imaginary is introduced as an alternative to existing terms, such as technological frame. The concept enables better understanding of the interplay of multiple professional practices, the orientation of technology projects and the dynamics of how traditions affect the ideas about prospective use. These analytical possibilities were needed in the case-analysis, as the project was informed by several professional practices, each with their own sets of representations of use. Moreover, in many cases the representations of use were at once representations of viability, medical validity or manufacturability. They were often also inter-animated by adjoining representations from the same practice and compatible assumptions from other practices. Use was not only planned, configured or implicitly assumed, but also was inscribed by the models for conducting design, routine procedures and the messy interactions between people and materials. Designers themselves became aware of the implications of their solutions only after the artefact was reshaped by the resistance of the eventual users and refusers of the device.			sampsa.hyysalo@helsinki.fi					AKRICH M, 1995, MANAGING TECHNOLOGY, P167; Akrich M., 1992, SHAPING TECHNOLOGY B, P205; ARKRICH M., 1992, SHAPING TECHNOLOGY B, P259; Beck E.

J	GOTTWEIS, H				GOTTWEIS, H			GERMAN POLITICS OF GENETIC-ENGINEERING AND ITS DECONSTRUCTION	SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1992 Annual Meeting of the American-Political-Science-Association	SEP 03-06, 1992	CHICAGO, IL	Amer Polit Sci Assoc			COLLECTIVE ACTION; MOVEMENTS; POLICY	Policy-making, as exemplified by biotechnology policy, can be understood as an attempt to manage a field of discursivity, to construct regularity in a dispersed multitude of combinable elements. Following this perspective of politics as a textual process, the paper interprets the politicization of genetic engineering in Germany as a defence of the political as a regime of heterogeneity, as a field of 'dissensus' rather than 'consensus', and a rejection of the idea that the framing of technological transformation is an autonomous process. From its beginnings in the early 1970s, genetic engineering was symbolically entrenched as a key technology of the future, and as an integral element of the German politics of modernization. Attempts by new social movements and the Green Party to displace the egalitarian imaginary of democratic discourse into the politics of genetic engineering were construed by the political elites as an attack on the political order of post-World War II Germany. The 1990 Genetic Engineering Law attempted a closure of this controversy. But it is precisely the homogenizing idiom of this 'settlement' which continues to nourish the social movements and their radical challenge to the definitions and codings of the politics of genetic engineering.
