By manipulating the time the imaginary patients had to be on a transplantation waiting list, the utility of health at different periods of life could be compared. Except for the very young, respondents found health in the early periods of life to be twice as important as in the last decade of life. Health at age 35 had an utility somewhere between these two extremes. The responses of the elderly people showed remarkable resemblance to the students' responses, suggesting that the results reflect a general ethical standard. The values found were tested by means of a factorial design and found to fulfill the qualifications of an interval scale.									53	0	6	2	53	0277-9536		WOS:A1993LK32900004	8351530	
J	GOTTWEIS, H								GERMAN POLITICS OF GENETIC-ENGINEERING AND ITS DECONSTRUCTION								SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE				25	2			195	235		10.1177/030631295025002001			MAY 1995	1995	Policy-making, as exemplified by biotechnology policy, can be understood as an attempt to manage a field of discursivity, to construct regularity in a dispersed multitude of combinable elements. Following this perspective of politics as a textual process, the paper interprets the politicization of genetic engineering in Germany as a defence of the political as a regime of heterogeneity, as a field of 'dissensus' rather than 'consensus', and a rejection of the idea that the framing of technological transformation is an autonomous process. From its beginnings in the early 1970s, genetic engineering was symbolically entrenched as a key technology of the future, and as an integral element of the German politics of modernization. Attempts by new social movements and the Green Party to displace the egalitarian imaginary of democratic discourse into the politics of genetic engineering were construed by the political elites as an attack on the political order of post-World War II Germany. The 1990 Genetic Engineering Law attempted a closure of this controversy. But it is precisely the homogenizing idiom of this 'settlement' which continues to nourish the social movements and their radical challenge to the definitions and codings of the politics of genetic engineering.					1992 Annual Meeting of the American-Political-Science-Association	SEP 03-06, 1992	Amer Polit Sci Assoc	CHICAGO, IL	9	0	1	0	9	0306-3127		WOS:A1995RD68300001	11614113

This has led some to argue that the limits to a technology are a predictable function of its underlying physics and the structure of the dominant design. This paper uses the unexpectedly long old age of optical photolithographic alignment technology to suggest that this belief is probably incorrect. Unexpected changes in user needs and in the capabilities of component and complementary technologies permitted optical photolithography to dramatically exceed its 'natural' limits. However belief in the existence of a predictable life cycle had important implications for the evolution of the technology since it provided a framework within which industry participants embedded tacitly held, largely unexamined knowledge about the ways in which user needs and component and complementary technologies were likely to evolve. These results lend support to those that have argued that it is important to explore both the social context of a technology and the dynamics of the technology itself if one is to fully understand patterns of technological evolution.									56	0	0	0	56	0048-7333		WOS:A1995RD61200008

(See Panse et al. 1994, Ramadas et al. 1996). The results show that students: adopt kinematic criteria for deciding the inertial or non-inertial character of frames; consider this character to be a 'relative' property of two frames rather than an intrinsic property of a given frame; and equate pseudo-forces to 'imaginary' forces. Centrifugal force is associated with rotating objects rather than with rotating frames; the latter are localized by the finite extension of their associated objects. Anthropomorphic criteria are invoked to judge the existence of centrifugal force, which is regarded as a reaction (in the sense of Newton's third law) to the centripetal force on a rotating object.									8	0	0	0	8	0950-0693		WOS:A1996UU46500008		
J	Adams, J								A 'Richter scale for risk'? Scientific management of uncertainty versus management of scientific uncertainty								INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE REVIEWS				23	2			146	155					JUN 1998	1998	There have recently been calls in the UK for the development of a 'Richter scale for risk'. It is helpful when considering the merits of these proposals to distinguish three categories of risk: directly perceptible risk, e.g. climbing a tree, riding a bicycle; risks perceptible with the help of science, e.g, cholera and other infectious diseases; and virtual risks, about which scientists do not know or can not agree, e,g. BSE/CJD and suspected carcinogens. The professional management of directly perceptible risks is made difficult and frustrating by people insisting on being their own risk managers, and overriding the judgements of risk experts and the interventions of safety regulators. Risks perceived through science are framed in terms of probabilities. The Richter scale for risk seeks, by means of a table of 'benchmark risks', to help scientists communicate their knowledge of risk to the lay public. But frequently these probabilities are nothing but confident sounding expressions of uncertainty. We do not respond blankly to uncertainty; we impose meanings upon it, and act upon these meanings. Virtual risks may or may not be imaginary - but they hare real consequences. The diverse responses to the inconclusive scientific evidence about issues such as BSE;, pesticide residues, low level radiation, and global warming indicate that virtual risks are perceived through different cultural filters. The incoherent and inconclusive debates about such issues suggest the need for a better understanding of these fillers.

J	Cerezuelle, D								The limits of formal education: a report from France								TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY				20	3			307	315		10.1016/S0160-791X(98)00015-3			AUG 1998	1998	Formal education in modem technoscientific society undermines the informal foundations of learning, which are traditionally acquired outside of school in the home, at work, and in community environments. As students spend increasing amounts of their time in school, the singular focus of our educational system on the teaching of abstract knowledge-alien to students' personal experiences and without concrete meaning in their lives-leads to a "culture of pretending" in which curricula are designed and degrees awarded based on the imaginary capacities of students. From the perspective of a teacher, this paper relates my personal observations and conclusions on the effects of the technoscientific educational system on contemporary French students and, by extension, on French society. A prudent "deschooling" of society is called for, as well as renunciation of the technoscientific ideal. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Reiner, M; Gilbert, J								Epistemological resources for thought experimentation in science learning								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION				22	5			489	506		10.1080/095006900289741			MAY 2000	2000	Thought Experiments (TEs) are reasoning processes that are based on 'results' of an experiment carried out in thought. What is the validity of an experiment - that has not been actually executed - for knowledge about the physical world! What are the features that make it distinctive and how do we integrate it into learning environments to support such thought processes! This study suggests that a thought experiment draws on three epistemological resources: conceptual-logical inferences, visual imagery and bodily-motor experience. We start by stating how students' TEs are related to recent research on learning science and then proceed to describe the nature of TEs. The central part of the paper deals with cognitive theories and empirical examples of visual imagery and bodily imagery. It also deals with how these enable implicit knowledge about the world to be retrieved. Students may have, but are not aware of, such knowledge for it is hidden when learning is only based on format representations. We show that imagination is structured, goal-oriented, based on prior experiential imagery and internally coherent. Students can, for example, mentally rotate objects at constant velocity. Students can 'zoom in and out' to inspect imaginary situations, transfer objects, predict paths of imaginary moving objects and imagine the impact of forces on mechanical systems. We show thar the TEs are powerful because of these capabilities. We further claim that these are not exploited by school learning environments and offer a first step towards understanding imagery in science learning.									43	0	0	2	43	0950-0693		WOS:000087033800003		
J	Wragg, JA; Robinson, EJ; Lilford, RJ								Information presentation and decisions to enter clinical trials: a hypothetical trial of hormone replacement therapy								SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE				51	3			453	462		10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00477-3			AUG 2000	2000	We examined recruitment to an imaginary trial of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) following two different styles of information about HRT. We predicted that for treatments which, like HRT, are available outside a trial, people offered the facts as currently known would be less likely to remain unsure about the relative costs and benefits, and so less likely to agree to enter a randomised trial. In contrast, when the information provided reflected the current state of uncertainty which justified the trial, we predicted that people would be less likely to form a preference for one treatment arm over the other, and so more likely to agree to enter a trial. One hundred women aged 25-40 years were informed about HRT via a video and an information leaflet. For half the participants the information was Framed in a way which emphasised the current state of uncertainty about the relative costs and benefits of HRT, and in that respect it reflected the justification for a trial. This version was considered to be similar in style to information commonly provided to potential trial participants. For half the participants the same information was framed in a way which offered explicit numerical detail about currently known facts, and in that respect it was considered to be similar in style to information commonly available to doctors prior to a trial. Women learned as much about HRT in the two conditions, but women given the explicit versions were more likely (i) to hold a stronger view about whether or not they would take HRT (ratings wire not elicited from the first 30 participants in this condition. N = 20, p < 0.05 1 tailed) and (ii) to refuse entry to the trial (N = 50, p < 0.05 2 tailed). Those who, given the explicit version, agreed rather than refused to enter the trial, scored higher on believing that others control their health (p < 0.01 2 tailed). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The questions for investigation were: how does the child contextualize the science experience on the journal page? How do child-produced graphics on the journal page reflect the children's experiences with other school texts? The study found that children recontextualized their understandings of the science investigation and phenomena by using three types of mental contexts that were reflected in their science journals: these contexts were imaginary, experienced, and investigative worlds. By drawing on these three worlds or internal contexts, the children were able to pull the external phenomenon into an internal context that was familiar to them. The child's construction of ideas about a current science experience as expressed on the journal page may reflect experiences with other conventional texts. In this study the children's representations of their imaginary, experienced and/or investigative worlds were shaped by other texts and structures such as school science texts.

Drawing on the work of Henri LeFebvre, Edward Casey, Jeffrey Malpas, and Michel Foucault, a spatial analysis examines the constitutive roles of movement, social structure, and power in determining the prisoner's access to health care. The research methodology utilizes quantitative and qualitative analysis of women prisoners' attempts to get treatment for their health problems. The narratives of these often-failed attempts construct prison as a place where health care access is continually thwarted by rules, custodial priorities, poor health care management, incompetence, and indifference. Analysis of spatial practices, representations of space, and spaces of representation demonstrate the imposition of structural ordering, its naturalization, and the role of narrative in questioning the order, thereby creating possibilities for imaginary and real places where the prisoners' health needs can be met. Simultaneously, this analysis illuminates basic ethical questions about the limitations of human connection and medical caring in prison settings, regardless of the personal motivation of the caregiver.

J	Davis, KK; Davis, JS; Dowler, L								In motion, out of place: the public space(s) of Tourette Syndrome								SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE				59	1			103	112		10.1016/j.socscimed.2003.10.008			JUL 2004	2004	According to Doris Humphrey, "Nothing so clearly or inevitably reveals the inner man [sic] than movement and gesture... the moment you move you stand revealed, for good or ill, for what you are" (The dance notebook, 1984). Tourette Syndrome, characterized by motor and vocal tics, elicits stigma for just this reason: the tics and movements it causes have revealed Touretters as something beyond the 'normal.' This paper examines the ways Touretters are perceived and received in public spaces, using published illness narratives and film documentaries to address the question of why the reactions TS invokes are so severe. We will demonstrate how the stigma surrounding the disorder stems from the perception of Touretters as disruptive to the order and health of public spaces. To describe the production of stigma and the violent reactions to TS individuals, we draw upon theories of bodies and performativity from feminist studies, Catherine Waldby's work with the imaginary anatomy, and geographical perspectives on the social construction of space. The geographic studies of space are used to illuminate discussions of people's life experiences by showing how body movements associated with illness produce stigma by transgressing the unwritten codes that govern particular public spaces. Our intention in this paper is not to introduce new empirical data, but rather to analyze the mechanisms of stigma formation produced by the complex relationships between the functioning of social spaces and individuals' experiences of illness.

J	Reiner, M; Gilbert, JK								The symbiotic roles of empirical experimentation and thought experimentation in the learning of physics								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION				26	15			1819	1834		10.1080/0950069042000205440			DEC 17 2004	2004	This study was an attempt to identify the epistemological roots of knowledge when students carry out hands-on experiments in physics. We found that, within the context of designing a solution to a stated problem, subjects constructed and ran thought experiments intertwined within the processes of conducting physical experiments. We show that the process of alternating between these two modes-empirically experimenting and experimenting in thought-leads towards a convergence on scientifically acceptable concepts. We call this process mutual projection. In the process of mutual projection, external representations were generated. Objects in the physical environment were represented in an imaginary world and these representations were associated with processes in the physical world. It is through this coupling that constituents of both the imaginary world and the physical world gain meaning. We further show that the external representations are rooted in sensory interaction and constitute a semi-symbolic pictorial communication system, a sort of primitive 'language', which is developed as the practical work continues. The constituents of this pictorial communication system are used in the thought experiments taking place in association with the empirical experimentation. The results of this study provide a model of physics learning during hands-on experimentation.									9	0	0	0	9	0950-0693		WOS:000226056100001

We examine policy dynamics in both the United States and United Kingdom aimed at both opening up, and closing down, the role of the social sciences in nanotechnologies. We then set out a prospective agenda for the social sciences and its potential in the future shaping of nanotechnology research and innovation processes. The emergent, undetermined nature of nanotechnologies calls for an open, experimental, and interdisciplinary model of social science research.

J	Hyysalo, Sampsa								Representations of use and practice-bound imaginaries in automating the safety of the elderly								SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE				36	4			599	626		10.1177/0306312706058426			AUG 2006	2006	The present paper examines how representations of prospective use became designed in a novel healthcare technology for elderly people. The case lends support to studies arguing that explicit investigations provide only a part of the representations of prospective use for technology design. It draws attention to a source of representations of use that is at once obvious and under-explored: the professional traditions of developers of technology. To examine this, the concept of practice-bound imaginary is introduced as an alternative to existing terms, such as technological frame. The concept enables better understanding of the interplay of multiple professional practices, the orientation of technology projects and the dynamics of how traditions affect the ideas about prospective use. These analytical possibilities were needed in the case-analysis, as the project was informed by several professional practices, each with their own sets of representations of use. Moreover, in many cases the representations of use were at once representations of viability, medical validity or manufacturability. They were often also inter-animated by adjoining representations from the same practice and compatible assumptions from other practices. Use was not only planned, configured or implicitly assumed, but also was inscribed by the models for conducting design, routine procedures and the messy interactions between people and materials. Designers themselves became aware of the implications of their solutions only after the artefact was reshaped by the resistance of the eventual users and refusers of the device.									15	0	0	0	15	0306-3127		WOS:000239897500004

To explore these relationships, this paper links Mary Shelley's Frankenstein-a book often hailed as the first science fiction novel-to two earlier works which are now less well known: Edmond Halley's article about terrestrial magnetism, in which he suggested that God had created inhabited illuminated cavities inside the earth; and a satirical fantasy voyage written by the Danish author Ludvig Holberg, but published anonymously as Niels Klim's journey to the underground and immediately translated into many languages. Attention is focussed on how the ambiguous presentation of these and other texts blurs any straightforward classification of genres. The aim of examining these writers together is not to search for direct mappings from one project to another, but instead to introduce Holberg's unfamiliar yet important book and also to cast new light on Frankenstein, one of England's most famous works of literature.

J	Grace, Victoria M.; Daniels, Ken R.; Gillett, Wayne				Gillett, Wayne/A-8579-2012				The donor, the father, and the imaginary constitution of the family: Parents' constructions in the case of donor insemination								SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE				66	2			301	314		10.1016/j.socscimed.2007.08.029			JAN 2008	2008	Current international policy trends in the field of medically assisted conception are moving towards increased openness of information regarding the nature of conception where donated gametes are involved. In the case of donor insemination this means that the donor is no longer anonymous, offspring have the right to access information about the donor's identity, and parents are encouraged to tell children the nature of their donor-assisted conception. Until recently, however, the practice of donor insemination has tended to create the conditions for ignoring, or erasing, the existence of the donor as the provider of the gametes. Changing policy creates numerous challenges to this erasure, and to traditional conceptualisations of the father. This research is based on analysis of the narratives of a group of 41 New Zealand couples who conceived children with the assistance of donor insemination 15-18 years prior. This article focuses on their talk about the donor. The parents' negation of the donor supports the normative formation of 'family', and is in turn supported by an instrumental and de-personalising discourse in relation to the donor. A tension is created within the parents' talk whereby donors are negated and yet simultaneously appear as persons. We explore this discursive construction, suggesting that a new framework for thinking about donated gametes and the role of the donor is influencing parents' narrations and understandings of family. We discuss these influences and examine their implications, particularly with respect to a separation of the bio-genetic from the social-environmental. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Her arguments do not address serious problems of logic, context, and contrary evidence. Her particular insistence on the influence of the torture of witches ignores Bacon's skepticism about witchcraft as superstitious or imaginary. Nor do the writings of his successors sustain her claim that they carried forward his supposed program to abuse nature. We should be wary of metaphorical generalizations that ignore the context of the metaphor, the larger intent of the writers, and the fundamental limitations of such metaphors as descriptions of science.There are no scientific methods which alone lead to knowledge! We have to tackle things experimentally, now angry with them and now kind, and be successively just, passionate, and cold with them. One person addresses things as a policeman, a second as a father confessor, a third as an inquisitive wanderer. Something can be wrung from them now with sympathy, now with force; reverence for their secrets will take one person forwards, indiscretion and roguishness in revealing their secrets will do the same for another. We investigators are, like all conquerors, discoverers, seafarers, adventurers, of an audacious morality and must reconcile ourselves to being considered on the whole evil.									2	0	0	0	2	0021-1753		WOS:000257895800003	18702399

Inevitabilism consists in the denial of this claim. in this paper, I try both to give a clear content to contingentism, especially in the field of physics, and to argue for its plausibility, while acknowledging that it is extremely hard to give an argument that establishes its validity in a compelling way. By contrasting the history of science with that of geographic discoveries and the difficulties faced by any inevitabilist account of the former, I consider three different characterizations of the success of science, truth, adequacy to the phenomena, and robust fit, and analyze their consequences for the meaning and plausibility of contingentism. I retain the third characterization of scientific success and argue that the role played by creativity in scientific activities and the fact that there is a multiplicity of paths that researchers can legitimately follow in order to obtain a robust fit jointly support a qualified version of contingentism.

J	Fleer, Marilyn								Supporting Scientific Conceptual Consciousness or Learning in 'a Roundabout Way' in Play-based Contexts								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION				31	8			1069	1089	PII 791718123	10.1080/09500690801953161			2009	2009	Little change has been noted over 10 years of research into teacher knowledge and confidence to teach science in the early and primary years of schooling. There is a significant body of research demonstrating that early childhood and primary teachers lack confidence and competence in teaching science. However, much of this research blames the victim, and offers little analysis for the systemic reasons for teachers' confidence and competence in science education other than a lack of science knowledge. This paper reports on a study that examined teacher philosophy and pedagogical practices within the context of an analysis of children's concept formation within playful early childhood settings. Through teacher interviews, video recordings of science play, and photographic documentation of children's science activities in one rural preschool, it was noted that teacher philosophy about how young children learn is a significant contributing factor to learning in science. It is argued that teacher philosophy makes more of a difference to children's scientific learning than does teacher confidence to teach science or knowledge of science. The study also shows that without a mediational scientific framework for using materials in play-based contexts, children will generate their own imaginary, often non-scientific, narratives for making sense of the materials provided.									13	0	0	0	13	0950-0693		WOS:000265992600005		
J	Cutting, Andrew								Ashes in Orbit: Celestis Spaceflights and the Invention of Post-cremationist Afterlives								SCIENCE AS CULTURE				18	3	SI		355	369		10.1080/09505430903122992			2009	2009	Americans increasingly cremate rather than bury their dead, and post-cremation memorial services, such as ash-scattering ceremonies over sea and land, have emerged as a new arena of commercial enterprise and consumer spirituality. Celestis spaceflights, begun in 1997, elevate personal ash-scattering rituals into public performances of the technological sublime by sending tiny samples of cremated remains into earth orbit. The company's promotional materials construct the ashes' journey, inspired by science fiction and the space programmes, as a spiritual quest to the stars. Sending ashes into orbit, like cryonic suspension and human cloning, illustrates a cultural imaginary linking technology with the transcendence of mortality. While Celestis spaceflights have remained marginal to mainstream culture, their version of an afterlife journey invents a new kind of gothic undead: the posthumous cremain-astronaut, enjoying a heavenly, once-in-a-lifetime trip.									1	0	0	0	1	0950-5431		WOS:000207920300007		
J	Smith, Elta								Imaginaries of Development: The Rockefeller Foundation and Rice Research								SCIENCE AS CULTURE				18	4			461	482		10.1080/09505430903186070			2009	2009	This article is both a historical and contemporary analysis of the Rockefeller Foundation's changing role in rice research over the past 50 years, and though there are many overlaps between them, focuses on three broad periods: first, the RF's early work in rice research, particularly through the establishment of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and the Green Revolution era of the 1960s and 1970s; second, the development of the RF's rice biotechnology program in the 1980s; and third, the RF's focus on agricultural research in Africa, with rice research as a subset of their programmatic efforts, during the 1990s and beyond. Rice research in each of the different periods was driven by different framings of problems and potential solutions, incorporating wider ideologies, epistemologies, and key actors and networks, with the RF at the center. Viewed in this way, the Rockefeller Foundation's involvement in rice research cannot be seen 'simply' as an agricultural modernization project, but rather as simultaneously a sociopolitical project that extends particular modes of governance through homogenization and paternalism.									1	0	0	0	1	0950-5431		WOS:000207920500005		
J	Jasanoff, Sheila; Kim, Sang-Hyun								Containing the Atom: Sociotechnical Imaginaries and Nuclear Power in the United States and South Korea								MINERVA				47	2			119	146		10.1007/s11024-009-9124-4			JUN 2009	2009	STS research has devoted relatively little attention to the promotion and reception of science and technology by non-scientific actors and institutions. One consequence is that the relationship of science and technology to political power has tended to remain undertheorized. This article aims to fill that gap by introducing the concept of "sociotechnical imaginaries." Through a comparative examination of the development and regulation of nuclear power in the US and South Korea, the article demonstrates the analytic potential of the imaginaries concept. Although nuclear power and nationhood have long been imagined together in both countries, the nature of those imaginations has remained strikingly different. In the US, the state's central move was to present itself as a responsible regulator of a potentially runaway technology that demands effective "containment." In South Korea, the dominant imaginary was of "atoms for development" which the state not only imported but incorporated into its scientific, technological and political practices. In turn, these disparate imaginaries have underwritten very different responses to a variety of nuclear shocks and challenges, such as Three Mile Island (TMI), Chernobyl, and the spread of the anti-nuclear movement.									53	0	2	0	53	0026-4695		WOS:000268247700001		
J	Domski, Mary								The intelligibility of motion and construction: Descartes' early mathematics and metaphysics, 1619-1637								STUDIES IN HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE				40	2			119	130		10.1016/j.shpsa.2009.03.003			JUN 2009	2009	I argue for an interpretation of the connection between Descartes' early mathematics and metaphysics that centers on the standard of geometrical intelligibility that characterizes Descartes' mathematical work during the period 1619 to 1637. This approach remains sensitive to the innovations of Descartes' system of geometry and, I claim, sheds important light on the relationship between his landmark Geometry (1637) and his first metaphysics of nature, which is presented in Le monde (1633). In particular, I argue that the same standard of clear and distinct motions for construction that allows Descartes to distinguish 'geometric' from 'imaginary' curves in the domain of mathematics is adopted in Le monde as Descartes details God's construction of nature. I also show how, on this interpretation, the metaphysics of Le monde can fruitfully be brought to bear on Descartes' attempted solution to the Pappus problem, which he presents in Book I of the Geometry. My general goal is to show that attention to the standard of intelligibility Descartes invokes in these different areas of inquiry grants us a richer view of the connection between his early mathematics and philosophy than an approach that assumes a common method is what binds his work in these domains together.

J	Geissler, P. Wenzel; Prince, Ruth J.								Active Compounds and Atoms of Society: Plants, Bodies, Minds and Cultures in the Work of Kenyan Ethnobotanical Knowledge								SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE				39	4			599	634		10.1177/0306312709104075			AUG 2009	2009	This paper examines a sequence of investigations in parasitology, botany, pharmacology, psychometrics and ethnopsychology focused on Kenyan village children's knowledge of medicinal herbs. We follow this work of making and ordering of knowledge, showing that the different disciplinary perspectives on bodies, medicines, knowledges, children and cultures produced by this research all sought the foundation of knowledge in reference to objective reality, and that they aimed to make the world known in the specific form of distinct and comparable entities with individual properties and capacities. Based on subsequent ethnographic observations of healing in the same village, we outline a different, contrasting modality of knowing, which places ontology above epistemology. Medicinal knowledge and its transformational capacity are here not located within entities but between them; not in objective reality but in effects; 'to know' means 'to come together' with the implication of having an effect on one another. We use this ethnographic sketch of a different form of knowing as a foil against which to contrast the imaginary that had shaped our previous research. Beyond the stark contrast between herbal village healing and pharmacological laboratory analysis, we expand our argument by moving from natural science to social science, from studies of plants and substances to those of humans, minds and cultures; from laboratories to ethno-psychological tests, cultural models, and eventually econometrics. We suggest that by reiterating a particular scientific imaginary, remaking humans (and non-human beings) as known things, a specific notion of man and a related political economy of knowledge is naturalized. Looking back at our involvement with this sequence of research, we realize that, contrary to our intentions, our inclusion as ` social scientists' into a multidisciplinary scientific project may have exacerbated rather than mitigated its potentially problematic effects.									2	0	1	0	2	0306-3127		WOS:000267439300004	19848110	
J	Cohen, Sarah R.								Searching the animal psyche with Charles Le Brun								ANNALS OF SCIENCE				67	3			353	382	PII 923565270	10.1080/00033790.2010.488143			2010	2010	Around 1670 the French court painter and Academician Charles Le Brun produced a series of drawings featuring naturalistic animal heads, as well as imaginary heads in which he refashioned various nonhuman animal species to make humanoid physiognomies. What were the purpose and significance of these unusual works? I argue that they show Le Brun's interest in what we today would call animal psychology: focusing upon the sensory organs and their connections with the animal's brain, Le Brun studied his animals as conscious protagonists of the natural realm. One source that may have served him in this project was Marin Cureau de La Chambre's De la Connoissance des bestes of 1645, in which the physician argued that animals possess a conscious soul grounded in the senses. However, Le Brun's animal-humans have no clear place in the artist's taxonomynor, indeed, in any seventeenth-century understandings of species. It is rather John Locke, at his most skeptical, who offers the best parallel in the realm of natural philosophy to Le Brun's unsettling animal-humans. Probably without meaning to, Le Brun demonstrated through his eerie, boundary-crossing creatures the limits of visual classification.									0	0	0	0	0	0003-3790		WOS:000279439200004	20853815

These drama activities were part of two integrated science-literacy units, Matter and Forest, which we developed and implemented in six urban primary-school (grades 1st-3rd) classrooms. We examine and discuss the possibilities and challenges that arise as children and teachers engaged in scientific knowing through such experiences. We use Halliday's (1978. Language as social semiotic: The social interpretation of language and meaning. Baltimore, MD: University Park Press) three metafunctions of communicative activity-ideational, interpersonal, and textual-to map out the place of the multimodal drama genre in elementary urban school science classrooms of young children. As the children talked, moved, gestured, and positioned themselves in space, they constructed and shared meanings with their peers and their teachers as they enacted their roles, Through their bodies they negotiated ambiguity and re-articulated understandings, thus marking this embodied meaning making as it powerful way to engage with science. Furthermore, children's whole bodies became central, explicit tools used to accomplish the goal of representing this imaginary scientific world, as their teachers helped them differentiate it from the real world of the model they were enacting. Their bodies operated on multiple mediated levels: as material objects that moved through space, as social objects that negotiated classroom relationships and rules, and as metaphorical entities that stood for water molecules in different states of matter or for plants, animals. or non-living entities in a forest food web. Children simultaneously negotiated meanings across all of these levels, and in doing so, acted out improvisational drama as they thought and talked science. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Silver, Joanna; Reavey, Paula								"He's a good-looking chap aint he?": Narrative and visualisations of self in body dysmorphic disorder								SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE				70	10			1641	1647		10.1016/j.socscimed.2009.11.042			MAY 2010	2010	Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is a condition marked by a distressing preoccupation with an imaginary or minor defect in a facial feature or a localised part of the body. However, the link between such excessive preoccupation and perceptions of self throughout the life course has rarely been examined. The aim of this study was to examine narrative accounts of the self across different life-time periods. Eleven participants diagnosed with BDD in England were recruited from the National Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) clinic and a BDD self-help group. In the context of a semi-structured interview participants presented photographs of themselves across a variety of time periods and drew a self-portrait to prompt memory and generate discussion. Transcribed interviews were analysed using Michele Crossley's (2000) narrative analytic approach. The findings suggest that the majority of participants perceived their past self as excessively attractive. Rather than believing that the alteration of their current appearance would rid them of BDD, participants indicated that a return to their former infantile and pure self that was devoid of blemish, defects and emotional responsibility would provide comfort. These findings indicate that the difficulties associated with appearance are less to do with beauty per se, but are more likely associated with narratives of loss, aging and decline and death.

J	Lemov, Rebecca								"Hypothetical Machines" The Science Fiction Dreams of Cold War Social Science								ISIS				101	2			401	411					JUN 2010	2010	The introspectometer was a "hypothetical machine" Robert K. Merton introduced in the course of a 1956 how-to manual describing an actual research technique, the focused interview. This technique, in turn, formed the basis of wartime morale research and consumer behavior studies as well as perhaps the most ubiquitous social science tool, the focus group. This essay explores a new perspective on Cold War social science made possible by comparing two kinds of apparatuses: one real, the other imaginary. Even as Merton explored the nightmare potential of such machines, he suggested that the clear aim of social science was to build them or their functional equivalent: recording machines to access a person's experiential stream of reality, with the ability to turn this stream into real-time data. In this way, the introspectometer marks and symbolizes a broader entry during the Cold War of science-fiction-style aspirations into methodological prescriptions and procedural manuals. This essay considers the growth of the genre of methodological visions and revisions, painstakingly argued and absorbed, but punctuated by sci-fi aims to transform "the human" and build newly penetrating machines. It also considers the place of the nearly real-, and the artificial "near-substitute" as part of an experimental urge that animated these sciences.									3	0	0	0	3	0021-1753		WOS:000278807900009	20718281

Delinking themselves from the modern-colonial imaginary, I argue, the South Central Farmers enact a geo-body politics of knowledge that is consistently subverted, even by supporters, vis-a-vis modern-colonial rationality. Despite their apparent instrumental failure, the South Central Farmers succeeded in enacting a decolonial challenge, which compels us as scholars to rethink our approach to the Farmers' specific activism and Latin@ vernacular discourse generally.									2	0	0	0	2	1752-4032		WOS:000299817900010

Scientists and lawyers are imagining and actively fostering the realization of futures in which neuroscience will play a prominent role in the activity of courts. In this article I take these debates as my empirical object. I trace the emergence of neurolegal discourse, explore its focus on free will and lie detection, and show how expectations about the potential role neuroscience might play in the law are being embedded in new research programs and funding streams. In so doing, I analyze the role of particular "sociotechnical imaginaries" in stimulating, directing and restricting neurolegal discourse and highlight the ways in which new visions of law, science and scientists are produced in the process. Sociotechnical imaginaries are shown to be salient in structuring anticipatory discourse, and represent a key target for social scientific intervention in such debates.									9	0	0	0	9	1463-6778		WOS:000288002400002		
J	Koch, Gertraud; Sorensen, Estrid; Levidow, Les								Childish Science Introduction								SCIENCE AS CULTURE				20	4	SI		421	431		10.1080/09505431.2011.617950			2011	2011	How do children engage with science? How does science in one's childhood overlap with other scientific practices-or differ from them? According to prevalent developmental perspectives, particularly in science education, children's understandings are incomplete-an immature stage of adults' engagement with science. There follows a prescriptive model: an efficiently, playfully designed science education will generate scientifically educated young people, and perhaps even excellent scientists in the future.Such recent approaches to science education can be questioned via an ironic play with the concept of 'childish science', along three specific lines: children's life worlds are pervaded with/by science and are understood through children's imaginaries of science and their practices with science. More than simply incomplete adults, children develop their own sense-making through specific cultures, social relations and rationalities. When introduced to learning settings, specific materials and technologies matter; they represent, communicate and translate knowledges in ways dependent upon children's practices.These three aspects of 'childish science' provide a playful intervention for broadening prevalent approaches to science education. This special issue analyses science in childhood as a specifically 'childish' version of science. Children embed the world around them with meanings. Through these practices and meanings children become major actors in various settings, including schools, museums and their own homes. The analysis is informed by concepts drawn from childhood studies and Science and Technology Studies (STS).In terms of practical implications, educators should recognise the specific roles of childish science, which cannot be fully anticipated, controlled or designed. Science education should not be over-optimistic about its methods and outcomes. It is worth learning more about childish ways of engaging with science and how they relate to other versions of science.									1	0	0	0	1	0950-5431		WOS:000299214300001

Ethnographic research in a Viennese museum, focusing on children's interaction with an apparatus aimed to teach children about the mixing of colours, reveals the complexity and multifariousness of such practices. Imaginaries of mystery and witchcraft are inscribed in the object, while inscriptions of laboratory practices are also present. The ways in which children de-scribe this object resemble the production of experimental scientific knowledge: they try, contextualise, question, comment and reflect on the technological arrangement. Their practices and scientific performances integrate societal questions, applications, norms and values when they, for example, criticise the arrangement, perform polluting the Danube or sell coloured drinks. Doing science also means performing gender in this context: boys involve themselves more playfully and directly in the technology than girls, who remain more sceptical. Whereas the former are quick to play and invent stories, the latter take a different approach, commenting on and criticising the object. Despite the museum's efforts to equally address and involve boys and girls, the children's usage of the object differs.									0	0	0	1	1	0950-5431		WOS:000299214300004

Investigating the problematisation of the Australian general public in pandemic influenza control								SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE				72	6			912	918		10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.01.016			MAR 2011	2011	This article examines how pandemic influenza control policies interpellate the public. We analyse Australian pandemic control documents and key informant interviews, with reference to the H1N1 virus in 2009. Our analysis suggests that the episodic and uncertain features of pandemic influenza give control measures a pronounced tactical character. The general public is seen as passive and, in some cases, vulnerable to pandemic influenza. Communication focuses on promoting public compliance with prescribed guidelines, but without inspiring complacency, panic or other unruly responses. These assumptions depend, however, on a limited social imaginary of publics responding to pandemics. Drawing on Foucault, we consider how it is that these assumptions regarding the public responses to pandemics have taken their present form. We show that the virological modelling used in planning and health securitisation both separate pandemic control from its publics. Further, these approaches to planning rely on a restricted view of human agency and therefore preclude alternatives to compliance-complacency-panic and, as we suggest, compromise pandemic control. On this basis we argue that effective pandemic control requires a systematic dialogue with the publics it seeks to prepare in anticipation of the event of pandemic influenza. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Nanotechnology and the political imaginary of public engagement in Brazil and the United Kingdom								PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE				20	2			207	220		10.1177/0963662510379084			MAR 2011	2011	This paper offers a comparative analysis of two public engagement exercises, conducted concurrently in the UK and Brazil. Following an account of how public engagement is situated in the political imaginary of the UK and Brazil, we set out a theoretical framework for such comparison, highlighting questions of narrative, political culture and civic epistemology. We then set out key differences in response, considering Brazilian citizen responses as prototypically more positive of (nano) technology, and as more amenable to and accepting of Enlightenment master narratives of technoscientific progress. UK citizen responses, by contrast, were more tragic, and more informed by resistant narratives of technoscientific failure. Although such distinctions are not absolute, they are nevertheless significant. We conclude by pointing to a set of analytical and normative challenges for how the science and technology studies analyst is to understand the politically contingent character of public engagement in the governance of science and technology.									7	0	0	1	7	0963-6625		WOS:000287848500005		
J	Vorms, Marion								Representing with imaginary models: Formats matter								STUDIES IN HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE				42	2	SI		287	295		10.1016/j.shpsa.2010.11.036			JUN 2011	2011	Models such as the simple pendulum, isolated populations, and perfectly rational agents, play a central role in theorising. It is now widely acknowledged that a study of scientific representation should focus on the role of such imaginary entities in scientists' reasoning. However, the question is most of the time cast as follows: How can fictional or abstract entities represent the phenomena? In this paper, I show that this question is not well posed. First, I clarify the notion of representation, and I emphasise the importance of what I call the "format" of a representation for the inferences agents can draw from it. Then, I show that the very same model can be presented under different formats, which do not enable scientists to perform the same inferences. Assuming that the main function of a representation is to allow one to draw predictions and explanations of the phenomena by reasoning with it, I conclude that imaginary models in abstracto are not used as representations: scientists always reason with formatted representations. Therefore, the problem of scientific representation does not lie in the relationship of imaginary entities with real systems. One should rather focus on the variety of the formats that are used in scientific practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									3	0	0	0	3	0039-3681		WOS:000291274800005		
J	Reardon, Jenny								The Democratic, Anti-Racist Genome? Technoscience at the Limits of Liberalism								SCIENCE AS CULTURE				21	1			25	47		10.1080/09505431.2011.565322			2012	2012	The opening decade of this millennium witnessed genome scientists, policy makers, critical race theorists and world leaders standing together to pronounce the anti-racist democratic potential of human genomics. Understanding and assessing this rise of 'anti-racist, democratic genomics' requires distinguishing between two problems of power and science: the first characterized by what Michel Foucault labeled states of domination; the second by what he described as relations of power. When states of domination exist, as in the case of Nazi science, liberal efforts to extend new powers of participation and autonomy to research subjects may play important roles in redressing power imbalances between researchers and their subjects. However, when distinctions between scientist and research subject blur, as in the case of much human genomics, efforts to extend liberal rights to subjects of genomic studies-or genomic liberalism-may produce novel problems, including: (1) human genome scientists' loss of capacity to describe their objects of study; (2) disruption of research subjects' abilities to define themselves; and (3) lack of accountability for the unintended effects of efforts to democratize genomics. In these ways genomic liberalism may foster, at the same that it impedes, the co-constitution of knowledge and democratic subjects. It may create new forms of racism at the very moment that it explicitly seeks anti-racist ends. Addressing the problems created by this paradoxical position will require more sustained attention to and critique of the anti-racist and democratic imaginaries that increasingly animate technoscience.									5	0	0	0	5	0950-5431		WOS:000302291400002

Using correspondents' replies to the Spring 2006 Mass Observation Directive "Genes, Genetics and Cloning," the analysis focuses on continuities and tensions in their discursive repertoires. The argument examines (1) the ways in which knowledge is made sense of in these accounts; and (2) the discrepancy between an appreciation of the benefits of using DNA identification techniques in police work and a more critical attitude towards a wider national DNA database. The conclusion reflects on the need for a wider scope in research on public understandings of science, which looks beyond targeted consultations and specific publics, and provides more textured data to document collective views on the development and governance of forensic DNA technologies.									3	0	1	0	3	1463-6778		WOS:000306738800004

They provide in-depth descriptions of three sci-fi novels: Neuromancer, The Player of Games, and Kethani. They explore how ethical concerns are framed within the imaginary world of these novels, emphasizing that this framing is usually ambivalent, embedded within lived narratives, as well as future and collectively oriented. Because they evoke shared imaginaries, sci-fi novels appear as useful to trigger debate on new technologies.									0	0	0	0	0	1075-5470		WOS:000301801200002		
J	Teil, Genevieve								No Such Thing as Terroir?: Objectivities and the Regimes of Existence of Objects								SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES				37	5			478	505		10.1177/0162243911423843			SEP 2012	2012	The sociology of science has shown that the scientific quest for truth, framed by the search for objectivity was granting objects of knowledge the form of independent and autonomous things, "data" already given and preexisting their observation. But do "real" objects only fit the form of data or things? If not, to which other form and objectivity do they fit? The author considers the question by examining the dispute between scientists and vintners on the issue of terroir, a complex combination of viticulture and wine-making practices and agro-climactic factors, which gives wines a particular taste, or terroir typicity. For scientists who are unable to reduce it to a stable list of determining factors, terroir is an unfounded notion, an imaginary social construction, and an economic barrier. Producers, on the other hand, along with the wider distribution network of terroir wines, consider terroir as a real object, although one whose manifestations cannot be evaluated using the same procedures as those of scientists. By analyzing how proof of terroir is implemented, the author uncovers a regime of existence of objects different from the scientific regime: a pluralist one governed by critical discussion from which objects emerge as distributed results of a production process.									1	0	0	0	1	0162-2439		WOS:000308408400003		
J	Arthur, Richard T. W.								Virtual Processes and Quantum Tunnelling as Fictions								SCIENCE & EDUCATION				21	10			1461	1473		10.1007/s11191-012-9439-7			OCT 2012	2012	In this paper it is argued that virtual processes are dispensable fictions. The argument proceeds by a comparison with the phenomenon of quantum tunnelling. Building on an analysis of L,vy-Leblond and Balibar, it is argued that, although the phenomenon known as quantum tunnelling certainly occurs and is at the basis of many paradigmatic quantum effects, the implied conceptualization of it as a free particle burrowing through a potential barrier is flawed. An alpha particle, for example, does not exist as a free particle inside a uranium nucleus and then "burrow through" the massive potential barrier of the repulsive Coulomb potential: rather, it can be interpreted as existing in a bound state which gives it a corresponding (absolutely tiny, but) finite probability of appearing on the other side of the barrier. If the part of the state function representing the transmission through the barrier is conceived as representing a particle trajectory, the particle will have imaginary momentum and negative kinetic energy. A similar analysis then applies to virtual processes. For example, if (as in Hawking's conception of black hole radiation) one imagines a pair of particles created at the Schwarzschild radius, one of which drops into the black hole, at its creation that particle will have imaginary momentum and negative kinetic energy; so will the pion that is imagined as mediating the nuclear exchange force on the standard model. In each case, it is argued, the phenomenon can be understood in terms of a finite probability of transmission predicted by quantum theory, without appealing to particle trajectories. The idea that a particle "penetrates" a barrier that it does not have the energy to surmount, or that a pair of particles is "virtually" produced one on either side of the Schwarzschild radius, in defiance of energy conservation, should be discarded as unphysical.									0	0	0	0	0	0926-7220		WOS:000308859800005

J	Zhang, Yongjin								The eagle eyes the dragon in space-A critique								SPACE POLICY				29	2	SI		113	120		10.1016/j.spacepol.2013.03.002			MAY 2013	2013	China's space policy and its purpose have become an increasingly contentious subject. This paper critically examines the claims, made by Ashley Tellis, among others, that China has a space strategy decided and coordinated by the Chinese military and dedicated to defeating superior US power locally in an asymmetrical war, and that it is this military space strategy that drives China's single-minded pursuit of space science and technology and the development of China's space programme. To do so, the paper conducts two investigations: into the declining role of the Chinese military in China's foreign and security policy making and its limited influence in formulating China's grand strategy; and the other into the contingent history of China's two space programs, Shenzhou and Chang'e, which have largely been driven by civilian scientist communities, rather than the military. In so doing, I argue that the claims of China's 'military space strategy' are over-imaginative and serve a particular political purpose. The social imaginary of a threatening China produced by the US strategic gaze at China in space, I further argue, has dangerous policy implications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Oreskes, Naomi; Conway, Erik M.								The Collapse of Western Civilization: A View from the Future								DAEDALUS				142	1			40	58					WIN 2013	2013	Science fiction writers construct an imaginary future; historians attempt to reconstruct the past. Ultimately, both are seeking to understand the present. In this essay, we blend the two genres to imagine a future historian looking back on a past that is our present and (possible) future. The occasion is the tercentenary of the end of Western culture (1540 - 2073); the dilemma being addressed is how we - the children of the Enlightenment - failed to act on robust information about climate change and knowledge of the damaging events that were about to unfold. Our historian concludes that a second Dark Age had fallen on Western civilization, in which denial and self-deception, rooted in an ideological fixation on "free" markets, disabled the world's powerful nations in the face of tragedy. Moreover, the scientists who best understood the problem were hamstrung by their own cultural practices, which demanded an excessively stringent standard for accepting claims of any kind - even those involving imminent threats. Here, our future historian, living in the Second People's Republic of China, recounts the events of the Period of the Penumbra (1988 - 2073) that led to the Great Collapse and Mass Migration (2074).									6	0	2	0	6	0011-5266		WOS:000313760800004

The UK bank was the first of its type in the world, opening in 2004, and the Spanish bank used it as a role model in its own development. Both banks structure their operations in response to how their staffs imagine the publics in their nation make trust judgements about their work. Differences between the workings of each bank can be traced to differences in the collective imaginings operating at each banktermed institutional imaginaries'about how publics think. The UK bank sustains an imaginary in which distance lends legitimacy and disengagement signifies correct moral practice. It conjures a public that values a steady, safe and reliable institutionfree from potential conflict of interestabout which the less news the better. This stands in contrast to the Spanish bank that conjures a public that retains an interest in legitimate, ethical guardianship of stem cell material, but which is less worried about conflict of interest in attaining this. Instead, for the Spanish institution, engagement with science and the media through the projection of the bank as cutting edge is deemed crucial for maintaining public support.									0	0	0	0	0	0950-5431		WOS:000327369700006		
J	Welsh, Ian; Wynne, Brian								Science, Scientism and Imaginaries of Publics in the UK: Passive Objects, Incipient Threats								SCIENCE AS CULTURE				22	4	SI		540	566		10.1080/14636778.2013.764072			DEC 1 2013	2013	Two-way public engagement with science is an important modern democratic practice that paradoxically coincides with the intensifications of state surveillance and policing of publics and social movements engaging with issues involving science. This raises important questions about the contemporary anatomies of publics, and what count as legitimate expressions of public concern over scientific stakes within the knowledge economy. Implicit in the tension between inclusion and surveillance are concerns over the social meaning and authority of science amongst both scientific practitioners and publics. Bringing science and technology studies (STS) and social movement studies (SMS) into dialogue offers a means to explore the neglected ontological stakes in the framing of scientific imaginaries of publics, and public imaginaries of science. Post-WWII UK science-publics relations have emerged in three significant modalities, with publics imagined: as passive non-entities, circa 1950-1990 (continuing); as incipient threats due to presumed deficits in their grasp of science 1990-2000 (continuing); and, since circa 2000, as politicised threats requiring state control. Each modality is shaped by elite denial of the normative commitments embedded within science as surrogate politicsscientism. In each mode, scientistic elite emphasis on epistemic issues forecloses engagement with broader public meanings expressing legitimate normative and ontological differences. Fusing the more epistemic focus of STS with SMS's emphasis on meaning and democratic process offers a route to deeper democratic forms of public engagement with what is called science, which would also precipitate more accountability in elite discourses around science and technology.									1	0	0	0	1	0950-5431		WOS:000327369700008

The field is rapidly growing and being widely promoted, attracting attention in diverse arenas. These include those of the social sciences, where some researchers have been encouraged by the resonance between imaginaries of development within epigenetics and social theory. Yet, sustained attention from science and technology studies (STS) scholars to epigenetics and the praxis it propels has been lacking. In this article, we reflexively consider some of the ways in which epigenetics is being constructed as an area of biomedical novelty and discuss the content and logics underlying the ambivalent promises being made by scientists working in this area. We then reflect on the scope, limits and future of engagements between epigenetics and the social sciences. Our discussion is situated within wider literatures on biomedicine and society, the politics of interventionist STS, and on the problems of caseness within empirical social science.									3	0	0	0	3	1463-6778		WOS:000327930500006

In the past, the dominant focus of science, technology and society (STS) has led to a blind spot: political understanding and engagement of policy-makers and politicians with science, which is an integral part of any public engagement. Arguably, it is bound to and emerges from what Ezrahi calls collective political imaginaries. These are necessary fictions, which are causative and performative. In crude form, they manifest themselves in short-term impact measurements of every unit of scientific activity with citizens as the fictitious ultimate beneficiaries. In the future, STS can gain from coming up with a workable definition of the public interest with a focus on the public value of science. It can investigate collective imaginaries as they emerge from interactions with new media. As necessary fictions they may hold answers we never imagined them to hold.									0	0	0	0	0	0963-6625		WOS:000329687400003	24434706

What are the political implications of this imaginary? What are the absences, the residues, the invisibilised practices and actors of technoscience's ontological politics? The paper interrogates this form of politics, argues for the radical democratisation of technoscience and explores how it is possible to pose questions of justice without reducing the material to the social. It concludes with a discussion of the idea of crafting alternative ontologies as commitment to a material organisation of justice.									1	0	0	0	1	0269-1728		WOS:000343205900006		
J	Taylor-Alexander, Samuel								Bioethics in the Making: "Ideal Patients" and the Beginnings of Face Transplant Surgery in Mexico								SCIENCE AS CULTURE				23	1			27	50		10.1080/09505431.2013.789843			JAN 2 2014	2014	Medical teams around the world are increasingly gaining ethical clearance to utilise face transplant surgery as a reconstructive surgical procedure. Analysis of the beginnings of the operation in Mexico vis-a-vis the early uptake of the procedure in France reveals that this controversial experimental medical field has become loaded with national significance. The primary issue of dispute has been the dependence on life-threatening immunosuppressant therapy in a procedure that treats otherwise biologically healthy people. Attempts to resolve related debate has resulted in the emergence of what my interlocutors refer to as an ideal patient, a person whose particular state of health and suffering render them operable within the current biomedical constraints. Drawing together the idiom of coproduction with the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries shows how this imagined patient category was refracted and stabilised as it entered into the Mexican context whilst producing patients and surgical experts as particular types of bioethical subjects. The flexibility and normative value of the ideal patient mobilises and is mobilised by surgeons, who themselves emerge as national bioethical subjects responsible for saving the face of nations in the midst of broader changes surrounding how State's should respond to medical advancement.									0	0	0	0	0	0950-5431		WOS:000329776700002

Bruno served as a queer beast in the anthropogenic landscape where he challenged boundaries of what is permissible, and normal. By refusing to honor borders and cultural norms, he disrupted our human sense of control of the landscape. In response to Bruno's unruly presence, humans in turn appropriated him, fixed him as a cipher to fill with their own constructs of wildness and animality, and then deployed those cultural articulations. Performing a critical visual analysis, this paper explores how the anxiety Bruno evoked fixed his queer, hirsute frame as a taxidermied cipher representing discipline, fetishization, and a critique of power. Bruno became an imaginary wild whose presence rhetorically queered the geographical and political landscape.									0	0	0	0	0	1752-4032		WOS:000333655100006		
J	Olarte Sierra, Maria Fernanda; Del Castillo Hernandez, Adriana Diaz								We Are All the Same, We All Are Mestizos': Imagined Populations and Nations in Genetics Research in Colombia								SCIENCE AS CULTURE				23	2			226	252		10.1080/09505431.2013.838214			APR 3 2014	2014	In Colombia, as in other Latin American countries, current population genetics research is based on the understanding that Colombians constitute a mestizo nation, given the admixture process that took place between Africans, Amerindians, and Europeans during colonial times. The mestizo is a pervasive category used by geneticists to conduct, organise, and publish research studies that deal with the continent's peopling process and the genetic makeup of its contemporary population(s). It is also the dominant imaginary for the Colombian population and a key nation-building ideology. By tracing how this category moves and is used across four Colombian genetics laboratories, it is possible to discern that despite its apparently clear-cut boundaries, the mestizo is contingent, contested, and flexible, allowing for multiple understandings and usages. This flexibility and multiplicity are visible in the quantification of genetic ancestry, the divisions of geographical location, and the understanding of gender. Such understandings allow one to think about a homogeneous nation (inclusive) that is simultaneously heterogeneous (exclusive); they provide multiple but not necessarily contradictory possibilities of being mestizo, allowing the coexistence of images of the nation that could otherwise seem contradictory; and they permit navigation around contested terms such as race, while simultaneously thinking of mixed races or racialised individuals. Finally, these flexible and multiple constructions of the mestizo (re)produce various subjects as other', whether they are women, the Indigenous, the black/dark, or the poor.									1	0	0	0	1	0950-5431		WOS:000335212200004

We take as our model (in)organism Lucy the Robot Orangutan', roboticist Steve Grand's project to create an artificial life form with a mind of its own. One aspect of Lucy's figuration by Grand, we argue, which ties her to Haraway's analysis of the primate, is of the robot as a model for animal, and more specifically (or aspirationally) human, cognition. We follow the trope of model organism' as it is under discussion within science and technology studies and as an ironic descriptor for our own interest in Lucy as an entity/project through which to illuminate figurations within robotics more widely. Primate and robot together are forms of natureculture that help to clarify how the categories of animal and machine are entangled, while making explicit investments in their differences from one another, and from the third category of the human. We conclude, again following Haraway, by imagining what other possibilities there might be for figuring humans, robots, and their relations if we escape the reiterative imaginary of the robot as proxy for becoming human.									1	0	0	0	1	0306-3127		WOS:000336332200001	25051585

As such, it is generally assumed to have revealed the drawbacks of research in scientifically and ethically less-developed societies. Such thinking ignores the history, sophistication, and distinctive features of the public debate over hESC research in South Korea. Disputes over the social and ethical implications of hESC research had taken place for some time before the scandal erupted. Moreover, unlike in some other countries, where resistance to hESC research was prompted by religious conservatives, the most serious critique of the country's rapid move into the field came from progressive social movement activists-including feminists and environmentalists. These activists were, in fact, part of the non-governmental organization coalition to impose stricter social controls on biotechnology. This campaign was motivated by broader political and social concerns beyond specific biosafety or bioethical issues. The activists involved in the coalition feared that the capitalist-developmentalist drive toward biotechnology would threaten the public interest and democracy, and ultimately block South Korea's road to becoming a democratic nation founded on the values of social justice, equality, participation, and sustainability. In contesting South Korea's prevailing approaches to hESC research, they challenged, albeit unsuccessfully, the dominant 'national sociotechnical imaginary' that articulates the role of science and technology in relation to the future survival and well-being of the nation primarily in terms of its industrial competitiveness.									1	0	0	0	1	0950-5431		WOS:000340996900001		
J	Grabowski, D.; Rasmussen, K. K.								Adolescents' health identities: A qualitative and theoretical study of health education courses								SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE				120				67	75		10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.09.011			NOV 2014	2014	In this paper we highlight the role of health identity in health education for adolescents. In school-based approaches to health education, it is often difficult to present health information and health communication in ways that make sense and appeal to adolescents. The concept of health identity has the potential of providing an analytical framework as well as practical recommendations for these issues and problem areas. The paper reports on an empirical study of elements of health identity in the context of health courses for adolescents using interview data, observation studies and a theoretical construction focussing on self-observation, horizons of significance, expectational structures and social imaginaries. We present our findings in four main themes: 1) Adolescents' health identities are observed and developed when things matter, 2) Adolescents' health identities are observed and developed in relational contexts, 3) Adolescents' health identities are developed on the basis of observations of past, present and future health and 4) Adolescents' health identities are clearly defined. The paper provides health practitioners with important knowledge about why and how health-educational approaches should focus on health identity in order to provide conditions that create a significant health educating effect for all adolescents not just for those who are already healthy.

J	Pollock, Anne								Places of pharmaceutical knowledge-making: Global health, postcolonial science, and hope in South African drug discovery								SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE				44	6			848	873		10.1177/0306312714543285			DEC 2014	2014	This article draws on ethnographic research at iThemba Pharmaceuticals, a small South African startup pharmaceutical company with an elite international scientific board. The word iThemba' is Zulu for hope', and so far drug discovery at the company has been essentially aspirational rather than actual. Yet this particular place provides an entry point for exploring how the location of the scientific knowledge component of pharmaceuticals - rather than their production, licensing, or distribution - matters. The article explores why it matters for those interested in global health and postcolonial science, and why it matters for the scientists themselves. Consideration of this case illuminates limitations of global health frameworks that implicitly posit rich countries as the unique site of knowledge production, and thus as the source of unidirectional knowledge flows. It also provides a concrete example for consideration of the contexts and practices of postcolonial science, its constraints, and its promise. Although the world is not easily bifurcated, it still matters who makes knowledge and where.									0	0	0	0	0	0306-3127		WOS:000345573700003	25608441
