Abstract = {{In the 1950s, Catholic thought was challenged by a ``quarrel of sacred
   art.{''} Radical dogmatic positions confronted each other around the
   question of the ``regeneration{''} of religious art and the position of
   the church faced with the artistic evolutions of the 20(th) century,
   and especially the appearance of abstract art. A group of Benedictine
   monks seized upon the occasion of this uncertainty to propose an
   enlightened approach, defined in an art journal, and then in a
   veritable editorial adventure, the launching of Zodiaque, whose
   original function was to provide, as a source of inspiration to
   contemporary artists the models offered by romanesque art. This would
   provide the source that their speculative search could trust. They
   would find a base in this art, which the director of publications, Dom
   Angelico Surchamp, considered more authentic.
   From an artistic and dogmatic engagement, the Editions Zodiaque
   gradually became a highly successful editor of fine arts publications.
   Their approach, both systematic and synthetic of the sites they
   proposed, offered an extremely original synoptic vision for a period
   which up to then had only been known to the average person, but also to
   art historians, through the major masterpieces, or through the most
   easily accessible sites.
   The analysis of the history of these publications provides insight into
   the role played by photography in the diffusion and in the transmission
   of knowledge in art history, in the constitution of Andre Malraux's
   ``imaginary museum.{''} Malraux was a staunch supporter of these
   publications, answer to his appeal.}},

   International Relations theorist}},
Journal = {{MILLENNIUM-JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{117-133}},
Abstract = {{This essay begins by expressing a concern with the much-too-easy
   retrieval of empire in the writings of many commentators across the
   political spectrum. I suggest, via a reading of Edward Said as an
   International Relations theorist, that part of our failing, as scholars
   of the global, to prevent such a resurrection lies in a discipline too
   focused on depoliticized `technocratic expertise' and overly
   `nationalistic' in its orientation. What Edward Said has to offer IR
   scholars, I argue, is a `global intellectual posture' - a sensibility
   that involves a critical but hospitable awareness of an inhabited and
   co-habited world and an intellectual approach that provides a rigorous
   and more complete approach to `the global'. Said's thoughts on humanism
   help situate the most marginal and underrepresented bodies firmly and
   concretely into the center of an IR that that has been mostly
   `great-power' focused in the questions and issues it attends to. Said's
   discussions of `contrapuntality' provides a method that enables the
   study of simultaneous and mutually constitutive (of East and West,
   North and South) histories against the linear, developmentalist (from
   Westphalia to Globalization) historical narratives inherited by most IR
   scholars. Understanding our contemporary international relations as a
   product of a history of cultural encounters (in which colonialism
   played a key part) would make it possible, for students and scholars of
   IR, to articulate a global imaginary that is sensitive to both power
   and difference.}},

Journal = {{SPATIAL VISION}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{3-18}},
Abstract = {{Piranesi was an extraordinarily talented artist who came to be
   considered the best known engraver and etcher of the 18th century. He
   spent his lifetime recording the magnificent buildings and ruins of
   ancient Rome. In his earlier work, he developed architectural fantasies
   and dark visions of imaginary prisons, the Carceri d'Invenzione
   (Imaginary Prisons), which have fascinated people ever since they first
   appeared. They also made an impact in later artistic and literary
   contexts.
   Today they are considered the best expression of bewilderment, of the
   world's massive oppression of man. How did Piranesi generate such a
   powerful source of meaning? I have reviewed a number of contributions
   by art essayists in the search for what lies behind the fascination of
   the `Carceri'. Analysis of these texts provides a rich set of aesthetic
   and psychological attributes as well as detailed indications of where
   to seek the source of the meanings. I suggest here a fruitful
   integration of this analysis, developed by considering various
   particular perceptual and geometric cues. I discuss three possible
   sources of meaning: the combination of architectural elements out of
   proportion; the difficulty of building a unitary space; and the `bottom
   perspective' that gives rise to a sensation of floating.}},

Title = {{The donor, the father, and the imaginary constitution of the family:
   Parents' constructions in the case of donor insemination}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{301-314}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Current international policy trends in the field of medically assisted
   conception are moving towards increased openness of information
   regarding the nature of conception where donated gametes are involved.
   In the case of donor insemination this means that the donor is no
   longer anonymous, offspring have the right to access information about
   the donor's identity, and parents are encouraged to tell children the
   nature of their donor-assisted conception. Until recently, however, the
   practice of donor insemination has tended to create the conditions for
   ignoring, or erasing, the existence of the donor as the provider of the
   gametes. Changing policy creates numerous challenges to this erasure,
   and to traditional conceptualisations of the father. This research is
   based on analysis of the narratives of a group of 41 New Zealand
   couples who conceived children with the assistance of donor
   insemination 15-18 years prior. This article focuses on their talk
   about the donor. The parents' negation of the donor supports the
   normative formation of `family', and is in turn supported by an
   instrumental and de-personalising discourse in relation to the donor. A
   tension is created within the parents' talk whereby donors are negated
   and yet simultaneously appear as persons. We explore this discursive
   construction, suggesting that a new framework for thinking about
   donated gametes and the role of the donor is influencing parents'
   narrations and understandings of family. We discuss these influences
   and examine their implications, particularly with respect to a
   separation of the bio-genetic from the social-environmental. (c) 2007

Abstract = {{We apply the Beck model, developed for turbulent systems that exhibit
   scaling properties, to stock markets. Our study reveals that the Beck
   model elucidates the properties of stock market returns and is
   applicable to practical use such as the Value-at-Risk estimation and
   the portfolio analysis. We perform empirical analysis with
   daily/intraday data of the S\&P500 index return and find that the
   volatility fluctuation of real markets is well-consistent with the
   assumptions of the Beck model: The volatility fluctuates at a much
   larger time scale than the return itself and the inverse of variance,
   or ``inverse temperature{''}, beta obeys Gamma-distribution. As
   predicted by the Beck model, the distribution of returns is well-fitted
   by q-Gaussian distribution of Tsallis statistics. The evaluation method
   of Value-at-Risk (VaR), one of the most significant indicators in risk
   management, is studied for q-Gaussian distribution. Our proposed method
   enables the VaR evaluation in consideration of tail risk, which is
   underestimated by the variance-covariance method. A framework of
   portfolio risk assessment under the existence of tail risk is
   considered. We propose a multi-asset model with a single volatility
   fluctuation shared by all assets, named the single beta model, and
   empirically examine the agreement between the model and an imaginary
   portfolio with Dow Jones indices. It turns out that the single P model
   gives good approximation to portfolios composed of the assets with
   non-Gaussian and correlated returns. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights

   processes, we simulate the imaginary paths of the nominal interest
   rate, producer price index inflation rate and output if the central
   bank has not adopted an inflation targeting policy. This simulation
   shows that the variances of output and the inflation rate under a
   noninflation targeting regime are larger than those under the actual
   inflation targeting regime. We also calculate social loss, as defined

Abstract = {{The article explores how enlargement of the European Union has affected
   the development of the European public sphere. At the initial stage of
   enlargement, communication between the `old' and `new' democracies was
   hampered by prejudice and estrangement from the western side and
   illusionary expectations from the eastern side. Different historical
   experiences after the Second World War had raised barriers to mutual
   understanding. While experiences of `building capitalism' brought
   post-Communist nations closer to the values of the European welfare
   society, the eastwards enlargement at the same time strengthened the
   influence of identity politics among the `old' democracies of Europe.
   As a result, there is now less difference between the `old' and `new'
   members of the EU than was expected at the beginning of the enlargement
   process. The new members of the EU are even more interested in the
   development of the European public sphere than are many people in the
   West, because they see in this process their chance to be included in
   the European communication space as equal members. In order to reach
   this goal, the process of `horizontal integration' between national

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{349-371}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study examines two writers, Michel Rio and Michel Houellebecq, who
   have encountered opposite fortunes among the public and critics.
   However, they share numerous writing practices associated with
   postmodernism that include mixing literary forms, integrating
   epistemological discourses, doubling characters, avoidance of
   meta-narratives, and destabilizing interpretation through irony,
   fractured perspectives and the parodic recycling of popular genres such
   as detective fiction and eroticism. Moreover, both display putatively
   reactionary elements in their fiction: Houellebecq quite explicitly,
   Rio through his sexual and political imaginary (especially in the
   Francis Malone `enquetes'). We conclude that both writers are indeed
   rooted in reactionary habits of thought, but Rio's practices place him
   in the camp of modernism (hierarchy of epistemologies, elitist
   stereotyping, scientism), while Houellebecq falls among the
   postmodernists (neutralizing voices of authority, erasing high/low

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper explores space as the object of mobilization (rather than
   focusing on space as resource or constraint, or on the spatial
   configuration of actors within the organizational structure of a
   movement). In the context of state-restructuring processes, it is
   argued that new political spaces result not only from social movement
   activities (as in the drive for `free spaces'), but also in a dynamic
   interaction between state and civil society actors. The author asks
   what it takes to create a new, effective, and significant political
   space. Three elements are explored empirically and theoretically: the
   production of allegiance and legitimacy through spatial imaginaries,
   the instrumentalization of spatial practices and of the political
   culture, and the strategic use of spatial tools. In light of the case
   of Toronto, where a new regional political space eased the
   normalization of neoliberalism, it is concluded that new political
   spaces create the conditions for political exchange, but do not
   guarantee emancipation, democracy, and justice. Overall, the author's
   aim is to discuss the concept of political space and the analytical
   advantages provided by its openness to fluidity, uncertainties,
   uninstitutionalized interactions, and various forms of rationalities
   (imaginaries, everyday practices, as well as strategic calculation) in
   the state-restructuring and rescaling debate.}},

   celebration of America's cultural leadership and accomplishment since
   its `discovery' by Christopher Columbus in 1492. The Johnson family

   most strongly in seeking for problem-based information. The major

   Typically, information pathways consisted of the use of 3-4 sources. On
   average, human and networked sources were favored in the early phases
   of information seeking. Printed media such as magazines and

Abstract = {{This article examines the idea of North in Aritha van Herk's (1990)
   Places Far From Ellesmere, a feminist rereading of Anna Karenin that is
   also an exploration of place-Ellesmere Island-and of gender, identity
   and belonging. I situate my reading of Ellesmere firstly within
   feminist literary theory focusing on the concept of intertextuality and
   on the implications of the concept, from the perspective of feminist
   theorists, for the acts Of writing and reading. I further contextualise
   van Herk's work by outlining the growing sensitivity to the
   complexities of writing Canadian space in Canadian literary criticism.
   The focus then shifts to Ellesmere, beginning with an investigation of
   van Herk's representational practices and philosophies, which are
   organised around a critique of the relationship between writing, gender
   and power. I argue that van Herk's insistence upon the power of
   feminist textual rereadings, an insistence that results from her
   aversion to authority, critically shapes her geographical imaginary,
   and her understanding of North. By extending the text and thereby the
   practice of reading to geography, van Herk makes possible a feminist
   representation or rereading of the North that simultaneously contests
   the conventions of literature, of place and of gender. Ultimately, I
   argue that it is van Herk's commitment to investigate the processes of
   representation in which she is engaged that makes her representation of
   the North such a valuable text for feminist and literary geographers.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a Zoharic story found in one manuscript only-ms.
   Vatican 206. The focal point of this story is the question whether in
   order to cleave to God while walking, one should make use of the
   homiletical discourse, which naturally involves a dialogue with one's
   walking partner, or whether one should focus one's heart and will on
   God in utter silence. Rabbi Yose represents the group consensus (
   widely described in the printed edition of the Zohar) as he expects
   Rabbi Abba to converse with him about matters of Torah; Rabbi Abba, on
   the other hand, represents ideas novel to that circle, probably under
   the influence of contemporary spiritualist trends. The story is very
   succinct, but its comparison to other Zoharic texts and the attention
   to the strong emotions alluded to between the lines reveal a rich plot.
   It seems that the fellows of the historical Zohar circle found
   themselves at a spiritual crossroads-one of them was attempting to
   undermine their dominant spiritual system and replace it with a more
   introverted one. It seems, however, that the fact that this story was
   excluded from the Zoharic corpus-it only appears in one
   manuscript-shows that the positive ending to this imaginary story,
   whereby Rabbi Yose silently agrees with Rabbi Abba, remains a wishful
   thought and that this attempt at incorporating new ways into the
   circle's traditions failed.}},

   robot-assisted ADL tasks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAR 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Robotic therapy is at the forefront of stroke
   rehabilitation. The Activities of Daily Living Exercise Robot (ADLER)
   was developed to improve carryover of gains after training by combining
   the benefits of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) training (motivation
   and functional task practice with real objects), with the benefits of
   robot mediated therapy (repeatability and reliability). In combining
   these two therapy techniques, we seek to develop a new model for
   trajectory generation that will support functional movements to real
   objects during robot training. We studied natural movements to real
   objects and report on how initial reaching movements are affected by
   real objects and how these movements deviate from the straight line
   paths predicted by the minimum jerk model, typically used to generate
   trajectories in robot training environments. We highlight key issues
   that to be considered in modelling natural trajectories.
   Methods: Movement data was collected as eight normal subjects completed
   ADLs such as drinking and eating. Three conditions were considered:
   object absent, imagined, and present. This data was compared to
   predicted trajectories generated from implementing the minimum jerk
   model. The deviations in both the plane of the table (XY) and the
   saggital plane of torso (XZ) were examined for both reaches to a cup
   and to a spoon. Velocity profiles and curvature were also quantified
   for all trajectories.
   Results: We hypothesized that movements performed with functional task
   constraints and objects would deviate from the minimum jerk trajectory
   model more than those performed under imaginary or object absent
   conditions. Trajectory deviations from the predicted minimum jerk model
   for these reaches were shown to depend on three variables: object
   presence, object orientation, and plane of movement. When subjects
   completed the cup reach their movements were more curved than for the
   spoon reach. The object present condition for the cup reach showed more
   curvature than in the object imagined and absent conditions. Curvature
   in the XZ plane of movement was greater than curvature in the XY plane
   for all movements.
   Conclusion: The implemented minimum jerk trajectory model was not
   adequate for generating functional trajectories for these ADLs. The
   deviations caused by object affordance and functional task constraints
   must be accounted for in order to allow subjects to perform functional
   task training in robotic therapy environments. The major differences
   that we have highlighted include trajectory dependence on: object
   presence, object orientation, and the plane of movement. With the
   ability to practice ADLs on the ADLER environment we hope to provide
   patients with a therapy paradigm that will produce optimal results and
   recovery.}},

   anthropological practice. It is argued that anthropologists are still
   answering a `call of the unknown' by which to expand the horizon of the
   modern social imaginary. The vehicle of this discussion is found in
   early Arctic ethnography, not least in the works of (Danish) Knud
   Rasmussen. It is shown how ancient images of the far northern world and
   its people persistently infiltrated the ethnographic descriptions, and
   how the `unknown' is perceived through `known' images. Nevertheless,
   the relationship between the known and the unknown is far from stable,
   because new horizons open and close in the process of understanding and
   description. This is still the case, and the result is a fluid field of
   knowledge that serves as a repository of doubt about canonical
   categories.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Previous research has reported a link between imaginary
   companions (ICs) in middle childhood and the perception of verbal
   material in ambiguous auditory stimuli. These findings have been
   interpreted in terms of commonalities in the cognitive processes
   underlying children's engagement with lCs and adults' reporting of
   imaginary verbal experiences such as auditory verbal hallucinations.
   The aim of the present study was to examine these relations using
   improved methodology and a younger sample of children for whom
   engagement with ICs would be expected to be particularly salient.
   Method: Data on young children's (age range: 4-8 years) reporting of
   ICs were gathered in two studies (total N = 80). Responses to ambiguous
   auditory stimuli were investigated using the new Jumbled Speech task,
   which measures participants' likelihood of perceiving words in
   meaningless but speech-like auditory stimuli. Results: Reporting
   hearing words in the Jumbled Speech task was associated with having a
   parentally corroborated IC. Hearing words on the task and having an IC
   were unrelated to age, gender, verbal ability, and understanding of the
   stream of consciousness. Conclusions: Findings are consistent with the
   hypothesis that engaging with ICs is one aspect of a general
   susceptibility to imaginary verbal experiences. We consider the
   implications for the assumption of continuity in psychopathological
   experiences between childhood and adulthood.}},

Abstract = {{On the basis of return migration of Christians to Mardin ( Turkey) and
   the location of migrants in Essen's ( Germany) nomination for the
   European Capital of Culture, this article focuses on the interface
   between urban restructuration, cultural diversity and migrant
   incorporation in the context of neo-liberal globalization. Despite the
   growing literature on the new role of culture in urban economics, scant
   attention has been given to the place of immigrants/returnees in urban
   dynamics and in the repositioning struggle between cities within and
   across border. This article aims to bring together the field of
   (transnational) migration and studies on culture in scalar politics. It
   argues that the structural changes taking place in the cities of
   migrants' departure and settlement shape the nature of migrant
   incorporation and transnationalism, the narratives about migrants'
   place in urban development, and the venues of translating cultural
   diversity into a competitive advantage in scalar politics. On the basis
   of the role migrants/returnees play in the involvement of supranational
   actors like the EU in Mardin and Essen in the prospects of urban
   development, this article draws attention to the impact of
   supranational actors in shaping territorial inequalities, as well as
   the local trajectories of urban politics. Finally, it raises questions
   about special European dynamics in changing imaginaries and
   topographies of cultural diversity in Europe, which go beyond

Abstract = {{Edgar Allan Poe partakes of a social imaginary pursuing a single,

   examine how Poe, rather than following the predominantly utopian,
   utilitarian, and self-affirming teleologies of many such contemporary
   discourses ( mesmerism, spiritualism, etc.), pictures instead the
   unsettling implications for human ontology consequent upon the idea
   that persons are less autonomous or sovereign entities than mutable
   effects of external, inhuman forces. Routing my discussion through a
   critical reading of Martin Heidegger's Being and Time, I argue that
   Poe's cosmological poem-essay Eureka and much of his short fiction
   including ``Ligeia{''} and ``The Fall of the House of Usher{''} -
   present a model of the universe and of the natural world that actively
   erodes the distinctions separating humanity from its physical
   environment, indeed that finally refuses the differentiation of subject
   and object altogether. My essay provides a brief genealogy for this
   macabre literalization of contemporary theories of the universe in
   Poe's writing and explores the implications that it has for a critical
   tradition ( psychoanalytic, deconstructive, ideological) largely
   invested in the selves rather than the surroundings of Poe's tales.}},

   ultimately show how poetry itseif animates a moment which is both
   inside and outside of time, resisting the pressure of reality. Morike's
   poetry is especially a work of memory and commemoration; this can be
   seen in poems about artefacts (Auf eine Lampe) or natural phenomena

   the blurring of the possible and the impossible. A differently

Journal = {{OXFORD GERMAN STUDIES}},

Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{60-75}},
Abstract = {{Eduard Morike's keen interest in palaeontology is reflected in two
   poems which both address changing conceptions of natural time and their
   impact on religion, memory and imagination in the nineteenth century.
   Within the guise of a light-hearted Gelegenheitsgedicht, Morike's `Der
   Petrefaktensammler' explores the gulf between geological theories and
   human experience; the speaker's enjoyment of nature is curtailed by
   fossils acting as reminders of the relative brevity of human life. This
   realisation is replayed within a more allegorical context in Morike's
   poem `Gottliche Reminiscenz'. Here a fossil features as the centrepiece
   of an imaginary painting of the young Christ which brings together the
   realms of religion and science not as conflicting paradigms but as two
   models of explanation which can still be harmonised. Despite their
   apparent differences, then, the article argues that `Der
   Petrefaktensammler' and `Gottliche Reminiscenz' provide complementary
   insights into Morike's mobilisation of palaeontology as a tool of his

Abstract = {{The Indian state, when it announced the opening of its borders-physical
   and imaginary - to globalisation, also embraced new digital
   technologies of telecommunication and transportation in its attempt to
   reconfigure itself as a global player in the world market. The
   neo-liberal economic policies and the restructuring of the State had
   immediate and far reaching impact on the question of citizenship. The
   technologised State posited the need for a technosocial subject - a
   subject that was not only a consumer/user of technology but also
   subject to the different technological networks instituted towards a
   new-modernism. The fetishisation of such a technosocial subject entails
   a new regime of discipline and containment that produces certain
   glorified non-legal subject positions which challenge the efforts of
   the State to create a homogeneous sanitised cyberscape. This paper is
   an attempt to examine the production of illegalities with reference to

   which citizenships are enacted, in the specific context of contemporary
   India. Looking at one incident each, of cyber-pornography and

   degrees, eccentricity congruent to 5.5 degrees). The proportion of
   correctly reported letters was a strictly increasing, decelerating
   function of the spatial separation between the letters for
   center-to-center separations ranging from less than 2 degrees to more
   than 10 degrees of visual angle. Experiment 2 yielded similar results
   with triples of letters. Experiment 3 showed that accuracy increased
   with spatial separation for report of two short words, and Experiment 4

Abstract = {{This paper describes the recent development of identity and community

   particular, it addresses the question of how these emerging forms of

   understand the threat of HIV and make concrete decisions about sexual
   risk and safety.
   Among the chief tactics used by gay men in China to forge identity and
   community involves appropriating and adapting elements from dominant
   discourses of the Party-State and the mass media. This strategy has
   opened up spaces within which gay men can claim ``cultural
   citizenship{''} in a society in which they have been heretofore
   marginalized. At the same time, this strategy also implicated in the
   formation of attitudes and social practices that potentially increase

Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{18-27}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to gain more insight into the mechanisms
   underlying motor imagery (MI). While there is ample evidence that motor
   performance and MI share common central neural mechanisms, the question
   whether MI is accompanied by subliminal electromyographic (EMG)
   activity remained unsolved. Thirty right-handed volunteers were asked
   to lift or to imagine lifting a weighted dumbbell using different types
   of muscle contraction, i.e. heavy concentric, light concentric,
   isometric and eccentric contractions. EMG activity from 9 muscles of
   the dominant arm (agonist, antagonist, synergist and fixator muscles)
   was monitored. Autonomic nervous system responses were also recorded on
   the non-dominant hand, thus attesting mental activity at the peripheral
   level. A significant increased pattern of EMG activity was recorded in
   all muscles during MI, when compared to the rest condition, while the
   goniometric data did not reveal any movement. Although being
   subliminal, the magnitude of this activation was found to be correlated
   to the mental effort required to lift a weight mentally, as more EMG
   activity was recorded during imaginary lifting of heavy than light
   concentric contractions. When considering the different types of
   contraction, our results provided evidence of selective changes in EMG
   activity. Especially, the imagined eccentric condition elicited a
   significant weaker muscular activity than all other conditions. In
   addition. the changes in the EMG pattern mirrored those usually
   observed during physical movement. These findings support the
   hypotheses of a selective effect of MI at the level of muscular
   activity and of incomplete inhibition of the motor command during MI.

Abstract = {{Through the process of decontextualization, the behaviours and objects
   used in children's pretence become increasingly detached from their
   real-life contexts and uses (Flavell, 1985). However, whilst
   age-related changes in children's pretence have been reasonably well
   documented, the relationship between the decontextualization of form
   and function has yet to be established and the relationship between
   pretence using substitute objects and pretence without substitute
   objects remains unclear. To address these issues, 3-8-year-old
   typically developing children (N = 84) were shown a series of pretend
   actions, like writing, enacted at various levels of
   decontextualization. Children's understanding of each action was
   assessed. The results revealed three main findings. First, form and
   function are both equally important in children's comprehension of
   object substitution pretence. Second, children find actions enacted
   using substitute objects that are similar to the referent in terms of
   both their form and function easier to interpret than those performed
   using decontextualized props - including body-part-as-object (BPO) and
   imaginary object (10) gestures - regardless of age. Finally, BPO and 10
   gestures are of equal complexity and children 5 years and above
   correctly interpret these gestures more readily than actions involving
   substitute objects that share no similarity with the referent. These
   findings are discussed in relation to dual and triune representation
   problems (DeLoache, 1995; Tomasello, Striano, \& Rochat, 1999).}},

Abstract = {{In three spatial precuing experiments, we demonstrate attentional
   capture by an intersection that occurs (1) between two lines that are
   not part of an enclosed object, and (2) between a line in the cuing
   array that is not physically present during target search and the
   invisible circumference of a perceptual circle formed by the elements
   in the target array. This capture effect conceptually replicates Cole,
   Gellatly, and Blurton's (2001) corner enhancement effect, in which
   responses are faster for targets presented near an object's corners
   rather than along its straight edges. However, it extends that effect
   by showing that it occurs even when the intersection is not part of an
   enclosed object and is not physically present during target search.
   More important, our capture effect occurred even though the target's
   position was not designated by a perceptually distinctive feature and
   was not predicted by the intersection's position. Thus, it seems that a
   line intersection-whether it be real or imaginary-automatically
   captures visual-spatial attention, contrary to Folk, Remington, and
   Johnston's (1992) and Gibson and Kelsey's (1998) views that such an
   involuntary capture of spatial attention is contingent on attentional

Abstract = {{This paper aims to determine where the Hungarian civil service system

   Secondly, practice is examined relying on available statistical and
   survey data. The author argues that, contrary to the conclusions of
   most of scholarly publications, the Hungarian Law is a pseudo-merit
   system law, not in fact preventing the prevalence of a spoils system.
   Practice generally reveals, however, features of a modestly politicized
   system with signs of increasing professionalization. The last two

   surprising findings and whether the findings for the Hungarian civil
   service may be generalized to some or most of the Central and East

   representations of real or imaginary objects on a small or large scale
   (from modeling of molecular structures to buildings, streets, and

   considered in the early 1990s, when it was suggested that VR technology
   could provide powerful learning environments not available through
   other means (M. Bricken, 1991). A growing VR research community has
   since sought to examine the benefits of using this technology in
   mainstream and special needs education, as well as other learning
   environments. This article first presents a brief description of VR
   technology and its use in teaching and learning. VR can be used as a
   tool for communication, as a medium through which individuals express
   ideas, and for learning about communication, through guided training
   and rehearsal in simulated social scenarios. This article concentrates
   on the latter application and presents 4 research projects conducted by
   the Virtual Reality Applications Research Team and associated
   colleagues in special needs education since 1991. These projects

Abstract = {{This article analyses four very popular early Victorian travelogues to
   the Levant. Written by Alexander Kinglake, Eliot Warburton, William
   Thackeray and Robert Curzon, these travelogues represent the rise of a
   sub-genre of travel literature which is particularly interesting for
   debates concerning Orientalism in the nineteenth century. At a time,
   when technocratic travel writing was gaining currency, these
   travelogues prominently featured a ludic attitude towards Levantine
   travel. Travel provided an opportunity for an imaginary reconstruction
   of the carnivalesque world of masquerades and fairs which was being
   thoroughly marginalized at home. The argument of the article is based
   on a Bakhtinian reading indebted to the work of Peter Stallybrass and
   Allon White. It suggests that the language and imagery of these
   travelogues was influenced by specific developments in the language of
   class within Britain. Focusing on London, it ties this language to
   concrete socio-economic trends affecting the lives of the middle

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{An object hidden among distractors can be found more efficiently if
   previously searched locations are not reinspected. The
   inhibition-of-return (IOR) phenomenon indexes the tendency to avoid
   reinspections. Two accounts of IOR, that it is due to inhibition and
   that it is due to expectation, are generally regarded as incompatible.
   The relevant evidence to date, however, has been indirect: Inhibition
   or expectation has been inferred from response times or similar
   indirect measures. This article reports the first direct measure of
   IOR, obtained by asking observers to predict the location of the next
   target in a display containing eight possible locations on an imaginary
   circle. On any given trial, the previously cued location was chosen
   less frequently (impairment) - and the opposite location was chosen

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1-20}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Scholarly discussion has treated the account of the state of nature
   which Locke presents in his Second Treatise as neither an hypothesis
   nor a description but rather as a fiction. John Dunn, for example,
   claims that it is a `theoretical analysis of the fundamental relations
   of right and duty which obtain between human beings, relations which
   are logically prior to the particular historical situations in which
   all actual human beings always in fact find themselves'. Here Dunn
   presents a misleading account of Locke's argument, presumably, as the
   title of his paper suggests, in order to mount an argument of his own
   about the `political relevance' of Locke's work to a time when no one
   takes seriously the early modern idea of the state of nature. However,
   this article also has a more serious concern. I argue that the
   representation of the state of nature as a merely imaginary,
   `theoretical analysis' of social relations obscures the significance of
   the early modern idea of a state of nature, not only for the work of
   Locke and his near contemporaries, but also, more importantly, for the
   broader development of western social and political thought. The idea
   of an original condition of freedom and equality played a central role
   in Locke's argument, serving as a means both to undermine the view that
   humans were born into a natural condition of subjection to the rule of
   others and to Justify European expropriation of land in the Americas.
   It also represented one end of a developmental continuum, running from
   the original, most primitive, condition of humanity through to the
   societies of contemporary western Europe, which was thought to
   encompass all sections of humanity. While the idea of an original
   asocial condition on which this continuum was based was later brought
   into question, a closely related developmental framework nevertheless
   informed later movements in history and the social sciences. After
   being abandoned in its original form, this category was finally revived
   in 20th-century political theory, this time precisely in the form that
   Dunn mistakenly ascribes to Locke. The article concludes by speculating
   on the relationship between these normative and empirical perspectives
   on the state of nature.}},

Abstract = {{This essay addresses the link between sex trafficking and European

   the production of images, it points to the highly symbolic and

   bodies dispayed in the campaigns indicates that the use of victimizing

   Wounded and dead women's bodies are read as attempts to stabilize the
   current political and social transformations in Europe by capturing
   women within the highly immobile boundaries of the sign ` Woman'. The
   essay suggests that the representation of violence is thus violent
   itself since it confirms the stereotypes about eastern European women,
   equates the feminine with the passive object, severs the body from its
   materiality and from the historical context in which trafficking
   occurs, and finally confines women within the highly disabling symbolic

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Approaching struggles for political representation through a
   perspective of `methodological transterritorialism', we seek to make
   sense of recent developments evolving around a territorialised urban
   neighbourhood. Werderau, a garden suburb founded by a mechanical
   engineering company at the beginning of the 20th century, enjoyed
   relative protection from globalising frictions and struggles until the
   `world-in-motion' suddenly penetrated the community a few years ago. We
   begin by charting the production of the bounded settlement as a site of
   alternate social ordering at a time of hyper-industrialisation and its
   imaginary role as a territorial heterotopia, symbolising order in a
   seemingly chaotic urban world. Turning to the owner's decision to sell
   the neighbourhood in 1998, we then argue that long-term inhabitants
   discursively frame the events following the decision as
   `transterritorial pollution' of their bounded community, reflected in
   the commodification of their neighbourhood and in an `invasion'of
   non-German home-owners. After discussing how longer term residents
   attempt to restabilise their identities by taking up a xenophobic
   discourse, we conclude by criticising policy-makers for responding
   solely in a territorial logic and for one-sidedly taking up the
   discourse advanced by long-term residents. Instead, we advance a
   utopian vision of the city as a worldly site where people live under
   conditions of `transcultural Gleich-Gultigkeit' in the double meaning
   of the German term: understood as being `indifferent' towards the
   proximate other as well as referring to equality and equal rights.}},

   frequent references to the Roman law of marriage. A careful examination
   of several passages thus shows how knowledge of Roman law, it turns
   out, enhances the reader's pleasure in Apuleius's story. The paper
   concludes by exploring the connections between Apuleius's fairytale and
   the account of his own marriage to Aemilia Pudentilla in his earlier
   work, the Apologia. Apuleius seems to be recalling, playfully, his own
   earlier legal success. At the same time, both works suggest that legal
   problems arose in Roman families not because of the actions of any

Abstract = {{At the beginning of the 1830s, the Grands Boulevards played a major

   remoulded it in order to transform it into an emblematic space
   representing a show-like city, which reduces man to mere stroller and
   consumer. Elaborating on these remarks, this paper aims at showing that
   the literary representation of space, as invented by Balzac and
   revisited by Flaubert results from a topographic imagination which is
   fraught with identity values and changes from one author to the other,

Abstract = {{This discussion deals with. the relationship between two discourse
   types that have long been considered different, if not even in
   opposition: literature and theory. Today this relationship is
   increasingly turned the other way round: increasingly frequent usage of
   the vocabulary of the hard sciences is typical of modern discourse
   about literature, whereas the social sciences prefer to resort to
   imagination and the imaginary potential of literary discourse. This
   blurring of boundaries - which strives to unite literature and theory,
   novels, and sociological discourse into one umbrella-genre, and for
   some kind of great theory in an esthetic disguise - results in a
   confusing closeness between literary processes on the one hand, and
   literary criticism and fictionalized literary theory on the other. This
   is also demonstrated by author-theoreticians (or better:
   theoretician-authors) such as Philippe Sollers, 1461 ne Cixous, and
   John Barth. In these circumstances, a dangerous and confusing two-way
   flow of concepts and methods has begun to take place. This was
   highlighted by the American physicist Alan Sokal's hoax. In an article
   with the eccentric title Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a
   Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity, he allegedly grafted
   the deconstructive discourse of literary theoreticians onto the field
   of exact science and, so to speak, ``planted{''} it on trendy literary
   theoreticians, who effortlessly acted against any discrepancy between
   the hard sciences and the social studies, on the one hand, and the
   humanities on the other. Despite the common dimension of these
   discourses, based upon the self-reflective move of literature itself,
   the discussion argues for the preservation of differences between them
   and warns against the danger of the interdisciplinary approach.
   Paradoxically, this approach would be reductionist because it would
   cause an oversimplification of both literature and theory. In contrast
   to theory, literature is not subject to the excluding logics of or-or,
   instead, in its commitment to the principle of just as ..., it always
   remains open to the multiplicity of alternative worlds inapplicable to
   only a single universe of meaning.}},

Abstract = {{The White Paper on Education (2006) re-emphasises the importance of
   parents within education policy and, in particular, the key role of
   parental choice. However, this article argues that parental choice is
   an inequitable process in which privileged parents are far more likely
   to have and exercise choice than their less privileged counterparts.
   The consequences are geographies of schooling which are highly class
   differentiated. Compounding these inequitable geographies of schooling
   are invidious representations of inner-city comprehensives as unruly
   places, characterised by poor performance and bad behaviour. Drawing on
   Rob Shield's conceptualisation of `places on the margin' and the voices
   of working-class students, this paper attempts to present a different
   perspective on inner-city comprehensives from those represented in
   dominant middle-class imaginaries.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last century, investigation of pretend companions has
   developed as an emerging field. Although pretend companions are a
   commonplace childhood phenomenon and perhaps an epitome of children's

   begun to burgeon. Broad developments in the history of thought and
   research on pretend companions fall into 6 stages: (a) early history,
   (b) early theory, (c) earliest empirical research, (d) midcentury lull,
   (e) a renewal of empirical attention, and (f) emergence into a
   significant field whose investigators are committed to reliable,
   increasingly sophisticated methods and to the examination of pretend
   companions within the broader context of pretend play. Following
   depictions of the field's past and current status, the authors present
   future directions for its progress.}},

Abstract = {{In 1945, Jean Cocteau(1889-1963) directed a movie Beauty and the Beast
   for which Jean Marais (the Beast) had to be heavily made up on the face
   and on the hands.
   But simultaneously, the poet suffered from a severe eczema crisis on
   the hands and on the face. The fact that the symptom appears in both
   characters as a mirror effect leads us to consider a possible
   psychosomatic dimension.
   In the light of the diary Cocteau wrote during the shooting of Beauty
   and the Beast (Journal du film) and the Freudian unconscious according
   to Jacques Lacan's analysis of Pavlov experience, we are giving
   particular attention to the poet's knowledge about his dermatosis.
   So, the way the poet slips from the literary world could be
   unexpectedly correlated to the nature of the symptom itself.
   The creation and the symptomatic way Cocteau seems to be prisoner of
   the imaginary lead us to contemplate the status of knowledge in the
   chain of significance and the writing as a substitute which would
   result in a specific physical pleasure decisive for that kind of
   patient.
   The poetic way Cocteau plays with letters and signatures results from a
   quest of the name. This sheds light to the strange mystic tone of
   patients interested in what Lacan mysteriously names << the signature
   of all things >>.
   When the Other, in the reality, conceals the truth, this harms a
   subject deprived of knowledge explaining so his difficulty to insert
   himself later on in a transferential relationship. (C) 2007 Public par

Journal = {{ETUDES FRANCAISES}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{43+}},
Abstract = {{For the past twenty years, Quebec theatre has been characterized by a
   new linguistic imaginary, that of multilingualism. The striking
   contrast with the former unilingual norm persuades most critics to
   consider the use of foreign languages in Quebec drama as a mimetic or
   symbolic reflection of today's cosmopolitan reality. This paper seeks
   to go beyond such a referential reading by studying the poetic networks
   of multilingualism in two significant plays - Larry Tremblay's The
   Dragonfly of Chicoutimi, and The Dragons' Trilogy, a collective work
   under the direction of Robert Lepage. Although the concept of textual
   strategy developed by Lise Gauvin for the analysis of novelistic
   multilingualism is helpful in defining some of the identitary fictions
   generated by language conflict and contact in Quebecois drama, such an
   identitary paradigm proves inadequate to express the multilingual
   dynamics of the two selected plays. Indeed, in each of these plays,
   interlingual communication takes place within psychological and
   thematic boundaries that underline the intimate rather than the social
   impact of the various languages used by the characters. Thus, while
   renewing the social imaginary of language, multilingualism as a textual
   strategy also appears to be an unexpected yet privileged way of
   connecting contemporary drama in Quebec to what Jean-Pierre Sarrazac
   calls the ``theatre de l'intime{''} ({''}intimate theatre{''}).}},

   was underscored by FA. Hayek and, now, by Jeffrey Friedman. But the
   more important manner in which markets overcome ignorance was
   identified by Hayek's mentor, Ludwig von Mises, and is not mentioned by
   Friedman: when market prices are not perfectly aligned to supply and
   demand conditions (and they never are), they present profit
   opportunities to entrepreneurs who are alert to make such discoveries.
   Their profit-motivated actions then reallocate resources in a pattern
   more efficiently reflecting the true supply and demand conditions. It
   is this way of overcoming ignorance that most clearly separates the
   market arena from the political arena, because no corresponding
   corrective discovery process exists in politics.}},

Abstract = {{This study developed and tested an ``Internet-attilbute-perception{''}
   model that explains bow self-disclosure develops in instant messaging
   (IM) interactions. Following hyperpersonal communication theory, two
   attributes of computer-mediated communication (i.e., reduced nonverbal
   cues and controllability) were assumed to be responsible for increased
   online self-disclosure in IM. However, our model posed that any actual
   effects of these attributes would depend on users' perceptions of the
   relevance of these attributes. Furthermore, our model posed that these
   perceptions would mediate the relationship between personality
   characteristics (i.e., private and public self-consciousness, and
   social anxiety) and online self-disclosure. Using structural equation
   modeling on a sample of 1,203 Dutch adolescents, we found that
   adolescents' perceptions of the relevance of reduced nonverbal cues and
   controllability encouraged their feelings of disinhibition, which in
   turn increased their online self-disclosure. As expected, private and
   public self-consciousness and social anxiety stimulated adolescents'
   perceptions of the relevance of reduced nonverbal cues and
   controllability, but did not directly influence online self-disclosure,

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the book Peace by Revolution written by the
   Austrian political analyst Frank Tannenbaum and illustrated by the
   Mexican painter Miguel Covarrubias. Published originally in 1932, the
   book is one of many English-language works that aimed at offering a
   broad review of the background, details, and achievements of the 1910
   armed struggle in Mexico. This article analyzes the book's
   lexical-visual relations, in order to explain how such an illustrated
   work constituted both a manifestation and an element of the imaginary
   through which English-speakers conceived Mexico after the 1910
   revolution. The author examines the book's lexical-visual corpus as a
   representative example of the work of foreign and Mexican writers and
   artists, and, consequently, as a trans-cultural and extra-territorial
   effort resulting in the construction of the imaginary that represented
   this revolutionary Mexico in other countries.}},

Title = {{Teaching imaginary children: University students' narratives about

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the dialogic processes involved in how teachers
   talk about their students and what consequences their ways of talking
   (i.e., ``narratives{''}) may have for their guidance. We take a
   sociocultural perspective on learning as transformation of students'
   subjectivity. Teaching, as a process of guiding And facilitating
   learning, cannot be effective if the teacher does not actively seek how
   the student perceives and understands reality. We borrow and adapt from
   Bakhtin (1999) four narrative ways of talking about others:
   objectivizing, subjectivizing, problematizing and finalizing. The
   presence of these narratives in web discussion postings of our
   pre-service teachers about the Latino children they worked with in a
   community center are analyzed. We then compare their ways of talking
   about children with print-and web-based discussions about children made
   by in-service teachers, model teachers and our pre-service teachers in
   a school-based practicum. Using mixed quantitative and qualitative
   methodologies, we found an overwhelming predominance of objectivizing
   and finalizing in our pre-service teachers' narratives about the
   children with whom they work that seems to define a certain pedagogical
   regime that we call here ``teaching imaginary children/students.{''}
   This ``way of talking{''} about children seems to be characterized by
   unchecked speculations guiding instruction that are not tested by
   finding out from the children themselves how they understand the
   instruction and the world. These speculations, in turn, can lead to a
   dogmatic approach towards children.
   We found another model of teaching/learning in ways that model teachers
   talk about their students based on a ``community of learners{''}
   approach to instruction. This approach prioritizes subjectivizing and
   problematizing of students that can help to recursively correct the
   assumptions and preconceptions teachers may have of their students. Our
   own preservice teachers were increasingly likely to subjectivize the
   Latino children over the course of the 9-week practicum. We suggest
   that the promotion of subjectivizing and problematizing of students
   should become a central part of the curriculum of pre-service teacher
   preparation and in-service teacher professional development programs.
   Without talking and listening to their students, teachers cannot know
   how the students think, feel, and perceive the world and themselves; in
   turn, it is very difficult for teachers to engage in collaboration with
   their students about learning. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This article takes as its provocation Marx's intriguing statement about
   the disjunction between the flowering of Greek art and the
   underdeveloped stage of social and economic development made as an
   epilogue to the Introduction to the Grundrisse in order to ask what are
   the relations between that which has been considered art and what Marx
   calls `production as such'. In the elaborated conditions of
   contemporary capitalist societies, we can ask: Is art still being made?
   To examine this question I juxtapose what Bauman has called `thinking
   sociologically' with a proposition that art thinks aesthetically. So
   how can art historians deal with that challenge of thinking aesthetic
   practices both socially and historically? I track a genealogy of art
   historians (Clark, Antal, Shapiro) who have attempted to think socially
   about artistic practices. This leads into a section about the necessity
   for both sociological and aesthetic education if we are to avoid
   totalitarianism or free-market individualism (Bahro). Finally, thinking
   sociologically, by taking as a case study the work of Aby Warburg, I
   explore the technological conditions of art historical production
   itself particularly in relation to photography and the way this shapes
   our access to the image. Warburg represents the possibility of another
   model for art historical thinking about the image as
   Kulturwissenschaft, a parallel to Sozialwissenschaft in its ambition
   and relation to the great intellectual revolutions c. 1905 (Freud,
   Bergson, Einstein, Hussserl). Like Marx, Warburg questioned the
   continuity of the imaginary space of art thinking in the age of
   technological industrialism. Where art is now, where art history is,
   are not just sociological questions to which Marx might offer a dismal
   answer. I conclude that what is necessary is a constructive
   conversation between thinking sociologically and thinking
   aesthetically, knowing synthetically and knowing for oneself -
   curricular issues made more intense by the shared conditions in which
   all intellectual production is being transformed in contemporary sites
   of intellectual practice, the university, by `production as such'
   leading thought to risk the same fate as art in contemporary society,
   as Marx hypothesized. As a final thought, I suggest that in
   contemporary art work that confronts trauma and catastrophe, often
   using new technologies as aesthetic processes, we may find a
   counter-argument.}},

   Lounsbery argues that Demons' representation of the provinces responds
   to a certain imaginary geography of Russia, one that can locate meaning
   only in a center. The ideological implications of this geography are
   played out in Dostoevskii's representation of the railroad as a
   sinister and ever-widening network extending across a blank landscape.
   The interlocking rail lines ``covering Russia like a spider web{''}
   reflect the provincial revolutionaries' paranoid political vision as
   well as their inability to see themselves as anything but tiny points
   on this network, insignificant without the web's power to connect them
   to a hub of meaning. Lounsbery relates Dostoevskii's geographic vision
   to patterns that structure the representation of Russian space in works

   Saltykov-Shchedrin, and Anton Chekhov.}},

   Oedipal, Western, male Symbolic and to find their voices, as writers,
   as women, and as Africans. The paper emphasizes, however, that language
   is always, in fact, blended. What is being contested is the hierarchy
   between polarized dimensions, such as the figurative over the literal,
   the Symbolic over the Imaginary, English over indigenous languages, and
   Europe over Africa. What we see is how the protagonists of Emecheta and

Abstract = {{The possibility of a psychoanalytic treatment or cure in the case of a
   psychotic patient is the controversial subject of many discussions. We
   are reminding in this paper Freud's different positions about this
   subject, in order to show his ambivalence. We examine further the
   hypotheses and techniques that are proposed by several schools of
   psychoanalysis and we show how the technical rules of the treatment are
   resulting mainly of theses hypotheses concerning the etiology and the
   pathology. The technical rules are inducing a particular position of
   the analyst, which is different for each school. We assume that these
   postures are not excluding each other, but they are reflecting
   particular ``moments{''} of the treatment, or specific ``techniques{''}
   which are more or less appropriated for each category, we explicit
   different postures and we match they with these proposed by Freudian,
   Lacanian or Kleiman authors. The imaginary transference is the one
   described by Freud in ``An Outline of Psychoanalysis{''}. It represents
   the transfer on the analyst's person of an early significant figure
   (imago). We argue the idea that the initial transference of a psychotic
   person is a transfer of ``functions{''}, as in the R-scheme described
   by Lacan. The symbolic transference involves the language, i.e. the
   working out of a delusion. The real transference is the contrary of the
   neurotic process of ``uncovering{''} the object: it is the one, which
   grasp the object into the discourse. We argue the idea that there is a
   possibility of structural mutations between psychosis and neurosis. The
   structure is conceived as a preferential pattern of relationship
   (transference) at a ``m{''} moment. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. Tous

Abstract = {{This paper sheds light on the characteristics and significance of
   historical geography in 21st century Korean novels. While drawing on
   the idea of imaginary geography in peripheral areas including today's
   Vietnam and Mexico in the twentieth century, Korean novels can be read
   as a literary form of Koreans' sense of self-expansion as a country
   that can no longer be called Third World. Furthermore, the paper notes
   that this transnational imagination coincides with the attitude that
   the 38th parallel is the true national border. Empire of Light by Kim
   Young-ha tells the story of a North Korean spy who becomes a legitimate
   citizen of the Republic of Korea, whereas Rina features a woman who
   refuses to be a Korean national. Appearing in opposition to each other,
   the two novels are driven by the paradigmatic shift from minjok to
   gungmin.
   The transnational imagination presented in both Black Flower and Sim
   Cheong set in the early twentieth century laments the end of the
   masculine subject in modernity, through the combination of global

Abstract = {{The outbreak of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was widely regarded by
   the international community as a `humanitarian nightmare'. Imagining

   of these geopolitical imaginaries and their associated policies on the
   practices of NGOs in the northern Bosnian town of Brcko. Drawing on the
   conceptual vocabulary of Pierre Bourdieu, it argues that NGOs have
   struggled to accumulate social and cultural capital, vital to ensuring
   donor funding and maintaining links with the local state. The author

   `compromise'. The analysis looks to the ways in which the concept of
   landscape entered geography as a device uniquely able to match the
   Romantic imaginary of the emergent European bourgeoisie and this
   latter's need for a scientific (and a-political) theory of knowledge.
   Humboldt's geographical idea of landscape was precisely the
   `compromise' that would provide the bourgeoisie with a new spatial
   theory. What I claim in this paper, following Franco Farinelli's
   critical rewriting of the history of European geography, is that the
   nature of Humboldt's attempt has been essentially cancelled from
   canonical disciplinary accounts, for a number of historical-political
   reasons. This accounts for why, even today, despite the achievements of
   the new cultural geography and the influence of nonrepresentational
   theories, landscapes all too often continue to be read either as texts
   or, worse still, as `real' spaces and/or built environments.}},

Abstract = {{While the self-representation of our bodies is a key element in our
   belief that we are autonomous individuals with a `' first-person

   representation of the body parts. Psychoanalysis considers body image
   as inter-twining the imaginary and symbolic aspects of identity, and
   insists on its dependence on the Other's regard; this link to regard
   appears in the term specular image. This paper first presents a history
   of the modern psychiatrical, psychological and neurological conceptions
   of own-body representation. Next, it considers applications of the
   Lacanian notion of specular image in neurological disorders of body

Abstract = {{The resurgence of religious movements all over the world, their varying
   claims to identity and politics (from public deliberations to
   fundamentalism), and their success in generating system-transforming
   effects in both national and world politics have indicated clearly that
   there is a need to uncover the invisible interconnections between
   religion and politics. Moreover, the way in which religion has been
   striking back has taken different forms. From religious and terrorist
   fundamentalism to multiculturalism, from communitarian claims to the
   religious state to religion-based civil societal calls for pluralism
   and freedom, it is possible to see different articulations of the
   resurgence of religion in the world in which we live. In this context,
   Turkey constitutes a sociologically illuminating, theoretically
   challenging and politically timely case study. As a modern republic on
   the margins of Europe and preparing for accession negotiations with the
   European Union for full membership, Turkey is both a Muslim society and
   a strictly secular nation-state. This article suggests, first, that the
   process of modernization and democratization in Turkey has always faced
   the problem of establishing a delicate balance between politics and
   religion, and, second, that in this process the more secularism is used
   by the state elite to control religion, the less pluralistic and
   democratic the state has become in governing a society where Islam has
   always played an important role in the symbolic formation of Turkish
   identity. What is needed in this context is a `democratic secular
   imaginary' as a more dialogical, tolerant and accommodating strategy of
   living with difference, enabling us to understand religious claims to
   difference in their own right, and to approach them clearly and
   critically.}},

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{142-155}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Quality and sustainability are both socially constructed, ambiguous
   terms, but they have not been heretofore linked in the rural studies
   literature. The ``quality turn{''} has received particular attention
   from researchers for its potential to organize linkages among various
   forces in agrofood systems, providing more income to producers by
   appealing to affluent, reflexive consumers. A distinct line of rural
   research has attended to the challenge of agro-environmental pollution
   and regulation, but this research trajectory has been subsumed under
   the broader paradigm of sustainability. This article seeks to
   contribute to discussions about quality in the agrofood sector by
   analyzing the potential of fusing rural resource protection practices
   with place-based marketing of enhanced quality, drawing from an
   empirical study of the California winegrape industry. In several
   California commodities, agroecological partnerships are becoming the
   chief vehicle for extending sustainable agricultural practices.
   California's winegrape farmers have undertaken more partnerships to
   greater effect than those of any other US crop, and they are now
   discursively linking their sustainable farming practices, environmental
   quality, and wine quality. This marks a new linkage of two heretofore
   discrete social imaginaries. This article argues that ``quality{''} is
   a term that can conceptually link increasing consumer demand for
   differentiated product taste with increasing regulatory pressure for
   environmental protection. Synergistic benefits from such a linkage have
   the potential to strengthen rural development initiatives. Making
   progress toward sustainability requires collective action on the part
   of producers, and in some commodities, may mesh well with efforts to
   enhance foodstuff quality. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The story of Rose Quong (1879-1972) reveals how an Australian learned

   literature and traditions, and performing her own Chineseness. She
   juggled her mixed Australian, British and Chinese heritage in both

   imperial metropolis in the staging of an Australian's transnational
   career, even for an Australian whose imaginary homeland was China. The
   fact that Quong was embraced by the Australian community in London adds
   a new perspective on White Australia, even though that community was

   widespread commemorative practices such as roadside shrines, pregnancy

Abstract = {{Readers of Kierkegaard are in general agreement in seeing in the
   aesthetic stage a simple step destined to be surpassed for a more

   Aesthetics, as conceived by Kierkegaard in his essay on Mozart's Don
   Juan, is presented less from the viewpoint of existential indigence
   than from that of the ontological foundation of a subjectivity of which
   passion is the final term. As a life placed from the start under the
   sign of the multiple, of evanescence and of the imaginary, that of Don
   Juan presents itself more profoundly as incarnating the elementary
   passion that constitutes all of the being of the subject before the
   latter determines itself as existence properly speaking. The appeal to
   the phenomenology of Michel Henry and to his concept of affectivity
   makes it possible for the A. to put forward this thesis, according to
   which Kierkegaard only conceives the dialectic of stages as originating
   in a pure life which Don Juan incarnates musically, without, however,
   accomplishing it as a concrete existence (transl. J. by Dudley).}},

Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{Using qualitative data from a research project investigating
   contemporary rural identities in England this paper examines the
   apparently contradictory discursive claims that are made on rural
   spaces. It looks in particular at the ways in which these are narrated
   through the notions of rural space as a site of safety, orderliness and
   community on the one hand and as a site of freedom, anti-order and
   non-regulation on the other. While the former is a familiar, entrenched
   and critiqued representation of rurality, the latter narrative has a
   more marginal and ambivalent place in the dominant rural imaginary.
   Drawing on Foucault's concepts of panopticism and heterotopia the paper
   demonstrates the ways in which the rural is a highly labile concept and
   emphasises its continual `unfinishedness'. However, alongside this, the
   paper suggests that the tensions and contradictions of the orderly and
   anti-orderly discourses are underpinned by a particular coherency that
   is driven by senses of community, belonging and self-regulation. While
   these do not resolve the contradictions of the discursive claims the
   potency of such drivers are sufficient to produce a particular
   inclusive spatiality which is able to accommodate and incorporate the
   different discursive positions and the practices that are associated
   with each. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Western travelers move throughout the world-especially to places in
   `the East'-believing themselves to be harbingers of modernity,
   spreading capitalism, socioeconomic development, Western culture, and
   other promises of modernization to places they assume are existing in
   states of pristine Otherness. In this paper I look at interactions
   between travelers and locals that reveal differing spatial imaginaries
   of `modernity, and at how these reflect and produce different
   narratives of who is modern and where modernity exists. By using
   ethnographic material, I examine discursive and material interactions
   surrounding modernity through the examples of travelers' practices of
   photography, dress, and knowledge of Muslim women's veiling. In this
   paper I look to a located, gendered, and particular expression of an
   Islamic modernity, one that embraces improvements in quality of life
   that modern technologies of health care, agricultural production, and
   sanitation may bring, and which simultaneously embraces nonsecular ways
   of being in the world.}},

   Linde was conceived by Jorge-Luis Borges as an example of

   philosophy. For Mr. Zur Linde Aristotle and Plato represent this
   confrontation, and each philosophical debate in history could be
   considered as a moment in it. But now, in the lost fight, the will to
   power of man has gone beyond all the limits, even of morality. However
   some modern techniques of appropriation of ancient philosophy are
   completely opposed to this conception, namely Paul Ricoeur's theory of
   fiction and Heidegger's Sein und Schein,. Ultimately, the close
   relationship between poetry and philosophy since its origins speak
   against this thesis. A closer analysis of Nietzsche and Holderlin will
   help to enlighten how wrong Zur Linde's conception is..}},

Abstract = {{This article uses the anti-nuclear activism of Indian women as a case
   study to question the relevance of statist discourses of security in

   utilized by the Indian state to legitimize India's nuclear policies;
   how the Indian state's perceptions of (in)security has collided with
   `people-centric' visions of security; and finally, how activism has
   enabled these women to de-center a militaristic and communal vision of
   (in)security that undergirds India's nuclear policy. I also highlight
   the ways in which women's activism has differed from that of men's
   including how women activists have used distinctive rationales and
   strategies to oppose Indian nuclearization. The contribution of this
   article lies in stitching together the spirit of inclusiveness that
   brings these women's leadership qualities, capabilities, and

   inherited from the past; second, to analyse Canto's own production of
   both imaginary and historically known spaces as a mechanism for
   defining masculine and feminine difference in her culture, and

Abstract = {{Axelord's {[}(1970), Conflict of Interest, Markham Publishers, Chicago]
   index of conflict in 2 x 2 games with two pure strategy equilibria has
   the property that a reduction in the cost of holding out corresponds to

   that if losing becomes less costly, a player is less likely to gamble
   to win, which means that conflict will be less frequent. This approach
   leads to a new power index and a new measure of stubbornness, both
   anchored in strategic reasoning. The win probability defined as power
   constitutes an equilibrium refinement which differs from Harsanyi and
   Selten's {[}(1988), A General Theory of Equilibrium Selection in Games,
   MIT Press, Cambridge] refinement. In contrast, Axelrod's approach
   focuses on preferences regarding divergences from imaginary outmost
   rewards that cannot be obtained jointly. The player who is less
   powerful in an asymmetric one-shot game becomes more powerful in the
   repeated game, provided he or she values the future sufficiently more
   than the opponent. This contrasts with the view that repetition induces
   cooperation, but conforms with the expectation that a more patient

   argues that this perspective is insufficient to explain female
   migration. Based on a qualitative analysis of the life stories of
   twenty women from Latin America, Southeast Europe and the Middle East,
   we conclude that many factors other than economic hardship shape the
   decisions of women to migrate. In particular, a desire to achieve
   gender equality in wider society and at the household level appears to
   be a strong motivation for migration. Positive images of Europe, of
   Europeans, and of gender relations in Europe favor countries like
   Switzerland as a migration destination. We conclude that when women
   cross boundaries they are constructing and reconstructing gender, and
   that gender shapes their patterns of migration.}},

   Imitation performance was videotaped for blind scoring on 21 possible

   less mature imaginary grip in transitive gestures. Typical for
   high-functioning participants with autism was their preference for
   immature mirror-image imitations. These observations support the

   values unboundedness and promotes methodological freedom, but it also
   implies a problematic reconfiguration of holism (on a grander scale).
   Whereas these formulations were extremely productive in straining
   against certain methodological rigidities, their very success in
   breaking down `boundaries' has given rise to new problems in the doing
   and writing of ethnography. Written from the perspective of a recent
   Ph.D. graduate and first-time fieldworker, the article suggests we
   reconsider the value of self-imposed limitations, of boundedness as a
   methodological tool. What role did the bounded field-site play for its
   so-called `traditional' practitioners in social/cultural anthropology?
   What role could it play for anthropologists who have taken on board the
   precepts of multi-sitedness? Based on a case study from my own
   fieldwork in Corsica, I argue that we could think of boundedness
   (paradoxically) as a productive way of challenging holisms and
   deferring closure. The bounded field-site, rethought as an `arbitrary
   location', becomes an explicitly `partial' and incomplete window onto
   complexity.}},

Abstract = {{A problem facing anthropologists, given the centrality of memory and

   2001: 163). In response to these observations I would argue that
   orthodox approaches are limited and we need to create new forms of

Journal = {{JAVNOST-THE PUBLIC}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{63-79}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article aims to analyse journalists' professional imagination in
   connection to EU news. A special attention is paid to the variety of
   ideas about European public sphere that inform (or fail to inform)
   journalists' work. The article is based on 149 semi-structured
   qualitative journalist interviews conducted in the home offices of
   mainstream news organisations in ten European countries. The article
   takes up Charles Taylor's idea that public sphere belongs to the key
   social imaginaries of modernity and treat journalists as important
   carriers of these social imaginaries. These professional imaginaries
   are traced by looking at how journalists perceive the locus of news,
   how they define their professional role vis-a- vis how they define
   their audience, and finally, how they would describe the political and
   communication problems within the EU. From this reasoning three
   relatively coherent lines of thought were derived: classical
   professionalism, secular discourse, and cosmopolitan discourse. As a
   conclusion the article attempts to map out these different discourses
   in connection to modes of political communication. The three discourses
   detected in the article can be seen as contemporary versions of
   professionalism in European news organisations. As such, they do not
   give much ground to assume that a European public sphere would emerge
   out of national journalistic cultures. Given the emergent nature of
   publics and public spheres, this does not mean that such practices may
   not be developed outside journalism.}},

Abstract = {{In quantitative models of visual search it has usually been assumed
   that visual lobe area shape was sufficiently regular to be approximated
   by a circle or ellipse. However, the irregularities in visual lobe
   shapes that have been found in studies involving extensive lobe mapping
   have suggested that lobe shape may have important implications for
   visual search performance and for the accuracy of mathematical models
   used for performance prediction. However, no systematic research on the
   relationship between the shape aspect of visual lobes and search
   performance seems to have been carried out and no comparisons of visual
   lobe shape characteristics under the effect of target difficulty have
   been reported. The current study was conducted to achieve two major
   objectives in two experiments. Experiment I used two different targets
   (letter `O' and letter `Y') to map the visual lobes of subjects in
   order to provide a systematic and quantitative comparison of lobe shape
   characteristics and experiment 2 was to investigate the correlation of
   visual lobe shape characteristics with visual search time under the
   effect of target difficulty. The visual lobes of 28 subjects were
   mapped on 24 imaginary and regularly spaced meridians originating from
   the centre of the visual field to resemble the full field mapping
   situation. Five categories of shape indices, viz. roundness, boundary
   smoothness, symmetry, elongation and shape regularity were
   investigated. The results of this study demonstrated that the visual
   lobe shapes of subjects elongate horizontally with medium level of
   roundness, high levels of boundary smoothness, symmetry and regularity
   for an easy target (0) against a homogeneous background of `X's. When a
   difficult target (Y) was used, the visual lobes of the subjects were
   still elongated horizontally but to a smaller extent and with a low
   level of roundness, medium level of boundary smoothness and regularity
   and a similar high level of symmetry to the easy target. Moreover,
   significant correlations between shape indices and visual search time
   were found, suggesting mathematical models for predicting search time
   should not merely rely on area but also should consider visual lobe
   shape indices. Finally, a universal mathematical model containing
   several visual lobe shape indices was developed, which was applicable
   in the prediction of visual search time for a range of similar search
   tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Issues concerning sexuality and gender are rarely addressed in the
   discourse of modern Turkish architecture. Given the gendered
   associations of domesticity, the architecture of the house provides the
   most obvious context to explore these issues. In the early years of the
   Turkish Republic, images of the modern house and modern, secular women
   were actively promoted by the architects and intellectuals of the new
   nation-state. Representations of women, which abound in popular
   journals but end up dispersed between the lines in contemporaneous

   the imaginary figure of an asexual ``ideal Turkish woman{''} is allowed
   to have legitimate entry to the discourse on modern Turkish culture.
   Here, I focus on the figuration of woman in architectural discourse
   with particular emphasis on a domestic reference in a book by Ismail
   Hakki Baltacioglu, a leading intellectual of the period. I argue that
   by containing an inadvertent reference to the figure of woman,

Abstract = {{The history of hyperspace is first of all a history of the various
   effects of the inner border of representation, and in this sense also a
   history of the relations between the real and the imaginary. Only on
   this basis is it possible to grasp the reason that the notion of
   hyperspace transcended the narrow field of mathematics and attained
   such an importance and popularity within the contexts of spirituality,
   religion, and art. Hyperspace made its first appearance as a concept
   related to the problem of the dimensionality of space. Since within the
   geometry of the Antiquity a representation of a geometric object was
   equal to its existence, it was only after Descartes' introduction of
   analytical geometry that the fissure between the real and the imaginary
   became possible. This fissure appears to be the basis for every move
   beyond empirical space. The proximity of mathematics ensured hyperspace
   a proximity to the truth, however, only the search for the beyond
   enabled hyperspace to represent the real thing itself. In the
   mechanistic and positivist industrial society of the nineteenth century
   hyperspace therefore appeared to be an answer to the limitations set up
   by that society. Today, considering hyperspace mostly in relation to
   the global Internet society, this form presents above all an answer to
   the limitations and demands of the ideology of individualism.}},

   this, exploring adolescence in deeper terms: not simply as an

   the self are thrown into crisis, or become destabilized (as an `open
   psychic structure', as Kristeva puts it). Adopting such a
   psychoanalytical approach, it is argued, we can begin to understand
   this book's appeal (and others like it) to adolescent and adult alike;
   that is, it stages a shift from an imaginary identification with a
   stable self to a more realistic, albeit less secure recognition of the
   flimsiness of identity. The white wastes of Antarctica provide the
   perfect backdrop for this confrontation with the ungraspable Real.}},

   Ricoeur uses this concept to understand and conceptualize the

Abstract = {{Elkind's (1967) theory of adolescent egocentrism proposes two distinct,
   but related, constructs - the imaginary audience and the personal
   fable. A corollary to the imaginary audience, the personal fable (PF)
   yields a sense of invulnerability and speciality commonly associated
   with behavioral risk-taking. When regarded as a developmental
   phenomenon, risk-taking is thought to be the result of cognitive
   immaturity. However, few adolescent health programs address the
   egocentric dimension of decision making. We believe that a valid and
   reliable measure of PF would aid assessment of risk-taking potential
   and inform preventive interventions. The present paper reports the
   results of a newly constructed measure of PF and its relation to
   risk-taking behavior. The following three hypotheses were tested using
   data from an availability sample of 119 middle school students: 1. PF
   scores will increase with age; 2. males will score higher than females
   on the invulnerability dimension of PF; and 3. PF and risk-taking will
   be positively correlated. As predicted, PF scores increased
   significantly across the age range studied. Of the two PF dimensions,
   only invulnerability significantly varied across grades. Males reported
   significantly higher invulnerability scores than females, and PF and
   risk-taking were positively correlated. Suggestions for the
   implementation of this new and, arguably, reliable and valid scale are

Abstract = {{With very few exceptions, existing scholarship on public memory in
   America has tended to script commercial-industrial ``development{''} as
   the implacable adversary of legitimate collective remembering. Indeed,
   it has become a virtual article of faith that any attempt at
   commercially underwritten historical reconstruction involves, by
   definition, an act of historical falsification. This essay sets about
   to revise this longstanding conceit by pondering some of the specific
   ways that industrial and commercial development Practices came during
   the early twentieth century to be imagined as technologies for
   producing new and viable models of a specifically white-collar history.
   To make this argument, I focus on the phenomenon of historical tourism,
   a movement that gained popularity in the 1920s and 30s (typified by
   such ventures as Henry Ford's Greenfield Village and John D.
   Rockefeller's Colonial Williamsburg), which dedicated itself to
   reconstructing vestiges of America's ``bygone{''} past. Using Colonial
   Williamsburg as my case study, I explore how the planners and promoters
   behind this movement forged a discourse of historical reconstruction
   designed to make the tactics of industrial-commercial development
   compatible with the vaunted ideals of historical recovery and cultural
   conservation. More specifically, I show how this discourse labored to
   imagine the past itself as a useful and fungible resource: a raw
   material to be taken up, managed, and improved by the agents of the
   modern corporate-capitalist order.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the East and West Indies within the broader context
   of the Commonwealth as a culture area defined by the colonising legacy

   politics, educational policy, sports, language and expressive culture).
   Ethnographically, the paper focuses on the cultural space of colonial
   and post-colonial Trinidad, with its `East' and `West' Indian
   populations. While recent critiques of area studies and colonialism
   have rightly emphasised the shaping of culture across colony and
   metropole, I show how colony-to-colony relations were crucial to the
   power and stability of empire. This historicised transregional approach
   has an impact on critical concepts of nation, metropole/periphery and

   obfuscated by the scholarly limitations of area studies.}},

Journal = {{CULTURAL STUDIES}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{599-629}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{With diamonds, mink, and champagne, black popular culture has, in
   recent years, made an audacious spectacle Of conspicuous commodity
   consumption. Commonly termed `bling', the `ghetto fabulous' aesthetic
   of these flashy displays has prompted vociferous debate about the
   cultural meanings Of contemporary black consumerism. Is it
   pathological? Subversive? Deviant? Since the nineties when it first
   appeared, the ghetto fabulous aesthetic has left its mark on a range of
   cultural productions from music videos to ghetto lit, fashion to film,
   walking a familiar line from defiance to bowdlerization, from raucous
   wild child of the streets to co-opted product tagline.
   This essay explores a new cinematic genre within this repertoire, the
   ghetto fabulous genre of black film that has emerged to variously
   castigate and congratulate black investments in ghetto fabulous bling.
   Appearing at the close of the twentieth century, the genre reflects key
   shifts in the political imaginary and economic transformations of the
   `Post-soul' era. Drawing on two such texts, Barbershop (Tim Story 2002)
   and Barbershop 2: Back In Business (Kevin Rodney Sullivan 2004), studio
   films with all-black casts and directed by young African-American
   filmmakers, this analysis focuses on their engagement with contemporary
   cultural tensions over class and consumerism, their narrative
   containment of a transformative black politics, and their
   reconciliation of post-soul priorities with hegemonic discourses of the
   market. I argue that ghetto fabulous films are quintessential products
   of the post-soul era, their allegorical priorities in pointed accord
   with neo-liberal individualism and the promise of class transcendence.
   Performing crucial work of hegemonic cooptation, these texts offer
   archetypes of the ghetto entrepreneur and black enterprise itself as a
   salvational sphere for the urban poor. Reining in unruly desires, these
   texts draw working-class African Americans into the capitalist fold,
   articulating a post-soul politics that preaches black acquiescence with
   hegemonic discourses of advanced capitalism.}},

Abstract = {{The literature on political violence has advanced some hypotheses
   concerning the forms and the causes of state-sanctioned violence and
   terror: why some governments make more widespread use of violence than
   others. However, one aspect of this question that has scarcely been
   considered concerns the conditions under which state violence achieves
   its goal, that is, to secure citizens' submission to the state. This
   article offers an analysis of the conditions of success of a certain
   form of state violence: random repression by the state. It shows that
   random repression usually does not prevent a shift in popular support
   from the regime to the opposition. But under certain circumstances, if
   the state resorts to random violence but at the same time mimics, to a
   certain extent, the behaviour of a non-arbitrary repressor, this form
   of political violence by the state can achieve success. This
   explanation is illustrated with various cases of random
   state-sanctioned violence, including occupied Europe during World War
   II, El Salvador in the 1980s, present-day Israel and, especially, the
   terror in the Soviet Union during the Stalinist period. The Soviet
   regime combined random violence, through the imposition of quotas of
   arrests on each region, with signals about the legality of the arrests
   both before and during the terror process. These signals included the
   1936 Soviet Constitution and the extraction of confessions of imaginary
   crimes. This strategy was largely successful.}},

Title = {{Pharmacological treatment of borderline personality disorder}},
Journal = {{SALUD MENTAL}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{16-24}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Temperament and character are terms utilized to delineate the
   participation of biologic and psychosocial factors in the development
   of normal and disordered personality. At times, biological factors, and
   in others rearing, education, psychological and social events at an
   early age are the main determinants.\textbackslash{}
   The American Psychiatric Association describes Borderline Personality
   Disorder (BPD) as characterized by a pattern of interpersonal,
   self-image and affective instability, as well as notable impulsivity.
   In this disorder, temperament as an inherited factor plays an important
   role, as demonstrated by familial studies in which the disorder is more
   frequently present in the families of probands than non-probands. Other
   disorders where impulsivity is an outstanding feature, such as
   antisocial personality disorder and substance abuse, are also frequent
   in first degree relatives of patients with BPD.
   Psychological factors, such as sexual abuse during childhood, are
   particularly high in this disorder. This is believed to generate
   features such as emotional instability, distrust, and dissociative
   states. From this point of view, it is possible that BPD is a form of
   ``adaptation{''} not only psychological and behavioral, but also
   biological. Changes in the volume of the amygdala and hippocampus have
   been described in the brain of women abused during childhood, and those
   with BPD.
   BPD is frequently present in clinical practice, either or not
   associated to other psychiatric disorders; it can be found anywhere
   from 11 to 40.4\% according to the setting studied. This incidence is
   even higher in patients with multiple suicide attempts.
   The term ``borderline{''} was established when this pathological
   condition was conceptualized to originate between neurosis and
   psychosis. However, current understanding of personality is better
   explained with a psychobiological model based on various dimensions.
   There is one related to schizophrenia (cognitive-perceptual
   organization dimension) and others related to mood disorders (mood
   regulation dimension), impulse control (impulsivity-aggression
   dimension), and anxiety disorders (anxiety-inhibition dimension).
   Patients with BPD show persistent disturbance on the four dimensions.
   The combination of these disturbances, along with specific defense
   mechanisms and coping strategies, originate the characteristic
   behaviors of individuals with BPD.
   Regarding the first dimension (cognitive-perceptual organization), BPD
   patients manifest paranoid ideation and dissociative symptoms usually
   under severe stress. It is possible that frontal lobe functioning is
   compromised due to a reactive dopamine and norepinephrine surge in the
   prefrontal lobe.
   The disturbance in the second dimension (mood regulation) is manifested
   in BPD by rapid mood shifts due to excessive sensitivity to separation,
   frustration and criticism. Although present in all cluster B
   personality disorders, mood instability in BPD is responsible for
   stormy relationships, self-image and self-esteem fluctuations, constant
   rage and bad temper, physical fights, and feelings of emptiness. This
   mood instability seems to be related to a serotonin effect on the
   dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems.
   Disturbances in the third dimension (impulsivity-aggression) originate
   a lack of control in the use of alcohol and/or drugs, as well as binge
   eating, reckless driving, shopping sprees, suicide gesture/attempts,
   self mutilation, and uncontrollable/inappropri-ate anger. Most studies
   note the inverse relationship between serotonin levels, and
   impulsivity, aggression, and self-harm behavior.
   Finally, abnormalities in the fourth dimension (anxiety-inhibition)
   manifest as themselves frantic attempts to prevent real or imaginary
   abandonment. No neurobiological substrate has been proposed in this
   dimension.
   The growing evidence of neurobiological basis favors the utilization of
   pharmacological agents in the treatment of BPD. This paper reviews
   available publications on controlled clinical trials, hoping to provide
   a guide in the prescription of psychopharmacological agents to the
   patient with BPD. These patients can benefit from pharmacological
   treatment for impulsivity, psychotic states, affective instability and
   depression.
   After establishing a diagnosis, and ruling out associated conditions
   -such as major psychiatric disorders, substance use disorders, and/or
   general medical conditions-, a treatment plan including medications can
   be implemented.
   Studies on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's) show the
   efficacy of fluoxetine in diminishing irritability and aggression and,
   to a lesser degree, depressed mood. A study adding fluoxetine to
   behavioral dialectic therapy did not seem to improve the outcome.
   Fluvoxamine, an antidepressant from the same class, improved emotional
   lability.
   Antipsychotics have shown to be useful. Olanzapine is the most studied
   of the atypical antipsychotics. Case reports using quetiapine and
   clozapine have also been published. Haloperidol improved depression,
   anxiety and anger.
   Anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine, valprote and, more recently
   topiramate, were reported to improve depressed mood, aggression and
   self-mutilation.
   TCAs and MAOI's seemed to help in symptoms such as anxiety, anger,
   suicidal ideation and rejection sensitivity. In turn, benzodiacepines
   were associated with decreased impulse control, increased aggression
   and risk for overdose.
   Based on this literature review, the following considerations can be
   made:
   Patients with BPD, where aggressive behavior, self-multilation, or
   chronic disphoria are the outstanding features, should be started on an
   antipsychotic and as second option an anticonvulsant. In resistant
   cases, clozapine or lithium should be considered.
   In patients where depressed mood, anxiety, or impulsivity predominate,
   it is recommended to start an SSRI; as a second option, and only in
   cases where the patient is reliable, consider a tricyclic
   antidepressant (TCA), and as a last option, a monoaminoxidase inhibitor
   (MAOI).
   In the more unstable cases, a combination of two or more medications
   may be needed. Fortunately, there is one study evaluating the
   combination of fluoxetine and olanzapine. In the practice, drug
   combinations are frequent, and they seem to be matter of craft rather
   than science, as the clinician commonly uses his/her experience rather
   than the limited published evidence. Treatment with medication should
   be started at a low dose, slowly increased for at least four weeks, as
   most controlled studies available do not show improvement earlier.
   Therefore, it is not recommended to change or add medications before
   waiting for a reasonable period, in spite of a patient's demand
   expecting a faster relief to his/her suffering.}},

   Methods. Finnish nulliparous women experiencing severe fear of

   a psychologist, once together with a midwife, during the third
   trimester. One session was held 3 months after the delivery. Each
   session consisted of a discussion of fear and feelings towards the
   impending birth and parenthood in a psychotherapeutic atmosphere and of
   relaxation exercises focused on an imaginary childbirth. The results
   were compared with those of 85 women treated for fear of childbirth by
   2 appointments with an obstetrician (conventional treatment). Results.
   Before the sessions, among the women in the experimental group, scored
   fear of childbirth, on a scale of one to ten, was 6.99 +/- 2.0 (SD),
   which is similar to the score of those receiving conventional treatment
   (6.09 +/- 1.6). After the sessions, 84 women in the experimental group
   (82.4\%) and 57 in the conventional treatment group (67.1\%) chose to

Abstract = {{This essay analyzes a shift in racialized regimes of visual
   signification in French metropolitan culture during the long eighteenth
   century. The author explores two symbolically central figures-the
   dismembered black slave and the black rapist/lover who is ``duly
   punished{''}-by undertaking an intertextual reading of two sets of
   illustrations of Voltaire's Candide (1759) designed by Moreau le Jeune.
   Separated by the French and Haitian Revolutions, Moreau's two sets of
   Candide illustrations (1787 and 1803) register an important shift in
   the French cultural imaginary. The figure of the maimed black mate
   slave was put directly in circulation in French visual culture during
   the eighteenth century. In contrast, interracial sexuality remained
   ``unrepresentable{''} in French visual culture throughout the century.
   By the time Haiti declared its independence (1804), this taboo was
   contravened by Moreau's metaphorical substitution of the figure of the
   monkey in 1803 to picture the black male as a bestial rapist.}},

Abstract = {{Teaching design through learning by doing is still the dominant form of
   architectural education as it is believed that the skills, the language
   and the approach to problems of design con be learned more effectively
   through direct experience rather than through other means. That is why
   architecture students have to repeat design studio courses until they
   reach a certain level of experience.
   Design, especially the work done in design studios, has many
   similarities with ploy. Generally the subjects ore imaginary. The
   designs are presented using models trying to simulate real-life
   situations. And it has some fixed rules. Actually there is very little
   difference between a girl playing with a doll, a boy with toy trucks
   and on architecture student working on a design project. All of them
   deal with simulations, role-playing, preparing themselves for real-life
   situations. We hove observed that students learn more about design when
   they approach it in a playful manner. When they do this they also enjoy
   what they do. But this kind of education needs planning and preparation
   if it is going to yield good results. This article attempts to discuss
   about the benefits of planning a design studio as a kind of ploy
   activity by giving some examples from our experiments and observations
   we hove been conducting at our university.}},

Abstract = {{A critical examination of the transnational discourse of indigeneity in
   the context of adivasi or indigenous peoples' political struggles in
   India contrasts two Indian indigenous political movements: the
   ``transnational{''} imaginary of the Indian Council for Indigenous and
   Tribal Peoples, which is the central organization representing India's
   indigenous peoples at the United Nations, and the ``local{''} imaginary
   of the Koel-Karo movement, one of several adivasi movements against
   displacement that mark the Indian political landscape today. Given that
   these transnational and very local imaginaries both work in relation to
   different domains of governmentality; 1 question why a transnational
   governmentality involving indigenous peoples produces a static and
   essentialized discourse of indigeneity that inadvertently undermines
   local initiatives like Koel-Karo. Rural adivasi populations redeploy
   elements of colonial and nation-state governmentality forged in
   relation to them in ways that demonstrate a remarkable flexibility in
   the imagination of indigeneity. As the neoliberal regime in India has,
   with a terrifying intensity, contributed to the displacement of
   adivasis, the question of indigeneity as adivasi identity has to
   address these different histories of governmentality, the modalities of
   the politics they have precipitated, and other ways of articulating
   ``local{''} adivasi movements with transnational alliances. This
   examination of indigeneity in India concludes by problematizing some of
   the ways in which contemporary academic discourse has interpreted
   ``governmentality{''} in relation to subaltern movements.}},

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-31}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this essay I argue that Anthony Trollope's The Warden (1855)
   anticipates and problematizes Trollope's oft-cited representativeness
   of the Victorian period generally, and Victorian liberalism in
   particular. As Jurgen Habermas has shown, Victorian liberalism should
   be construed less in terms of its promotion of pluralism than in terms
   of an ``ambivalence{''} as to its practical implications.
   Correspondingly, The Warden offers a performative exemplification of
   Victorian liberalism that is instructive precisely because it
   paradoxically refuses definitively to represent it. The instruction I
   would draw from this paradox relates to the moral ``pinch{''} that
   Septimus Harding, the novel's protagonist, feels as a result of his
   aspiration to ``be right{''} as opposed to being ``proved{''} right.
   This paradox disrupts the reader's reflexive inclination to read
   Harding's emancipation in traditionally Romantic terms. just as Harding
   was ``awoken{''} from the self-induced oblivion of a hegemonic
   morality, so too the reader is awoken from the self-induced oblivion of
   the disciplinary conventions of Victorian literary experience that D.
   A. Miller and David Lloyd critique. Thus the novel can be said to
   embody Victorian liberalism precisely to the extent that it illuminates
   the question of such embodiment as open, as a practical problem
   confronting and animating Victorian society. Hence Trollope makes
   Harding's imaginary cello-playing the medium or `embodiment' of his
   ``awakening{''}: the Pursuit of ``right being{''} is a matter of
   ``testing{''} the boundaries of political action and aesthetic
   imagination alike.}},

   various cosmopolitan identities but a discursive framework for the
   formulation and articulation of these identities so as to reproduce the
   urban networks. With a particular emphasis on the `imaginary of

   city-region first by examining the ideology inherent in the discourse
   of the so-called `New Shanghai People' (xin shanghai ren), a popular
   discourse which has recently emerged to represent the identity of
   transmigrants. The second part of the paper will analyze several

   Chen-pin's bestsellers in Taipei, a series of non-fiction works on how
   to survive and succeed in Shanghai. Situating these texts in the
   context of the Taipei-Shanghai linkage, I will critique the imagination
   of the cosmopolitan identity, enabled by the material conditions of the
   urban network, and further lay bare not just the intricate connections
   between the new geopolitical regionalism and cultural narrative of
   Chinese transmigrants but the intense contradictions between the

Abstract = {{In this paper I want to ask whether there is anything to be gained by

   humanity and the natural world, one that in fact extinguishes the
   dualism and produces only `naturecultures'. I will examine this
   question through a new analysis of the relationship between gum trees
   and Australia. Most humanist accounts, such as those developed in
   `traditional' social anthropology and sociology, privilege the
   activity, agency, and representations of humans, and in so doing render
   the natural world and its individual species as passive and of interest
   only insofar as they provide a palette of meanings for essentially
   human symbolism, dreamings, and imaginaries. Such an approach has an
   impeccable track record from Emile Durkheim to Mary Douglas and it is
   not one I want to challenge here per se. What I do want to challenge is
   the implicit assumption that this is all there is to, or all we can say
   about, the relationship between nature and humanity. Rather than (only)
   ask what nature (or gum trees in this case) means, I want to ask (also)
   what nature does, and, importantly, what implications those actions
   have for the world, nature, humans, and `the social'. I argue that this

Pages = {{147-184}},
Abstract = {{How do you describe the `nature of metaphor'? Two dilemmas block your
   path. The first occurs when you encounter the metaphor's status as
   `real' in the face of its mere symbolic reference to objects. A second
   dilemma occurs when you look inward to describe the origin of metaphor.
   Although this look focuses the inner self as originator, it also
   reveals a mind-boggling question. How does your look inward relate to
   that of others?
   Resolution 1: A logical level analysis of metaphor reveals similarities
   of the forms of thought, which point to the `real' nature of inner
   experience. Resolution 2: `Metaphorizing' requires a logic of the
   imaginary - a set of forms, which accommodate an exchange of
   originating by `dramatist' and `audience.'
   The major assumptions are these: To describe the nature of metaphor
   requires a look inward from which to see formal similarities and
   origins. A focus on formal cause provides a robust account of how a
   thinker originates a metaphor. The regularities constraining the
   thinker looking inward are the same for other persons looking inward.
   These regularities are classifiable in terms of semiotic and logical
   phenomena by which parallel thinking is communicative and to some
   extent collaborative.}},

Abstract = {{Chile is a country of mask, a space of madness. A country capable of
   using those masks to save its intrinsic identity that doesn't appear in
   the daylight, in its dominating and consumer facet. It lies in its
   gloomy, creative, protean and sometimes repulsive face. First of all,
   before contemplate the masked invention problematic, we're going to
   define the narrative structure, the writing projection according to
   Hayden White and the allegories we can find in this essay. In the
   second place, we'll try to isolate the mask figure in several Chilean's
   essays and compare them with this one. We'll establish that De La
   Parra's essay performs a preponderant significance in the nation's
   symbolic construction. Thus, through an analysis considering the
   multiples manifestations of disguise, we'll stop in one of its
   exacerbation pointing out the nation as an allegory of a psychiatric
   hospital. We'll see how the national imaginary gives the mask
   implements.}},

   rules the relations among images gathered around both nuclear metaphors
   (Burgos 1982). Secondly, it will trace the ``anthropologic journey{''}
   of ruins and crystals as dynamic images that arise from the poem and
   reach subjective and social imaginaries (Durand 1960, 1993). In
   conclusion, some guidelines will be proposed in order to define the

Abstract = {{The story of the private individual destiny,{''} declares Fredric
   Jameson, `` is always an allegory of the embattled situation of the

   involvement in the cultural politics of post-colonial Indonesia, this
   essay examines the transnational dynamisms of the making of a national
   allegory and discusses the production and reception of the China images
   in Sukarno's Indonesia (1949-65), with a focus on the PRC's cultural
   diplomacy and how Chinese literary principles were appropriated and
   domesticated, subsequently constituting an integral component of
   Indonesian cultural politics. Arguing that the narratives about China (
   both as a sociopolitical entity and a cultural symbol) served as an
   important transnational inspiration to public deliberations and
   cultural polemics - thus contributing to the formation of national
   allegories in postcolonial Indonesia, this essay takes the Jamesonian
   thesis a step further by suggesting that a transnational imaginary
   within Third World countries plays a significant part in the making of
   domestic literary politics. This essay may also be taken as an exercise
   in going beyond the nation-state-centric historiography that has been
   the defining characteristic of Asian Studies and pointing to the need
   to study Sino-Southeast Asian relations from the angle of cultural
   politics and its intertwining ambiguities with conventional diplomacy.}},

Title = {{Is pain the price of empathy? The perception of others' pain in
   patients with congenital insensitivity to pain}},
Journal = {{BRAIN}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{129}},
Number = {{Part 9}},
Pages = {{2494-2507}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Empathy is a complex form of psychological inference that enables us to
   understand the personal experience of another person through
   cognitive/evaluative and affective processes. Recent findings suggest
   that empathy for pain may involve a `mirror-matching' simulation of the
   affective and sensory features of others' pain. Despite such evidence
   for a shared representation of self and other pain at the neural level,
   the possible influence of the observer's own sensitivity to pain upon
   his perception of others' pain has not been investigated yet. The aim
   of this study was to explore how patients with congenital insensitivity
   to pain (CIP), who are largely deprived of common stimulus-induced pain
   experiences, perceive the pain of others. Ratings of verbally presented
   imaginary painful situations showed that CIP patients' semantic
   knowledge regarding the pain of others did not differ from control
   subjects. Moreover, the propensity to infer pain from facial
   expressions was very similar between CIP patients and control subjects.
   On the other hand, when asked to rate pain-inducing events seen in
   video clips in the absence of visible or audible pain-related
   behaviour, CIP patients showed more variable and significantly lower
   pain ratings, as well as a reduction in aversive emotional responses,
   compared with control subjects. Interestingly, pain judgements,
   inferred either from facial pain expressions or from pain-inducing
   events, were strongly related to inter-individual differences in
   emotional empathy among CIP patients, while such correlation between
   pain judgement and empathy was not found in control subjects. The
   results suggest that a normal personal experience of pain is not
   necessarily required for perceiving and feeling empathy for others'
   pain. In the absence of functional somatic resonance mechanisms shaped
   by previous pain experiences, others' pain might be greatly
   underestimated, however, especially when emotional cues are lacking,
   unless the observer is endowed with sufficient empathic abilities to
   fully acknowledge the suffering experience of others in spite of his
   own insensitivity.}},

   in the history of religions and its current usage, very vague
   semantically, in Christian circles, where it is systematically given a
   negative connotation, opposite that of enculturation. After having
   retraced the history of the restoration of this rare word's circulation
   by Erasmus as well as its first polemical applications in the framework
   of confessional controversies, the paper examines the sense in which it
   was taken up during the twentieth century in the history of religions,
   the discipline that more than any other has strived to precise its
   meanings, and where it finally is given a sense reserved especially to
   the relations between religions at the threshold of the Christian era.
   Finally, the author attempts to specify the type of peril that the
   notion in its Christian usages is intended to denounce, notably in
   conciliar, pontifical and pastoral documents. The author also points to
   the rare theologians who, in the framework of ecumenical or
   inter-religious dialogue, subscribe to a thoughtful and positive
   approach to the phenomena encompassed by the word syncretism.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: This study aimed at exploring views and comparing level of
   consensus across different groups of mental health professionals
   regarding the appropriateness of preventive interventions targeted at
   subjects with risk factors for the development of psychosis.
   Method: A survey was completed by 135 members of the International
   Early Psychosis Association ( IEPA), by 110 psychiatrists working in
   the Italian Region Emilia Romagna, and by 114 general practitioners
   working in the Province of Modena. The survey used three hypothetical
   case scenarios where a client, having tested positive for future
   psychosis to an imaginary ``infallible{''} screening instrument,
   presents with either ( a) no symptoms and no interest in intervention;
   (b) no symptoms but requesting intervention; ( c) with some degree of
   anxiety and depression and requests assistance.
   Results: Mixed views prevailed on appropriateness of specific
   interventions across all groups regarding the hypothetical case
   scenario presented. Judgments varied according to clients' preferences
   and level of distress. IEPA members showed more inclination than other
   professionals to consider appropriate psychological and pharmacological
   intervention in an asymptomatic pre-psychotic state. The propensity for
   suggesting drug treatment was related to the belief that untreated
   psychosis causes neurotoxicity.
   Conclusions: Experts seem to have a more liberal view on the
   appropriateness of preventive interventions than community mental
   health psychiatrists and general practitioners. Further research
   addressing factors that influence experts' views seems warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Transnationalism refers to the phenomenon of immigrants maintaining
   connections to their country of origin and using a dual frame of
   reference to evaluate their experiences and outcomes in the country in
   which they have settled. How does transnationalism matter in the

   growing up with parents who want children to participate in their
   homeland imaginary and in a strong transnational social field does not
   necessarily mean second-generation Dominicans and Chinese will
   themselves adopt transnational orientations and/or practices. I find
   that my Chinese respondents, because of authoritarian parent-child
   relationships, relative loss of the ethnic language, and scarcity of
   contact with their parents' countries of origin, viewed themselves as
   mainly ethnic subjects. Identities for my Chinese respondents involved
   a generational- and class-specific ethnic identity grounded in the
   enclaves and perceived rarefaction vis-a-vis mainstream America. My
   Dominican respondents, because of greater communication within the
   family, ethnic language maintenance, and the very frequent number of
   trips they made to the Dominican Republic, drew from both transnational
   and ethnic orientations, meaning they situated who they were within
   both national contexts. Although my Dominican respondents acknowledged
   the differences between Dominicans `'back there'' and themselves, they
   spoke cogently on class, gender, and the color line there as well as
   here. At the same time, their identities were informed by their
   pan-ethnicity in the United States, namely, how Latinos and Dominicans,

   moreover, to the mystification of ``home{''} sites as imaginary places
   simply of longing and belonging. My goal is not to dismiss symbolic
   understandings of mythical homelands but rather to better contextualize
   and refine assumptions of migrant displacement in relation to
   imaginations of locality and belonging from the empirical and
   phenomenological grounds of those who remained behind. Significantly,
   approaching issues of migrant identities and social formations from the
   location of dispersion rather than arrival enabled me to critically
   examine and situate existing analytic assumptions of displacement ( e.
   g., as migrant nostalgia for ``home{''}) alongside local theorizations
   of emplacement made by those who stayed put as others moved around
   them. As I will show for my Fuzhounese subjects, the ultimate form of
   displacement was seen and experienced as the result of immobility,
   rather than physical departure from a ``home.{''}}},

Abstract = {{More than any other recent social theorist, constructing a disquisition
   on Butler's ideas draws the writer into speculating on the formation of
   their own intellectual grammar, perhaps to confront the disconcerting
   truth of how often their own cherished analytical rationality is broken
   up by glimpses into the imagination of more provocative thinkers. I
   have come to the conclusion that it is not so much that we
   self-consciously assemble all of the resources for the making of
   research imaginaries as those vivid ideas (and frequently their
   authors) come to haunt us. Butler's work has been of this `disturbing'
   order. The `unconscious of intellectual work' is worthy of more
   attention than I can offer here but it is important to bear this in
   mind in the course of the following.
   In this paper I will describe the concept of `performativity' and its
   theoretical elaboration in Gender Trouble, Bodies that Matter and
   subsequent and secondary texts. Performativity conceptualises the
   paradox of identity as apparently fixed but inherently unstable,
   revealing (gender) norms requiring continual maintenance. Her works
   thus contribute a new conceptual grammar in the inter-related concepts
   of performativity and citationality to denote a reading of gender not
   as essence nor socialisation, but as the consequence of the
   performative (i.e. recurring) `citations' of gender thought as actions
   that institute `girling', for example. Butler's insistence on seeing
   gender as constitutive (as literally making the material of the
   embodied self) signifies the social and cultural forces that come to
   sculpt femininity and masculinity as norms on the body and the psyche.
   In arguing that the Butlerian performative has complicated a reading of
   the discursive and material conditions of the processes of (gender)
   identification, I will review my own poststructuralist vocabulary with
   its focus on the sociality of subjectification as a way to interpret
   and interrogate the power and limitations of Butler's ideas. Despite
   the awkwardness entailed in transposing performativity to embodied
   practices of classed distinction, her work continues to expand the
   ethnographic imaginary.
   My exegesis of performativity also serves another purpose, as a
   methodological comment about academic praxis, as I simultaneously open
   up and share in the modes of translation used in coming to appreciate
   Butler's important and exhilarating theoretical landscape.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper examines how representations of prospective use
   became designed in a novel healthcare technology for elderly people.
   The case lends support to studies arguing that explicit investigations
   provide only a part of the representations of prospective use for
   technology design. It draws attention to a source of representations of
   use that is at once obvious and under-explored: the professional
   traditions of developers of technology. To examine this, the concept of
   practice-bound imaginary is introduced as an alternative to existing
   terms, such as technological frame. The concept enables better
   understanding of the interplay of multiple professional practices, the
   orientation of technology projects and the dynamics of how traditions
   affect the ideas about prospective use. These analytical possibilities
   were needed in the case-analysis, as the project was informed by
   several professional practices, each with their own sets of
   representations of use. Moreover, in many cases the representations of
   use were at once representations of viability, medical validity or
   manufacturability. They were often also inter-animated by adjoining
   representations from the same practice and compatible assumptions from
   other practices. Use was not only planned, configured or implicitly
   assumed, but also was inscribed by the models for conducting design,
   routine procedures and the messy interactions between people and
   materials. Designers themselves became aware of the implications of
   their solutions only after the artefact was reshaped by the resistance
   of the eventual users and refusers of the device.}},

Abstract = {{The population movements that have occurred within present-day Kerala
   should be seen in tandem with the history of the massive out-migration
   record of the state, which has earned for its people the image of being
   a robust community with a proclivity for migration. This article
   explores the fashioning of the figure of the kutiyettakkaran, a
   migrant, in the Malayalee unconscious by problematising the peasant
   migration from Travancore to Malabar during 1920-70. Reading across
   Malayalam literary representations, this article looks at the
   configuration of the migrant self as located within the problematic of
   capital and colonial modernity. These literary texts, simultaneously
   fashioned by and fashioning history, give a nuanced picture of the
   contradictions and compulsions that governed the migrants as well as
   the natives. The migrant identity of the Syrian Christian settler in
   Malabar is construed within a social imaginary regulated by a specific
   discourse of development. The fashioning and circulation of a
   modernising and heroic image endowed the migrant with a peculiar
   authority in the landscape and history of Malabar However such a
   mission is critiqued, often in absolute terms, by texts closer to our
   times. These contemporary texts, informed as much by the consequences
   of the migration, play an important role in reconfiguring the Syrian
   Christian migrant as a stooge of capital.}},

Abstract = {{Photography plays a central role in Franz Kafka's fictional travelogue
   Der Verschollene (1912-14), where it features as both explicit motif
   and implicit source material. Having never visited the United States,
   Kafka drew on genuine travel photographs as inspiration for his novel,
   assimilating them into his depiction of an imaginary America. While
   some scenes maintain the photographic stasis of their originals, others
   are animated to express the dynamism of modern life and the
   disorientation this can produce in the viewer's mind. Alongside such
   public travel photographs, however, Kafka also makes use of private
   pictures taken from his own family album. These traditional studio
   portraits act as models for the photographs featured within the plot,
   which illustrate the protagonist's continued attachment to his European
   origins. The latent sense of oppression inherent in these bourgeois
   portraits finds more brutal expression in the photographic source
   material which underlies the novel's unfinished conclusion. In the
   Oklahoma theatre episode photographic scenes of assassination and
   lynching invade the narrative, undermining its images of modernity and
   progress. In its diverse manifestations (both literal and intertextual)
   photography in Der Verschollene establishes a link between traditional
   and modern forms of visuality, thereby illustrating the circular,
   regressive character of the protagonist's journey.}},

Abstract = {{The history of Wau township in Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea, is
   intimately linked with the development of gold mining throughout the
   region. The site of a series of gold rushes in the 1920s, Wau emerged
   as an early administrative outpost, a town complete with all the
   trappings of frontier Australian communities. In recent years, Wau has
   declined, and the Biangai communities reflect on this decline in ways
   that manipulate both the early colonial discourses and their own.
   Central to these discussions are images of cannibalism, as the
   consumption of both living flesh and ancestral landscapes. In this
   paper I examine the gold rush, how early prospectors conceptualized the
   colonial project, and what Wau's subsequent decline has meant to the
   Biangai who now pursue new mining opportunities. I trace these events
   and perspectives through historical and present-day discourses.
   Throughout, a fascination with mountains, gold, and ``cannibals{''} is
   prominent, with Wau emerging out of struggles to conquer these elements
   of the landscape. Cannibalism remains a pervasive theme in contemporary
   Biangai discourses as,they now try to recreate an era of successful
   gold mining and community life in and around Wan by overcoming many of
   the same elements. However, the moral terrain between consuming flesh,
   consuming land, and consuming gold are differently deployed in order to
   explain success and failure, and to imagine the nation.}},

Number = {{2}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Walter Pater's theoretical ``come-back{''} over the past forty years or
   so has been dominated by the competing claims of the new historicism
   and deconstruction, both of which discover prescient forerunners of
   their own, seemingly mutually exclusive, theoretical concerns in
   Pater's aesthetic criticism and in his historical novel Marius the
   Epicurean (1885). Yet despite their obvious differences, both critical
   approaches share one thing in common: the same post-humanist
   denigration of the trope of metaphor in favor of the seemingly more
   ethically responsive (because inclusive) trope of metonymy. In this
   essay I observe how the new historicism's and deconstruction's
   privilegings of metonymy as the prime trope of difference poses an
   immediate problem for ethical thought that, largely under the influence
   of Alain Badiou, has become increasingly cognizant of the need for a
   workable conception of sameness (or universality), traditionally
   supplied by metaphor. Accordingly, this close reading of the
   metaphorical dialectic of one of Pater's surprisingly underread
   Imaginary Portraits, ``Sebastian van Storck{''} (1887), explores the
   basic charge against metaphor-namely, that it is an essentially
   ``theological{''} trope insofar as it invariably pre-posits the
   ``identity{''} that it modestly claims to have merely discovered.
   Employing the central figure of Sebastian's idealism-equation-I venture
   that, once rethought as a relation not of identity but of equivalence,
   metaphor is capable of shouldering the rhetorical burden of similarity
   without relinquishing its ethical claim as a primary producer of new
   differences in the world and is, hence, deserving of a central place in
   a post-deconstructive ethics.}},

Abstract = {{In the Mediterranean French-speaking literature, Salah Stetie, the

   between the East and the Occident. On the other side of the
   Mediterranean, the Memory acts like a catalyst and it fixes the
   imaginary of the poet who wishes only the Return. Therefore, it is this
   desire that works out, constructs and illuminates the way the poet
   operates a true reflection on the memory and the identity through the
   evocation of the myths and the mythical figures. By a kind of
   re-actualization of the memory, the myths bridge the world, the
   country. The author wants to find the union between the man and the
   world and from his state of exile, he raises questions about his place
   in the universe. By its dual mythical membership, the Eastern and the
   Western one, Salah Stetie is also capable to use this ancestral
   antiquated background which strengthens with its personal capital
   contribution. In a progressive creative dash, the poet devotes the myth
   and invents his own myths which propose immutable and eternal values.
   The renewal and the reformulation of the myth make it possible that the
   poet restores his perennial and universal dimension.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies over the past decade have shown that simple rating
   scales can accurately rank sex offenders' long-term risk of recidivism.
   But when using these scales as prediction tools, evaluators often wish
   to translate categories of risk into probabilities of recidivism. D. M.
   Doren (2004) has recently suggested that evaluators may use the
   recidivism percentages published in original studies of the RRASOR and
   STATIC-99 without regard to differences in populations or base rates.
   This article explains why Doren's computations should lead to a
   different conclusion, and describes how simply comparing percentages
   across studies can mislead researchers and clinicians. Instead,
   investigators should isolate and examine the detection properties of
   risk assessment instruments alone, independent of the population- or
   setting-specific base rate. This article explains this process, using
   an imaginary study to illustrate how base rates and the properties of
   risk assessment instruments yield estimated probabilities of

Abstract = {{This essay maps the connections between transgender/transsexual rights
   and nationalism in Australia. Comparing Jay Prosser's idea of a
   transsexual `politics of home' with the recent legalisation of
   transsexual marriage in Australia, it argues that marriage rights are
   granted by the state on the ability of particular bodies to maintain
   and reproduce a series of demarcated zones: between male and female,
   but also between `Australian' and `un-Australian', `white' and
   `nonwhite.' This has been most evident in a successful Australian
   transsexual marriage case, Re Kevin, where the success of the
   respondents relied on arguing that transsexuality is a biological
   condition. Establishing the gender of the transsexual respondent
   involved `proving' biology through reference to his social performance
   of normative masculinity. But the norms of masculinity used to `prove'
   such a thing are socially constructed and, as such, racialised: home
   maintenance, proficiency with powertools, enjoying the white Australian
   tradition of barbeques and sport. Exploring the Australian political
   context of the court case, where `Australian-ness' has a particular
   meaning and a particular value, I critique the liberal-democratic
   capitalist structure of rights claims in which gender variant subjects
   must present `whiteness'as a form of cultural capital in exchange for
   rights. The cost of this exchange falls overwhelmingly on gender
   variant subjects who don't present a racially/culturally normative
   performance of masculinity.}},

Abstract = {{For the many aspects of psychological time, there are many approaches
   to understanding, including cultural theories, psychological studies,
   philosophical analyses and mathematical models. A useful approach is to
   assume that there are many kinds of psychological time in coexistence,
   and to distinguish their different cultural and meaning-based contexts,
   as do Yamada and Kato (2006). From a different perspective, Rudolph
   (2006) presents rigorous mathematical models of psychological time, in
   the hope that psychologists will apply them as ways to gain insights
   into experience and change. This discussion enjoins some qualities of
   time, attention and ambivalence (Rudolph's themes) to properties of
   dialectical structures (Hood, 1995), with fluctuation as a source of
   individuality within the spiraling cycles of reversible time proposed
   by Yamada and Kato. Fluctuations at a border, especially a fractal
   border, may show the way in which a present experience contains traces
   of the past and constructions of the future. Applications of
   mathematical models in cultural contexts serve here to more fully
   elaborate the qualities of psychological time, rather than to reduce
   them as statistical products. This approach suggests a reconsideration
   of the distinctive roles of different kinds of time in the study of
   life cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This research examined the validity of criteria for

   Parents and caregivers completed child behavior, temperament, and
   socioemotional functioning questionnaires to test convergent and
   discriminant validity. Results: Of 72 children, 18 months to 5 years
   old, 19 met modified SOC criteria (8 met DSM-IV SOC criteria also), 29
   met modified GAD criteria (5 met DSM-IV GAD criteria also), and 35 met
   no anxiety disorder criteria. Children with modified SOC were more
   likely than nonanxious children to display higher levels of anxiety
   symptoms and shyness/inhibition and to have anxious parents. Modified
   SOC did not relate to the nonanxiety constructs (cuddling, imaginary
   play, fine motor). Children with modified GAD did not consistently
   demonstrate higher levels of anxiety symptoms, did not have more
   anxious parents than nonanxious children, and did not have higher mean

Abstract = {{Tessa is a 7-year-old girl with odd behaviors, worsening over the
   preceding year. She spends a significant amount of time alone in her
   room, talking to ``Richard.{''} Her father observed that Tessa is ``in
   her own world.{''} In school, she often glares at the teacher and
   refuses to work. She is alone at recess without any real friends. Her
   father reports that she eats little and only after he tastes the food.
   She is increasingly cruel to both real and toy animals. She tied a
   string around her cat's neck and swung it around, saying she wanted to
   punish it. She was heard to say to her stuffed cat, ``Die, b....;
   die.{''} Richard told her to do this and other ``bad{''} things. Tessa
   has not had chronic health problems or developmental concerns. During
   the first 18 months of life, her height was between the 5th and 10th
   percentiles; it declined to below the 3rd percentile over the past 2
   years. Weight has been consistently between the 3rd and 5th
   percentiles. Tessa's parents both have been diagnosed with
   schizophrenia. There are at least 7 first- and second-degree relatives
   with the same diagnosis.
   Both parents cared for Tessa for 4 years with a lot of support. Then,
   her father left the home, but he was in contact with her while managing
   his own illness. When the mother's illness and compliance worsened,
   Tessa was removed for neglect at 5 1/2 years old. Two foster homes
   preceded Dad's award of sole custody 13 months ago. Mother's weekly
   visitations are quite upsetting to Tessa.
   Tessa is a verbal, solemn, small, well-dressed girl with no physical
   abnormalities. She talks with advanced vocabulary and syntax, with
   normal prosody and good conversational skills. She says Richard is a
   bad boy who gets her into trouble at school. She equivocates when asked
   if he is real or imagined or if others can see him. She says that she
   misses her mother.}},

Abstract = {{The history of the Psychiatry contains the idea of narrow links between
   dreams and madness. Then, the question is to know what is imaginary,
   and what happens to the man who dreams or enters a dream state. One can
   notice that naturalist descriptions - those of the psychiatric clinics
   - despite their ideal of objectivity and exactness, do not help us to
   answer the question. We are therefore obliged to put aside this
   descriptive attitude and attempt a phenomenological explanation. This
   leads us to show the essential poverty, of the imaginary world.
   Nevertheless, one could not literally take up Sartre's words ``There is
   no imaginary world{''} literally. In support of Heidegger's lessons old
   1929-1930, one would rather say that, while sinking into imaginary
   world, man is poor in his real world. A being-hi-the-world, the Dasein
   is what his world is; the one growing poorer, and the other vanishing
   with him. Thus, dreams and madness constitue an existential narrowing.
   As far as they constitute, man has acted upon the real existential
   disaster. It would be an illusion to believe in the preservation of
   complete deep personality, in any sort of interiority. There is no
   inner man. There is only one being in the world. This is an opportunity
   to evaluate all the poverty of Psychiatry and other medical
   disciplines. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. Tous droits reserves.}},

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{401-413}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated acquisition of a mirror-reading skill via
   imagery training, without the actual performance of a mirror-reading
   task. In experiment I, healthy volunteers simulated writing on an
   imaginary, transparent screen placed at eye level, which could be read
   by an experimenter facing the subject. Performance of this irrelevant
   motor task required the subject to imagine the letters inverted, as if
   seen in a mirror from their own point of view (imagery training). A
   second group performed the same imagery training interspersed with a
   complex, secondary spelling and counting task. A third, control, group
   simply wrote the words as they would normally appear from their own
   point of view. After training with 300 words, all subjects were tested
   in a mirror-reading task using 60 non-words, constructed according to
   acceptable letter combinations of the Portuguese language. Compared
   with control subjects, those exposed to imagery training, including
   those who switched between imagery and the complex task, exhibited
   shorter reading times in the mirror-reading task. Experiment II
   employed a 2x3 design, including two training conditions (imagery and
   actual mirror-reading) and three competing task conditions (a spelling
   and counting switching task, a visual working memory concurrent task,
   and no concurrent task). Training sessions were interspersed with
   mirror-reading testing sessions for non-words, allowing evaluation of
   the mirror-reading acquisition process during training. The subjects
   exposed to imagery training acquired the mirror-reading skill as
   quickly as those exposed to the actual mirror-reading task. Further,
   performance of concurrent tasks together with actual mirror-reading
   training severely disrupted mirror-reading skill acquisition; this
   interference effect was not seen in subjects exposed to imagery
   training and performance of the switching and the concurrent tasks.
   These results unequivocally show that acquisition of implicit skills by
   top-down imagery training is at least as efficient as bottom-up
   acquisition. (C) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IIBRO.}},

Pages = {{1-18}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The ancient Greek historian and political scientist Polybius is not as
   well known in the present day as figures such as Herodotus, Thucydides,
   Plato and Aristotle. This is in part due to his having lived in the
   Hellenistic period, an epoch often thought to be characteristic of
   Greek cultural and political decline, rather than in the earlier
   `golden age' of Greek intellectual life in the 5th and 4th centuries
   BCE. Yet Polybius's ideas have been of profound importance in modern
   western thought, in areas as diverse as historiography, philosophy of
   history and the theorization of political institutions. This article
   illustrates the main contours of how subsequent thinkers have received
   and made use of Polybian ideas and themes, and argues for regarding
   Polybius as an important precursor of contemporary social scientific
   analyses of `globalization'. The article first excavates and identifies
   some of the main forms of appropriation of Polybius's ideas that have
   occurred in the West over the last 500 years. Secondly, it delineates
   the most important appropriation of Polybius in the human sciences that
   has been effected in recent times, namely the use made of Polybian
   themes by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri in Empire, their influential
   diagnosis of the contemporary state of world affairs. Thirdly, the
   article proffers a critique of these authors' use of Polybius, and in
   its stead offers an alternative mode of appropriation of his work for
   the purposes of analytically reorienting the human sciences in light of
   present-day concerns with globalization and conditions of globality. It
   is argued that, far from being a figure of only antiquarian interest,
   Polybius continues to be of much relevance for human scientists today,
   for he may be seen as a foundational figure in efforts to think about
   the `global' level in human affairs.}},

   potentially dangerous breast symptom relative to women without a
   ruminative style. In Study 1, 147 female ``ruminators{''} and
   ``non-ruminators{''} read a vignette in which they imagined they had

   Ruminators were significantly less likely to intend to call the doctor
   immediately after finding an imaginary breast lump than were
   non-ruminators. In Study 2, 70 women breast cancer survivors recalled
   the dates related to their symptom finding and their affective
   responses to symptom finding. Ruminators delayed the presentation of
   their breast cancer symptoms to a healthcare professional 39 days

   effects of ruminative style on delay appeared to be moderated in part

Abstract = {{Pygmies have long served, both in Western imagination and in Western
   science, as a sheet anchor for racial hierarchies and for putative
   sequences of human physical and social evolution. In the course of the
   late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Western exploration in
   Africa, Asia and the Pacific generated what might broadly be termed a
   colonial `Pygmy mythology', composed of a set of characteristics deemed
   diagnostic of this diminutive `race', articulated with an exceptional
   degree of confidence by travellers and metropolitan scientists alike.
   This paper charts the manner in which the three central tropes of
   racist denigration - the primordial, the infantile and the bestial -
   have been applied to excess in the description of Pygmies. Yet Pygmies
   have also been enlisted by colonial observers in an unlikely alliance,
   as third-party foils in arguments that seek to naturalize the
   conditions of colonial subjugation of non-Pygmy others. The impetus for
   this strange alliance is considered through reference to the recent
   re-discovery by the revisionist historian, Keith Windschuttle, of a
   Pygmy past in the rainforests of Queensland, Australia.}},

Abstract = {{In the late 1960s, artists world-wide turned to language and its
   related forms to devise a stylistic that would democratize artistic
   production. This essay examines the. deeper structure of belief that
   catalysed this `conceptual{''} aesthetic. Concurrently, structuralists
   argued that all human endeavours were inescapably governed by
   language's grid-like order, and that sociality could be mastered
   through a `science' of the signifier. Like artists, they looked to
   languaue for a revolution in signifying structures. Aesthetically and
   theoretically speaking, language had become the grid through which the
   world was pictured.
   This essay argues that we not only need to recover structuralism in
   order to truly understand Conceptualist aspirations and stratagems, we
   also need to reconsider this aesthetic for what it has to teach us
   about the fantasies that produced structuralism's ideals, the politics
   that grew up with those ideals, and, Surprisingly, the technological
   imaginary of its day. The word `information' emerges as the nodal point
   of this constellation. Through a close reading of MoMA's Information
   show (1970), this essay reveals that far from embracing the dream of
   the information world - a dream of the world as a total sign system,
   `revolutionary' perhaps, yet alienating of Subject and world - the
   visual arts expose its limitations.}},

Month = {{SUM}},
Abstract = {{In a recent essay, Carolyn Abbate argues for a ``drastic{''} rather
   than ``gnostic{''} conception of music and would want to see
   musicology's efforts redirected accordingly. In the wake of the 1985
   call by Joseph Kerman urging musicologists to shift their attention
   from ``positivism{''} and ``formalism{''} to ``criticism{''} or
   ``hermeneutics{''}-that is, to musicology centered on
   interpretation-Abbate issues a call for a new disciplinary revolution,
   one that would shift our attention from works to performances and thus
   undo what she perceives as the fatal weakness in Kerman's position.
   When we ignore the actually made and experienced sounding event in
   favor of the disembodied abstraction that is the work, we bypass the
   sensuous, audible, immediate experience (the ``drastic{''}) and put in
   its place the intellectual, supra-audible, mediated (that is,
   interpreted) meaning (the ``gnostic{''}) and thus avoid what is of real
   value in music-the experience, the powerful physical and spiritual
   impact it may have on us. While I am in fundamental sympathy with
   Abbate's arguments and aims, I believe that the opposition between the
   real performance and the imaginary work-the former the object of
   immediate, sensuous experience, the latter die vehicle of mediated
   (that is, interpreted, ``hermeneutic{''}) intellectual meaning-on which
   her argument rests is overdrawn: The hermeneutic element cannot be
   wholly banished from the arena of performance; there is no such thing
   as pure experience, uncontaminated by interpretation.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This article addresses and contests a particular narrative about the
   history of copyright law's engagement with music, an exemplary version
   of which is to be found in Lydia Goehr's highly influential The
   Imaginary Museum of Musical Works (1992). According to this narrative,
   copyright law's conception of the musical object that it protects by
   means of a property right derives from an aesthetic conception of the
   musical `work' that itself emerged from the field of musical practice,
   theory and criticism around 1800. Yet an analysis of the case law
   arising under the first modern copyright legislation of 1710 shows that
   copyright was recognized as vested in the composer of a musical
   `writing' as early as 1777 in England, and that an embryonic legal
   `work-concept' had already taken shape a decade or more earlier than
   that. This concept developed through a complex set of articulations
   between the doctrinal logic of property law and, especially, economic
   and aesthetic understandings of what a musical artefact was and where
   its value resided. However, far from simply absorbing aesthetic ideas
   about musical or other cultural practices, it is argued here that
   copyright's categories have developed relatively autonomously of these
   and other `external' influences. Further, being only relatively
   autonomous, they have also actively helped to shape what is assumed -
   by Goehr and other historians of culture - to have shaped them. In
   short, the central claim of this article is that the work done by
   intellectual property discourse in forging conceptions of cultural form
   has been significant and important, and that copyright doctrine has
   accordingly played a major role in producing that plural construct
   which is known as `the' musical work-concept.}},

   Written just five years after Zimbabwe became an independent nation,

   rethinks concepts of resistant agency that other critics of the novel

   Tambu is not a Western, creation, Western ideals of freedom and
   individuality cannot account for the heroic aspects of her behaviour.
   Reformulating Judith Butler's concept of subject formation, it develops
   ways of reading agency outside the binary logic of subordination and
   subversion, suggesting that agency develops unevenly on a continuum
   between complete compliance and complete resistance to norms. It also
   argues that spatial politics are crucial to Tambu's quest for
   intellectual subjectivity. Thus, Tambu reconstructs the daughter's

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. Occupational therapists are routinely involved in
   upper-extremity rehabilitation in persons with stroke. Recently we have
   reported that self-speech can be used to facilitate simple reach in
   young and older adults. The purpose of this study is to examine whether
   self-speech-induced facilitation of simple reach can be translated in
   persons with stroke.
   METHOD. Following a counterbalanced repeated-measure design, seven
   persons with right brain stroke performed reaching and placing a glass
   on a cabinet shelf under four concurrent speech conditions of
   vocalizing the word ``yeah{''} with both hemiplegic and nonhemiplegic
   sides. These four conditions are self-vocalization, external
   vocalization, imaginary vocalization, and no vocalization. Consistent
   with our previous study, in this study we also recorded the movement
   kinematics of angular movement of the upper arm.
   RESULTS. Reaching velocity was significantly higher under
   self-vocalization conditions compared to the reaching velocity under no
   vocalization or other vocalization conditions (p <.05). Motor
   performance in terms of velocity, nonhemiparetic side was significantly
   better than hemiparetic side (p <.05).
   CONCLUSION. The results suggest that self-speech can be used in
   facilitating movements in patients with stroke. When working with
   patients with right hemispheric stroke, therapists might explore
   possibilities of using patient's self-speech to enhance the quality of
   movement performance.}},

Abstract = {{The real, thought of as human reality, that is, a mixture of the
   imaginary, mythology, emotions, flesh, passions, suffering, love, is
   always surprising, full of possibilities and hard to grasp. A thinking
   adapted to the complex reality of our earthly homeland cannot be a
   trivial realism content with the established order and accepting the
   victory of the victorious. On the contrary, understanding of reality,
   lucidity are often the result of an ethical revolt against the fait
   accompli, against certainty. The thinking suggested by Morin attempts
   to move beyond the alternatives between, on the one hand, the worst
   option: the utopia that thinks it is realistic, and on the other the
   utopia that knows it is utopia, and is therefore harmless, outside the
   real. The hope is to introduce the poetry of intensity into reality, to
   resist the oppressive forces of pseudo-realism by cultivating the
   garden of our earthly homeland.}},

Abstract = {{Objectified body consciousness (OBC)-the tendency to view oneself as an

   terms, extant research has examined primarily the experiences of
   undergraduates and adults. Our goal in this study was to develop an
   age-appropriate measure to allow study of OBC development during
   preadolescence and adolescence. We modeled the OBC-Youth after McKinley
   and Hyde's (1996) OBC-Classic to measure three components of OBC: body
   surveillance, body shame, and appearance control beliefs. The 14-item
   scale contains modified vocabulary and syntax to make it appropriate
   for use with preadolescent and adolescent youth. Results indicate that
   the OBC-Youth scale is a reliable, valid Measure of OBC. initial
   findings about the correlates of OBC in preadolescence are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of seeking an optimal parking policy is formulated here as

   parking policies, the proposed game includes an explicit quantitative
   formulation of the governmental objective. Each traveler wishes to gain
   a maximum utility from his choice of destination and transportation
   mode, and the choice distribution of all travelers is obtained by Logit
   model. A fundamental difference exists between Game Theory practice and
   common assumptions used in transportation modeling regarding the
   relationship between a single traveler's utility and the choice
   distribution of all travelers. This difference is tackled here through
   the definition of the player that represents the travelers and its
   objective function. A simple version of the game is tested in 24
   imaginary scenarios of transportation and urban conditions.}},

   differ between Pretend and Reality tasks, suggesting that young

Month = {{FAL}},
Abstract = {{This article explores and explains August Halm's and Heinrich
   Schenker's differing opinions of Brahms and Bruckner based on Halm's
   notions of corporeality and spirituality, body and soul, in music, and
   on differences in symphonic style between the two composers.
   Corporeality manifests itself in thematic gestures whose contours trace
   distinctive shapes in music's imaginary space, resulting in the
   impression of depth, something metaphorically tangible. When the
   dynamic course of a passage is clearly manifest in the aural immediacy
   of its rhythmic and thematic gestures, Halm acknowledges its
   corporeality (Korperlichkeit). When a work's dynamic course is
   concealed or musically too subtle to be readily perceived, it
   exemplifies a different quality, spirituality (Geistigkeit), which
   resides in between the notes and occurs, so to speak, subterraneously.
   Schenker's Urlinie was thus for Halm a case of unnecessarily
   ``spiritualizing the spiritual yet again.{''}
   Halm's advocacy for Bruckner's symphonies as marking the beginning of
   ``a new era and culture{''} was incomprehensible for Schenker, who
   conceded to Bruckner only a ``very modest power of invention.{''}
   Schenker's unqualified enthusiasm for Brahms, on the other hand, the
   ``last master of German composition,{''} gave Halm a ``painful
   jolt.{''} ForHalm, Bruckner is a ``cosmic epicist,{''} for Schenker
   ``too much a foreground composer. `` Letters between Schenker and Halm
   as well as other, hitherto unknown archival materials among Halm's
   estate papers delineate Halm's views in contrast to those of Schenker.}},

Abstract = {{Peter's Lynd's article,Time and Classical and Quantum Mechanics:
   Indeterminancy vs. Discontinuity{''} published in Foundations of
   Physics Letters in 2003 made quite a buzz not only in academia but also
   attracted attention of leading media around the globe. Lynd's ideas
   about indeterminancy of motion were regarded by some as one of the
   greatest discoveries in problematics of space and time since Einstein.
   My article examines the importance and originality of P. Lynd's ideas.
   In the first part of it, the general principal of indeterminancy of
   motion is discussed. Special emphasis is made on instant - interval
   issue as well as Lynd's critics of concept of imaginary time. Second
   part of the article is based on Lynd's paper ``Zeno's Paradoxes: A
   Timely Solution{''}. Through short analysis of historical solutions of
   Zeno's paradoxes it is shown that Lynd's proposed solution is
   insufficient. At the same time a new way of solving ``Achiles and
   Tortoise{''} paradox is presented. Finally, conclusions of the article
   reveal that although Lynd's articles are interesting as philosophical
   speculations, they are far from introducing revolutionary concepts of
   space and time.}},

Journal = {{REVUE DU NORD}},

Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{360-61}},
Pages = {{529+}},
Month = {{APR-SEP}},
Abstract = {{The first half of the XIXth century was rich in written productions
   which claimed openly to be heirs to the Voyage Pittoresque or which
   borrowed all or part of its particular features; a genre set by its
   very vicinity with local statistics at the crossroads of the
   contradictions of a time torn apart between the obsessive regret of
   things past and the feverish expectation of the fulfilment of the
   promises of the future. The study of the ways in which a picturesque
   North situates itself within the Romantic imaginary lore rests on the
   taking into account of two types of writings.
   The first, confining themselves to the labelling of the Voyages
   Pittoresques produced by local and regional scholars, inscribe the
   inventory of the interesting sites in the hackneyed figures of the
   descriptive literature of the time: the Nord picturesque only appears
   as one of the versions of a departmental picturesque that can be
   indefinitely declined from one end of the country to the other end,
   staged along identical procedures, sending the reader, secure in the
   posture of the learned person, the same signals.
   The second, which belong more directly to the travel narrative in the
   proper sense - remarks scattered along the family correspondence as
   such is the case for Victor Hugo's 1837 travel in Northern France and
   in Belgium, or extracted from a Journal like Michelet's - yield
   themselves to quite different an approach to the notion: the routes
   which, in these precise cases, structure the construction of the
   regional image authorize the graded assessment of a picturesque in
   comparison with the standard of what imposes itself, in the 1830-1840
   decade, as the focal point of the imaginary historical lore: the
   reference to Flanders. In the game of a Michelet who considers the Nord
   countryside as a mirror image of Antwerp landscape paintings as much as
   in the game of a Hugo who, after the dazzlement experienced in Brussels
   in 1837, carves himself an aesthetic model of the northern town, one
   can read the processes through which they build the image of a
   ``Nord{''} whose picturesque would be something like the ultimate
   avatar of the local colour, a notion that, in this early XIXth century,
   is being shaped in Augustin Thierry's writings.
   It is thus in this tension between a conventional picturesque and a
   picturesque inscribed within the regional particularities that one must
   situate this analysis of the system of representations of the Nord that
   are induced, in the Romantic period, by the learned forms of travelling.}},

   the picture of a North attached to the ceremonials of entrances as
   means to demonstrate its fidelity to a centralized power. Then, through
   the organization of the costly festive events and the large scale
   mobilization of all the local skills, one can gradually make out the
   image of a welcoming and attractive North. This appeal through the
   display of farm products and the litany of industrial shows confirms
   the theme of prosperity that will assert itself in the region's

   Leipzig review, ``Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung{''}. There he issued
   his short story, Der Besuch im Irrenhause ({''}A Visit to an
   Asylum{''}), which can be regarded as a pivotal work in the field of
   writings on the Romantic musician myth, as well among those relating
   art to madness. In fact, its most original aspect is its tight music -
   madness link - a novelty in those times - functioning as a Leitmotiv.
   Der Besuch im Irrenhause, sub-tided ``An Essay in Psychology{''},
   depicts a scientific experiment. The narrator is an amateur
   psychologist. While touring an insane asylum, he is struck by a young
   inmate who withdrew from the real world to live in a personal one,
   mostly made of sounds and musical visions. Music, the language of heart
   and soul, gradually rises up to the role of ideal mean for inner
   expression. The act of listening implies transport and ecstasy, a
   journey in a fantasy world conjured up by sounds, and the vehicle to
   rise up to God. Music is seen as the ``language of angels and blessed
   spirits{''}, the sacred art par excellence, and the route to grasp the
   deep unity of the universe. Yet music will also drive the main
   character to madness, with mystic visions, imaginary dialogues, and
   raving.
   For sure, this work is interesting as a forerunner of several topics
   subsequently seized up by a whole generation of writers, musicians, and
   thinkers - the upcoming Romantic movement. Rochlitz's short story
   stands tall in its times, on a par with the best work by Wackenroder,
   Hoffmann, and Grillparzer. It is all the more interesting for its
   creator was no Romantic writer, but rather an 18th-century thinker,
   rooted in the Enlightenment, its views, and its values. Today, Rochlitz
   is an unduly neglected figure, whereas in his days he exerted vast
   influence in the German-speaking area.}},

Abstract = {{The most taboo of perversions, necrophilia, is often incorporated into
   Decadent fiction as a theme testifying to the strength of a passion
   that defies corruption and endures everlastingly. In contrast to these
   elegiac celebrations of indestructible love, Rachilde's 1899 novel La
   Tour d'amour reintroduces the intense biological horror, the terrible
   sexual transgressivity of genuine necrophilia. Additionally, through a
   remarkable process of imaginary doubling, Rachilde uses her novel to
   stage a split in her authorial persona. Casting the helpless novice
   writer she was at the start of her career as the female corpse
   exploited by a pseudonymous male writer, she assumes the aggressive
   role in preying on her status as a victim. She thereby transforms
   herself into the necrophilic criminal whose violence is creatively
   reutilized as the shocking subjects of her books.}},

Abstract = {{Concerning the problem of the supply of public goods the logic of the
   utilitarian action model produces a dilemma: on the one hand, a market
   failure appears in regard to their supply within the scope of this
   model; on the other hand, the theoretical model assumptions make the
   only solution - that the state has to provide for such goods - seem
   ineffective (state failure). The solution offered in the framework of a
   ``constitutional political economy,{''} according to which the same
   social mechanism must become effective as in the conclusion of an
   imaginary social contract, will ultimately result in a ``prisoner's
   dilemma{''} due to the actors' lacking value commitment. This
   consequence can be avoided in the frame of reference of classical
   political economy, because here individual utility orientation and
   normative value commitments do not exclude each other, so that the
   actors are able to overcome the dilemma. As a result, value commitments
   must be taken into account alongside market, state, and community as
   central mechanisms in the coordination of social action. However, such
   pure mechanisms of action coordination condense empirically into a
   complicated manner of coordination.}},

   included in the study. It is shown that the 1955 space is characterized
   by a greater contrast between agonistic and non-agonistic universes,
   and a firmer gendering of these oppositions. Other results include a
   confirmation of the generally accepted intuition that first novelists
   tend to reproduce features of their own social and geographical
   background in their works, but it is argued that different ``site

Volume = {{59}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Study objective: Using a conceptual rather than a mathematical
   approach, this article proposed a link between multilevel regression
   analysis (MLRA) and social epidemiological concepts. It has been
   previously explained that the concept of clustering of individual
   health status within neighbourhoods is useful for operationalising
   contextual phenomena in social epidemiology. It has been shown that
   MLRA permits investigating neighbourhood disparities in health without
   considering any particular neighbourhood characteristic but only
   information on the neighbourhood to which each person belongs. This
   article illustrates how to analyse cross level
   (neighbourhood-individual) interactions, how to investigate
   associations between neighbourhood characteristics and individual
   health, and how to use the concept of clustering when interpreting
   those associations and geographical differences in health.
   Design and participants: A MLRA was performed using hypothetical data
   pertaining to systolic blood pressure (SBP) from 25 000 subjects living
   in the 39 neighbourhoods of an imaginary city. Associations between
   individual characteristics (age, body mass index (BMI), use of
   antihypertensive drug, income) or neighbourhood characteristic
   (neighbourhood income) and SBP were analysed.
   Results: About 8\% of the individual differences in SBP were located at
   the neighbourhood level. SBP disparities and clustering of individual
   SBP within neighbourhoods increased along individual BMI. Neighbourhood
   low income was associated with increased SBP over and above the effect
   of individual characteristics, and explained 22\% of the neighbourhood
   differences in SBP among people of normal BMI. This neighbourhood
   income effect was more intense in overweight people.
   Conclusions: Measures of variance are relevant to understanding
   geographical and individual disparities in health, and complement the
   information conveyed by measures of association between neighbourhood
   characteristics and health.}},

Abstract = {{The article considers how Tim Blake Nelson's ``O{''}-filmed in the

   transforming film audiences into endangered beings-inseparable from

   do nothing less than help them to stay alive. The piece examines the

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{SUM}},
Abstract = {{Adorno's ``Schubert{''} textually reenacts what he recognizes in
   Schubert's music, repeating himself but with subtle differences, as
   though he were holding up a cut gem to light and turning it to see the
   differences manifested in its facets. Adorno's ideas about this music
   are less developed than juxtaposed, often paratactically, so as to
   constitute what Benjamin termed a constellation. What Adorno hears in
   Schubert is a kind of reciprocity toward otherness. Schubert's
   ``landscape,{''} for Adorno, is grounded in the realm of the cultural
   imaginary; it represents for him a declaration of love, defined by the
   difference between subject and object that engenders embrace, rather
   than domination. The aesthetic truth of Schubert's music doesn't emerge
   through development, except, ironically perhaps, in the
   ``successful{''} failure of his developments. Instead, it's articulated
   in a virtual instant, as in the shape and turn of a melody (and
   distinctly not in its working out). The Schubert melody is like the
   imagined perfection of landscape-as though, like ``nature,{''} it were
   always already complete. The C-minor Andante of the Piano Trio in E
   (op. 100, D. 929) is a case in point. The opening melodic statement in
   the cello and the folklike second theme in the violin, for the most
   part, can only be repeated, not improved upon, though Schubert
   tries-the melodic perfection of the opening statements, the first theme
   especially, becomes unambiguously evident only when the movement ends.
   We need everything that follows the initial statements to realize what
   we first heard: a melody (more than a theme) complete in itself,
   perfect, and on that account acoustically utopian-a semblance of
   happiness embedded in the sad honesty of C-minor's pensive melancholy.}},

   a rational knowledge only using his mind and according with the

   naturalize the `spatial story' of imperialism during the period when
   South Africa was emerging as a modern, autonomous nation. A recurring

   bodily subjectivity towards landscape, while at the same time
   incorporating the new nation's physiographic regions into a
   historically and geographically-legible whole. The Cape-to-Rand railway
   journey became a discursive trope in which culturally-constructed ideas

Abstract = {{Many migration studies emphasize the settlement process and more
   recently transnational attachments and identities, but less
   consideration is given to the idea of return. This article focuses on
   first-generation Guatemalans and Salvadorans in the United States and
   examines the varying degrees of migrants' desires to return home versus
   actual return. Specifically, the paper highlights the persistence among
   these migrants, who live and work in Phoenix, Arizona, of a
   ``diasporic{''} or ``transnational{''} tendency to think of home. This
   emphasis is important because we do not assume that migrants have
   clear-cut options about their migration movements. Additionally, it
   allows us to consider migrants' social imaginary - the divergent ways
   in which men and women in our study imagine their return and express
   their intents to return, which in turn, may influence their responses
   toward migration. For heuristic reasons, we identify three distinct
   conceptual categories of longings to return - assertive, ambivalent,
   and no desire to return. Drawing from narratives of Guatemalan and
   Salvadoran migrants' experiences in Phoenix gathered through in-depth
   interviews, the paper reveals that all three kinds of expressions
   outlined demonstrate the significance that the location of immediate
   family, particularly children, seems to have in ultimately shaping
   longings to return back home. These considerations highlight the
   fundamentally social nature of immigrants' seemingly most individual
   motivations and desires - to return or to stay.}},

Abstract = {{Fear of the `Fifth Column' was one of the most important aspects of the
   defeat suffered by the British army in France and Belgium during May
   and June 1940, but it has so far been largely overlooked in most
   accounts of the campaign. There was widespread paranoia throughout the
   British Expeditionary Force that its efforts were being undermined by
   spies, traitors and saboteurs, all working behind the lines to deliver
   a fatal `stab in the back' to British forces. This paper suggests that
   this feature of the experience of retreat is a fundamental issue. It
   argues that many of the other notable facets of the retreat - the
   strained relationship with allies, the problems in dealing with
   civilians, the deterioration of morale - can be better understood
   within the context of the widespread fear of the `Fifth Column'.
   Furthermore, it argues that there was a disintegration and
   brutalization of relationships with civilians, refugees and allies as a
   direct result of `Fifth Column' paranoia. It concludes that although
   the actual influence of any Fifth Column was probably insignificant,
   the British army suffered far greater damage from the phantom menace of
   its imaginary'Fifth Column'.}},

Abstract = {{Recent publications by Charles Taylor (Varieties of Religion Today,
   Modern Social Imaginaries) have considered the meaning of religion in
   modern secularized society, especially with regard to the construction
   of political identities. This critical study points to an inconsistency
   in Taylors approach to religion. In his criticism of William James' The
   Varieties of Religious Experience, Taylor argues that James' conception
   is one-sided: it overlooks a crucial feature of Catholicism, the need
   namely for a mediation of the divine. James' conception of religion, on
   the contrary, starts from individual experience. In Taylors description
   of the development of the relation between politics and religion,
   however, this critical attitude seems to vanish. Instead of working out
   a political philosophy, Taylor hides himself behind sociological and
   historical considerations. The paper argues that a political philosophy
   should be mindful of the consequences of Taylors remarks in the field
   of the philosophy of religion. In order to do this, use is made of Carl
   Schmitt's notion of `political theology' and his thesis concerning the
   ``anti-Roman affect{''} in the political history of the West. Any
   political philosophy that is prepared to consider the relations between
   `politics' and `religion' should take into account the varieties of
   religion and their impact on politics.}},

Abstract = {{The leading hypothesis for the analysis of the novel The Knife, by Vuk
   Draskovitch, establishes links among the concepts of procreation,

   kinship make up a framework for the notions of ethnic and national

   national identities which, driven by political and armed conflicts,
   nurture genocide. While in fiction the idea of Serbia is built upon the
   family history of two characters as well as references to a remote
   past, in real fact the idea of Serbia as a political entity was
   constructed in opposition to the Muslim community of Kosovo, the
   autonomous region of Serbia. This nationalistic vision of the past
   highlights the victimization and suffering of the Serbian people.
   Before Tito's death, such construction of ``memory{''} would have been

   move `from control to commitment', then through critical accounts

   nature of resistance. This history and its various puzzling inversions
   are then reviewed through Lacan's account of the `imaginary', and
   Butler's associated re-reading of oedipal identifications. These offer
   an account both of the constitution of a humanist, interiorized sense
   of self-of the self as a discrete, autonomous, independent entity-as
   well as of the illusions or misunderstandings of this humanist
   conception of the self. It is suggested that the Power of the imaginary
   lies in the power of recognition and the way in which this acts as a
   lure or trap in which we seek and find ourselves. It is this desire for
   existence confirming recognition that founds our interest in the
   control of others and leaves us vulnerable to control by others.
   Understanding the misrecognition involved in such processes of

Abstract = {{Structuralism is used here in a broad sense. It includes the works of
   Levi-Strauss and Barthes as well as Althusser Lacan and Foucault. I see
   it, not as a system or a school, but as a movement, and I include
   post-structuralism (Derrida or Deleuze) within the scope of
   structuralism itself, as a definite negation of certain initial
   assumptions. I defend the thesis that Structuralism was not
   characterized by its objectivist stance, or its refusal to acknowledge
   the importance of the category of the Subject, but by its renewed
   effort at producing a genesis or construction of the subject within
   transindividual structures, therefore viewing it as a complex system of
   effects rather than an originary cause. This conversion form the
   constituent to the constituted subject explains the importance of the
   linguistic, psycho-analytical and anthropological models, but also of a
   certain understanding of Marxism as a theory of the social imaginary.
   Post-structuralism displays a second internal movement, whereby the
   limits of subjectivity (particularly inasmuch as they involve a
   dissolution of the normality of the structures and a reflection on the
   violence of the constitution process) are presented in terms of pure
   differences involving both activity and passivity. It is this second
   movement which contributes decisively to grant structuralism, not only
   an epistemological, but also an ethical philosophical relevance.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Functional MRI studies have begun to identify neural
   networks implicated in visuo-spatial working memory in healthy
   volunteers and patients with schizophrenia. The study of schizotypal
   personality disorder (SPD) provides regional analysis in unmedicated
   patients in the schizophrenia spectrum.
   Method. Unmedicated patients with SPD by DSM-IV criteria and normal
   controls were assessed with fMRI while performing a visuospatial
   working-memory task. It required the subjects to retain the location of
   three dots located on the circumference of an imaginary circle and then
   respond to a query display in which one dot was presented and the
   subject required to press a button to indicate whether the probe dot
   location was previously displayed. Subject groups did not differ
   significantly in spatial memory scores. The exact Talairach and
   Tournoux coordinates of brain areas previously reported to show
   activation with spatial memory tasks were assessed.
   Results. The majority of these locations showed BOLD response
   activation significantly less in patients during the memory retention
   period, including the left ventral prefrontal cortex, superior frontal
   gyrus, intraparietal cortex and posterior inferior gyrus. Regions in
   the right middle prefrontal and prestriate cortex showed greater
   activation at a trend level for patients with SPD than for normal
   controls. In addition, we replicated the findings of increased
   activation with the task in healthy volunteers in the premotor areas,
   ventral prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex.
   Conclusions. SPD patients show decreased activation compared to healthy
   volunteers in key frontal regions and we also provided a partial
   replication of findings reported in healthy subjects.}},

Abstract = {{A salient feature of clinical anxiety and its disorders is an elevated
   subjective probability judgement that future negative events will
   happen to the individual. A neglected area of research is the cognitive
   mechanisms that might underlie this judgement in patient populations.
   First, we investigated the ease of being able to simulate imaginary
   negative events happening to the individual ('the simulation
   heuristic'). Second, we conducted the first investigation to our
   knowledge into the possible role of visual imagery characteristics on
   subjective probability for negative events. Twenty-six patients who had
   a clinical level of anxiety and 26 low-anxiety control participants
   simulated mentally and also formed visual images of future negative
   events. They then rated the likelihood of the events happening to them.
   As predicted, with anxious patients the simulation heuristic was
   correlated with subjective probability, and they reported increased
   access to their simulations compared to control participants. The
   visual image results were more complex: anxious patients' ease of image
   formation was correlated with subjective probability but did not differ
   from that of the control participants, and vividness and dismissibility
   were enhanced in anxious patients but did not correlate with subjective
   probability. Clinically, helping anxious patients to improve their
   access to simulations of why events will not happen may help lower
   their subjective probability. Future research could seek to confirm
   this experimentally in a clinical intervention study, as well as
   isolate further the different roles particular visual image
   characteristics may play in specific aspects of clinical anxiety.

Abstract = {{The theory of conspiracy, that is, the idea that national problems are
   due to the plots of certain social and political groups, usually

   the images that appeared in El Hijo del Ahuizote, a popular Mexican

   created a certain image of the gachupin, as well as some peculiarities

   complex relations btween the Mexican imaginary and anything related to

Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{79+}},
Abstract = {{If we investigate the concept of the universality of human rights, we
   realize that it is limited and invalid, and that it fails because it is
   too utopian and unreal. It is not a question of denying that there is a
   generic human essence, or criticizing human rights from a moral
   standpoint, but of showing that `human rights' do not really have a
   universal basis. They are a part of history, and as such they vary
   according to societies and develop differently across space, time and
   moment. The values that underlie human rights are relative and
   evolving. They take distinctive forms according to cultures and social
   context, and are likely to be modified according to societies and
   periods. In other words, in this area there is no universal societal
   code that would be approved and recognized everywhere. Therefore the
   statement of rights cannot fail to be marked by their context. Each
   civilization has its codes and keywords influenced by its
   Weltanschauung. This paper attempts to place human rights texts in
   their historical and geographical context, and thereby demonstrate that
   there is nothing constant about them. They are dependent on cultures
   and collective imaginaries, national representations and social
   determinants, and rely heavily on their instrumentalization by states.
   For this reason we need to rethink the relationship between the
   particular and the universal in order to widen their humanistic base.}},

   made use of the multifaceted concept of ilusion through an analysis of
   the four interludes that center on a hoax. Although the element of play
   and the concept of ``illusion{''} clearly serve as a theoretical
   support for all dramatic literature, what we find in Cervantes's
   interludes is a masterful blend of these ludic ingredients that come
   together to stage forms of reality that reflect the social imaginary of
   seventeenth-century Spain, as well as the human condition. The social
   imaginary in these pieces consists of an endless series of hopes and
   expectations, continually executed through the Cervantine play of
   ``engano a los ojos.{''} Ultimately, these pieces represent the
   never-ending reading/writing of a never-ending action, an ilusion in
   the ``negative{''} sense (i.e., deception) that ultimately imbues the
   reader/spectator with the ``positive{''} sense (i.e., hope,

   answer is surprising and logical: he places the typical rules and plot

   fantastic topography balances out the inequalities of the courtly
   world, which were at the centre of Hartmann's Arthurian romances, as a

Abstract = {{This response to Peter Marcuse situates his reading of the World Social
   Forum in the larger, `space versus movement' debate that has been
   raging among the WSF's organizers. The author argues that this debate
   signals: (1) a power struggle over its future; (2) profound
   disagreement over the character of its power, which is itself based in
   conflicting understandings and visions of power and change in the
   contemporary period more generally; (3) at the heart of this last
   conflict is a yet more basic one about the status of multiplicity and
   diversity - in understanding power(s), in building resistance(s), in
   creating alternatives, in crafting solidarities, in imagining other
   possible worlds as les raisons d'etre of the Social Forum. Drawing on
   the historical experience of feminism, the author proposes an
   alternative reading of the meaning of the Social Forum grounded in more
   multivalent understandings of power, movements and change, and argues
   that, in the evolving practice of the World Social Forum, a new
   democratic imaginary - post-liberal and post-Marxist - is taking shape
   and, with it, other possible futures are coming into view.}},

Abstract = {{This article is concerned with didactic hoaxes that are constructed to
   discredit their targets; the underlying question is whether a poetry
   hoax can do this. I compare the Sokal hoax with the Ern Malley hoax: in
   the first case (USA, 1996), an NYU physicist, Alan Sokal, wrote a bogus
   article claiming that the laws of physics should be seen as social
   constructs; in the second case (Australia, 1943) two poets, James
   McAuley and Harold Stewart, concocted the poems of an imaginary
   modernist, Ern Malley. In both cases the hoaxers realized their aim:
   Social Text, the magazine that published Sokal's article, and Angry
   Penquins, the magazine that celebrated the poems of Ern Malley, looked
   foolish. However, while the physics that Sokal used was bogus, what
   McAuley and Stewart had intentionally tried to write as bad poetry now
   reads as lively, comic and inventive. The poetry of ``Ern Malley{''}
   now generates more interest than the genuine poetry of McAuley and
   Stewart. Thus, while Malley is a hoax-poet, it doesn't seem that the
   hoaxers succeeded in writing hoax-poetry.}},

Journal = {{NEOPHILOLOGUS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{221-233}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Rimbaud's ``Enfance{''} depicts the passage during childhood from a
   marvelous state of selfless absorption in the world through a process
   of individuation that parallels the theory of ``le stade du miroir{''}
   proposed by Lacan and later developed by Kristeva. In part one, the
   child is a feminized object of feminine attention, bathing in a
   semiotic flux of prelinguistic images and sounds. This fragmented
   immersion in the Lacanian imaginary is disrupted by the child's
   recognition of a reflected self-image that is complete and apart,
   initiating the process of differentiation. The passage into the
   symbolic is signaled by the death of the mother and entry into the
   masculine world of ``differance,{''} dominated by the ``general,{''}
   who commands the patriarchy in the name of the father. Next, a series
   of objective anaphoras emphasizing the otherness of things signifies
   the child's accession to language. A second anaphoric series repeatedly
   asserts a fully self-conscious ``Je{''} against the backdrop of an
   ever-receding objective world. This presages the demise of childhood,
   implied by the subject's withdrawal into the tomb. The poem concludes
   with a sense of bitterness and ambivalence, as the paranoid subject
   vacillates between rejection of the castrating social imperative of the
   symbolic and a desire for the linguistic mastery it affords.}},

Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Study objective: ( 1) To provide a didactic and conceptual ( rather
   than mathematical) link between multilevel regression analysis (MLRA)
   and social epidemiological concepts. ( 2) To develop an epidemiological
   vision of MLRA focused on measures of health variation and clustering
   of individual health status within areas, which is useful to
   operationalise the notion of ``contextual phenomenon''. The paper shows
   how to investigate ( 1) whether there is clustering within
   neighbourhoods, ( 2) to which extent neighbourhood level differences
   are explained by the individual composition of the neighbourhoods, ( 3)
   whether the contextual phenomenon differs in magnitude for different
   groups of people, and whether neighbourhood context modifies individual
   level associations, and ( 4) whether variations in health status are
   dependent on individual level characteristics.
   Design and participants: Simulated data are used on systolic blood
   pressure (SBP), age, body mass index (BMI), and antihypertensive
   medication (AHM) ascribed to 25 000 subjects in 39 neighbourhoods of an
   imaginary city. Rather than assessing neighbourhood variables, the
   paper concentrated on SBP variance between individuals and
   neighbourhoods as a function of individual BMI.
   Results: The variance partition coefficient (VPC) showed that
   clustering of SBP within neighbourhoods was greater for people with a
   higher BMI. The composition of the neighbourhoods with respect to age,
   AHM use, and BMI explained about one fourth of the neighbourhood
   differences in SBP. Neighbourhood context modified the individual level
   association between BMI and SBP. Individual level differences in SBP
   within neighbourhoods were larger for people with a higher BMI.
   Conclusions: Statistical measures of multilevel variations can
   effectively quantify contextual effects in different groups of people,
   which is a relevant issue for understanding health inequalities.}},

   out the transitive power that fiction exerts on its audience, and(in
   the wake of M.R. Jung's studies) stresses the significance of metaphor
   in the translation of pagan myth into Christian parable. As they throw
   bridges to Biblical imaginary representations, metaphors facilitates a
   shift from ancient to Christian tradition. Ovide moralise was written
   by a << preacher >> with a wide knowledge of doctrine; as such it
   represents a rich starting point from which to explore the significance
   of readers' profiles for the interpretation of a text (Wolfgang Iser's

Abstract = {{Objective: The goal of this study was to ascertain preferences for
   end-of-life care among persons with serious mental illness. Methods:
   The participants were 150 community-residing adults with serious mental
   illness. The Health Care Preferences Questionnaire was administered to
   obtain information about treatment preferences in response to
   hypothetical medical illness scenarios: use of pain medication in the
   case of incurable cancer and use of artificial life support in the case
   of irreversible coma. Participants were asked what their treatment
   preferences would be for an imaginary person in each scenario
   ({''}other{''}) as well as their preferences for themselves
   ({''}self{''}). Results: For the scenario involving pain medication for
   incurable cancer, most participants chose aggressive pain management
   even if cognition might be affected ( 64 percent of respondents under
   the ``other{''} scenario and 66 percent under the ``self{''} scenario).
   Few participants thought a doctor should provide patients with enough
   medication to end their life ( 34 percent for self and 24 percent for
   other). For the scenario involving irreversible coma, respondents were
   divided in their choice regarding life support. Approximately
   one-quarter said that they would prefer to immediately terminate life
   support ( 28 percent of respondents for other and 29 percent for self),
   and half said they would choose to turn it off after a defined period (
   48 percent for other and 45 percent for self). Conclusions: Persons
   with serious mental illness were able to designate treatment
   preferences in response to end-of-life health state scenarios. Future
   research is needed to test advance care planning methods, assess
   stability of choices over time, and ascertain the utility of
   scenario-based preferences to guide end-of-life care decisions in this
   population.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces some concepts for analysing scalar aspects of
   governance, governance failure, and meta-governance. There is now a
   significant corpus of work on multi-level governance in the European
   Union as well as an enormous literature on various modes of governance.
   Although the problem of scale is often posed directly for the EU case
   (notably in terms of the `multi-level' character of its political
   regime), scalar issues are also important for all forms of governance.
   For effective governance must take account of the specific
   spatio-temporalities of its objects and mechanisms as well as the
   spatio-temporal location and horizons of action of the subjects
   involved in its exercise. In particular, among their other relational
   properties, the objects of governance are more or less embedded in
   space, place, and scale and linked to distinctive temporal relations
   and emergent temporalities. This indicates the relevance of a
   strategic-relational concern with space, place and scale, with spatial,
   local and scalar imaginaries, and with attempts to secure
   spatio-temporal fixes to facilitate the reproduction of objects of
   governance. Given space constraints, I focus here on two sets of
   issues: (i) theoretically, the role of scale, scalar divisions of
   labour, the relativisation of scale, and multi-scalar governance; and
   (ii) substantively, the now paradigmatic case of the European Union as
   a novel form of multi-scalar meta-governance.}},

Abstract = {{With reference to the theoretical controversy about gender-specific
   humour this essay intends to explore the various expressions of female
   humour in Sylvia Townsend Warners novel Lolly Willowes. On the
   understanding that the established studies of humour have traditionally

   either disregarded or belittled female humour, this essay illustrates
   how the subversive tendencies of female comedy have worked out comical
   effects different from those of male writings, and consequently require
   different standards of criticism. In Lolly Willowes, a novel which
   continuously oscillates between realism and the imaginary, the obscure
   laughter accordingly manifests itself as `giggling' and therefore (in
   the terms of Plessner) marks an indefinable `space between.' The
   reader's comic sensations, stimulated by this muted laughter, originate
   less from the traditional effects of comedy such as burlesque
   comparisons, or the comical effects of the unexpected, but much rather
   from a thrilling and tickling awareness of insecurity.}},

Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{179-211}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{E.D.E.N. Southworth's originally massively popular novel The Hidden
   Hand (1859), was not published as a book until it had undergone
   serialization three separate times, over the course of a course of a
   quarter century, in a weekly story-paper called the New York Ledger.
   This bare fact about the material form in which it circulated and
   gained its large and admiring audience has consequences for
   interpreting the novel that have gone entirely unexamined by scholars.
   Thus, Southworth's novel offers a good test for the claim that the
   material form of publication (in this case, periodical serialization)
   is a substantively important aspect of the work's meaning: the readers
   who responded to it so enthusiastically had all read it under the
   conditions of seriality. In this essay I attempt to take account of the
   interpretive implications of seriality for understanding Southworth's
   novel, exploring some of the ways in which it was ideologically
   embedded in the Ledger and describing the active and canny role it
   played in that periodical apoliticism. The Hidden Hand embodies the
   magazine's declared nonpartisanship in, among other things, various
   forms of generic melding and imaginary scenarios of sectional
   unification. Critical accounts that have sought to characterize this
   novel as proslavery or antislavery have all missed the points that
   Southworth's tale actively ignores such political issues and thus
   sought to transcend the dire sectional controversies that were
   unmistastakably impending at the time of its publication.}},

   Winckelmann portrays the insignificance of the cultural setting within
   which his academic socialisation took place - in other words, the lack
   of aesthetic offerings in the city and university of Halle - with such
   scathing accuracy that this connoisseur of fine art who was trained in
   Rome seems to become a stranger and exile in his own time and place. In
   contrast to this, the imaginary, classical art-world of Rome appears to
   be the natural home of aesthetic scholars. The Roman ideal, however,
   does not replace Halle and the German academy - it remains instead the
   measure by which both are judged. This interaction between one's own
   present reality and alterity opens up various possibilities for a gain
   in self-knowledge. Moreover, the destruction of the present contains a
   subtle salvation for the same.}},

   characterised by a reliance on fantasy, which manifests itself in the
   major role played by the imaginary in their daily lives. Such people
   inhabit a world in which fantasy and the imagination occupy a central
   place, and notably tend to compensate for their often unsatisfying
   affective lives and disappointments by constructing a parallel world.
   They are also markedly prone to acquiring psychosomatic disorders,
   which are largely the product of their imagination. The origins of the
   very easily hypnotisable personality lie in childhood, and take root in
   one of two ways. The first involves the very early familiarisation of
   the child with games requiring an exercise of the imagination, as a
   result of a parent encouraging this type of activity. The second is
   characterised by a defensive reaction against a hostile environment,
   commonly involving childhood abuse, where the child resorts to flights
   of fantasy as the only means of escaping from his powerlessness. These
   studies therefore tend to indicate that there is an indirect link
   between hypnosis and psychopathological troubles of a hysterical
   nature, which rests on a common feature : fantasy. The shared
   characteristic of the very easily hypnotisable personality and persons
   presenting psychopathological problems would be their exercise of the
   imagination, which the former rely on in responding to hypnotic
   suggestion, the latter in producing pathological symptoms. If the
   presence of problems of a hysterical type or of multiple personality
   syndrome very likely signifies a high susceptibility to hypnosis, the
   inverse does not hold: The majority of highly imaginative and very
   easily hypnotisable subjects do not exhibit any psychological problems.
   The fact that Charcot and Janet regarded susceptibility to hypnosis as
   a pathological phenomenon is therefore apparently explained by the
   nature of their clientele, which consisted exclusively of patients with
   psychological problems, notably cases of major hysteria. This
   population proved to be particularly easy to hypnotize and represented
   the pathological facet of a wider, pathologically normal population.

Abstract = {{Inescapably, comic book versions of Shakespeare's plays not only
   inform, but also interpret, verbally and visually, blatantly or subtly.
   While the medium and audience make adaptation necessary, intelligent
   cutting can clarify as well as condense, and imaginative artwork can
   convey some of the play's complexity and depth by suggesting more than
   is said. Because the reader must actively cooperate in giving a comic
   book imaginary life, when the artist successfully catalyzes interaction
   between word and picture, careful looking challenges thought. A panel
   or page from a comic book version of Shakespeare can become an
   enjoyable means of helping students grasp that a single text may be
   interpreted several ways, that the text itself is an interpretation,
   and that the culture of the time or place influences shaping and
   understanding of the text. Used imaginatively, comic books can help the
   college student begin to recognize critical problems and theoretical

Abstract = {{Texture discrimination and bounding contour extraction are essential

   Such, successful texture and contour Processing are key components
   underlying the development of the perception of both objects and

   young infants can detect orientation-defined textures and contours. We
   measured responses to an organized texture comprised of many Gabor
   patches of the same orientation, alternated with images containing the
   same number of patches, but all of random orientation. These responses
   were compared with a control condition consisting of the alternation
   between two independently random configurations. Significant difference
   potentials were found as early as 2-5 months, as were significant odd
   harmonics in the test conditions. Responses were also measured to Gabor
   patches organized either as circles (all patches tangent to an
   imaginary circular path) alternated with pinwheels (all patches having
   a fixed orientation offset from the path). Infants between 6 and 13
   months also showed sensitivity to the global organization of the
   elements along contours. Differential responses to our texture and
   contour stimuli and their controls could only have been generated by
   mechanisms that are capable of comparing the relative orientation of 2
   or more patches, as no local information at a single patch
   distinguished the random and organized textures or the circle and
   pinwheel configurations.}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to the dominant depictions of African stagnation amongst
   `Afro-pessimistic' scholars, South African regional ( and retail)
   multinationals are dynamic agents of regional transformation and new

   multinational. The Manda Hill branch of Shoprite in Zambia is the case
   study for this analysis. The context of these workplace studies is
   post-apartheid southern Africa, where investment by South African

   of shopping centre development, where Shoprite's food supermarket is
   the anchor store for these new malls. I argue that a new regional
   moment is shaping the workplace experiences of African workers. The
   Shoprite workplace is an important agent of a new regional imagination
   amongst these retail workers. Workers claim inclusion into the regional
   company on an equal basis with South African workers privileging their
   ties to South Africa through the company. The South African reference
   point in workers' claims is interpreted here as a regional claim. The
   high social visibility of shopping malls and new, South African-owned
   sites of consumption drive a complex regionalism, where different
   social forces claim the new region in competing ways. The new regional

   with a dangerous, `atavistic' influence. Through an investigation of
   Jensen's use of tropes of primitivity, in particular, I argue that such

   changes taking place within Europe itself. Specifically, Madame D'Ora
   deals with the rise of new forms of mass culture and popular
   entertainment such as the cinema - and their effect on traditional

Abstract = {{In the recently published 9111 Commission Report, a major issue in the

   terms of the American intelligence bureaucracy's congenital deficiency
   in imagination ('Imagination is not a gift usually associated with
   bureaucracies'), and in terms of the Al Qaeda terrorists' astonishing
   possession of imagination and sophistication ('We learned about ail
   enemy who is sophisticated, patient, disciplined, and lethal'). The
   9/11 terrorists' imagination, I suggest, was embedded in a
   sophisticated cultural literacy as far as post-modern Americana are
   concerned, including an intimate knowledge of the apocalyptic imaginary
   that typifies much American fin-de-siecle fiction and film, and which,
   consequently, could and would serve as a reservoir of terrorist
   pretexts or scenarios. For the terrorist masterminding 9/11 knew
   exactly what he was doing: the apocalyptic phantasms of the post-modern
   American imaginary would be brought home to roost, as it were, with a
   vengeance. By way of illustration I focus on two texts, a film and

Abstract = {{This paper challenges Lefebvre's distinction between Representations of
   Space and Spaces of Representation. Most current work in this area has
   assumed modernist conceptions of power, thereby interpreting
   representations of space (conceived space) as the property of the
   powerful who alone possess the ability to abstract space for their
   particular ends. Contrary to Lefebvre, I suggest that representation
   and abstraction are not the agents of state capitalism alone but are
   also manifested in `counter' discourses. As an example of a `counter
   discourse' I draw upon a series of editorial articles written in a
   local gay-oriented newspaper about a gay enclave in Vancouver, Canada.
   I argue that these depictions cloud the distinctions as practised
   between conception, abstraction and the imaginary in urban space. They
   also serve to promote one interpretation of space above others, and in
   that sense they colonize the experience of everyday life in their own
   way. The act of `speaking for' presupposes a certain power, and in
   these cases, highlights the fact that the Power of representation and
   abstraction does not only occur at the state or `system' level. I
   suggest that by overcoming the assumption of a zero-sum ontology of
   power, one can see how a variety of agents in the urban context engage
   in the attempt to carve out their `own' spaces of stability in the
   urban social imaginary.}},

Journal = {{ORBIS LITTERARUM}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Abstract = {{Amy Tan and Maxine Hong Kingston engage with the dialectic of
   Chinese-American identity through processes of cultural
   self-empowerment, yet also undermine such work through
   self-orientalizing tendencies within their writing. In Kingston's early
   work and throughout Tan's oeuvre, China is repeatedly figured as an
   imaginary homeland replete with recurrent, often negative, stereotypes.
   Such treatment recalls Edward Said's classic formulations of
   orientalism, particularly when these writers deploy `haunting memories'
   and `remarkable experiences' of the ancestral homeland. Their narrative
   strategies - in which China is so often privileged over America - call
   into question both authors' insistence that they be considered as
   pre-eminently American writers. Moreover, their texts by no means
   represent the inevitable method of negotiating Chinese diasporic
   identities, as demonstrated by the work of Gish Jen and Timothy Mo, for
   example. While a substantial body of secondary literature exploring the
   work of Tan and Kingston exists, a sustained critique of the

Abstract = {{Buddhist cave shrines in medieval China amount to an optical theatre.
   Tracing the history of these mirror halls, the author argues that the
   model of the mirror-hall underlies the conception of Chinese Buddhist
   cave shrines. Focusing on an eighth-century cave at Dunhuang, the
   author demonstrates that the murals covering its ceiling slopes and
   walls combine to map out a temporal-spatial continuum that encompasses
   vast imaginary horizons and cycles of past, present, and future. The
   resulting virtual space facilitates a meditative practice that
   dissolves and obliterates the bedrock of the physical surrounding
   altogether. Pictorial images become oneiric mirror reflections and
   phantasmatic projections of both Buddhist deities and the perceiving
   subject. Individual pictorial tableaux derived from disparate Buddhist
   sutras, rather than illustrating the sutras, mark different phases of
   an implied visualization process and sustain an optical fiction.}},

   Specifically, this paper is concerned with ways that conceptions of

   Britishness and Australianness, based in the primacy of `tradition',
   `the West', and Anglo-Celtic belongings, permeate everyday life in
   London and Sydney and shape their food cultures. The paper traces
   moments in the culinary biographies of two women, one English and one
   Australian of British descent, living in London and Sydney,
   respectively, and close to shopping streets known for the diversity of
   their `ethnic' communities. The women's narratives are instructive in
   their continuities, as much as in their disjunctions. The argument
   follows some of these, including unexpected engagements with `Asia' and
   `Europe' and `cosmopolitan identity'. Resonances from these engagements
   contribute to a more complex and ambivalent sense of belonging than
   first supposed. This is still the region of `mainstream,
   `Anglo'-identity, yet it is one marked by constant spatial redefinition
   and by occasional porosity of boundary.}},

Abstract = {{This study was an attempt to identify the epistemological roots of

   found that, within the context of designing a solution to a stated

   within the processes of conducting physical experiments. We show that
   the process of alternating between these two modes-empirically
   experimenting and experimenting in thought-leads towards a convergence
   on scientifically acceptable concepts. We call this process mutual
   projection. In the process of mutual projection, external
   representations were generated. Objects in the physical environment
   were represented in an imaginary world and these representations were
   associated with processes in the physical world. It is through this
   coupling that constituents of both the imaginary world and the physical
   world gain meaning. We further show that the external representations
   are rooted in sensory interaction and constitute a semi-symbolic
   pictorial communication system, a sort of primitive `language', which
   is developed as the practical work continues. The constituents of this
   pictorial communication system are used in the thought experiments
   taking place in association with the empirical experimentation. The

Abstract = {{Self-reflection, typically operationalized in scales of egocentrism and

   Yet, self-reflection also is seen as essential for adolescent
   development, particularly with respect to individuation and identity.
   In this exploratory study, the authors focused on the process of
   self-reflecting. From interviews with 10 students conducted over the
   first 2 university years, the authors longitudinally assessed and then
   evaluated self-reflecting patterns in relationship to a narrative
   analysis of developmental change. Students who showed evidence of
   developmental change or sustained engagement in developmental work over
   the study period devoted a higher percentage of their interview
   conversation to self-reflecting content. Differences in self-reflecting
   patterning over time among the students who showed developmental change
