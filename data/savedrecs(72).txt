J	ElSamanoudy, Gamal Elsayed Ali						Chova, LG; Martinez, AL; Torres, IC		STUDENTS' IMAGINARY AND HAND-SKETCH AS PRIMARY TOOLS IN DESIGN PROCESS (INTERIOR DESIGN - OFFICES PROJECTS)								7TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE (INTED2013)		INTED Proceedings						6641	6650					2013	2013	Many researches discuss the design field, creativity and invention within specialized international conferences in the arts, architecture, interior design and industrial design. This confirms the important role of design in our daily lives which meets a lot of our need to seek comfortable living ways.As researcher, I believe, that we cannot see any product used by humans without imagining in its design, function, colour, and its materials. Always we are looking for all and attracted by the shape, colour and material of everything we possess. We just request the items to be of high aesthetic value and, of course, after studying its efficiency in performance and durability.The deep point, in this research, is the weaknesses learning process in universities design courses. A clear explanation about the role of design in our practical field as goal that we are trying to achieve in our educational programs to prepare students for working life and labour market needs. As mentioned there are many research addresses the design as a career for professionals and many others dealing with curriculum design and teaching methods. From these researches, I concluded many integrated, compatible and common points, as many confuse no links or missing links in between the design process as profession and educating design to students. Research will focus on the undergraduates students within educational programs that rely on designs courses as its main objective and as the core courses recommended by all the committees of academic accreditation.Research Problem As Associate-Professor in the Department of Interior Design and through my practice in teaching interior design courses, I observed the repetition of the weaknesses in students' ability to imagine and understanding aesthetical forms and the lack of Hand-Sketch skills. Thus the research will emphasis on study to determine the causes of these weaknesses of imagination and the link with Hand-Sketch capabilities as tool to express the student imagination in design solutions to apply the appropriate functional program for success the Interior activity in interior design projects.Research Goal The research aims to takes advantage, analyse and link between researches in the same field to identify problems in teaching design that relate to all aspects of learning in order to find appropriate solutions. A close understanding of the studies will be taken into consideration, through which as a researcher, I can realize what is happening when learning design courses, physiologically and mentally when learning occurs. A confirmation of teaching methods and theories development, as the most important intermediary goal, to achieve learning in order to develop interior design curricula and improve the efficiency and skills of the student.Research Methodology The research shall pursuit the analytical method and a survey for a group of third year Interior Design students. A uniform office space has been given to the students with a free choice for the office activity, to leave the student freedom of creativity and imagination and hand-Sketch work to determine the initial idea for the appropriate design. The survey can extrapolate and analyse the weaknesses during the design stages of preparation, to reach conclusions and recommendations and the appropriate solutions to address students' weaknesses in imagine appropriate design through Hand-Sketch ideas presentations.					7th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)	MAR 04-06, 2013		Valencia, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	2340-1079	978-84-616-2661-8	WOS:000346699806092

J	Florensa, Clara								Breaking the silence: Palaeontology and evolution in La Vanguardia Espanola (1939-1975)								DYNAMIS				33	2			297	320					2013	2013	All traces of evolutionary theories had been removed from the Spanish public sphere during the late stages of the Civil War and early Francoism. Darwin's books were cleared from the shelves of libraries and bookshops and evolutionism was replaced by creationism in primary and higher education manuals. In the public sphere, there was a mixture of concepts concerning evolution that were borrowed from different evolutionary theories, some of them outdated. Talking about evolution in the press meant talking in a nineteenth-century manner about the ape origin of man, materialism and threat to the Catholic faith. In other words, evolution was something unpleasant and dangerous. In this context, certain Spanish palaeontologists went to considerable lengths to try and avoid all of this bad popular imaginary (linking it to Darwinism), and to rehabilitate evolutionism from a finalistic-theistic point of view, which fitted in well with the ideology of the Franco regime. This effort, which succeeded in bringing evolutionism back into the public sphere following a period of "evolutionary silence", was relegated to second place when a new period of regime openness came about. The more scientific jargon of genetics and Modern Synthesis, which was less conducive to origins and theological discussion, fitted in better with the aims of the new regime, thus changing public scientific authority from bones to genes. This paper highlights the ongoing process of the appropriation of evolutionary theory through the case study of the presence and treatment during Francoism of the theory of evolution in the Catalan newspaper La Vanguardia Espanola.									0	0	0	0	0	0211-9536		WOS:000209183400002		
J	Martin, William						Fiorentino, CC; Piscitelli, M		The End of Urban Exploitation and the Rise of the Urban Imaginary: Histories and Futures of Detroit, Michigan								HERITAGE, ARCHITECTURE, LANDESIGN: FOCUS ON CONSERVATION, REGENERATION, INNOVATION		Fabbrica della Conoscenza			39			208	217					2013	2013	Top-down urban development projects often perpetuate sociospatial injustice by focusing renewal in areas occupied by a region's most disenfranchised populations, most commonly urban minorities. Because these populations often lack sufficient political and economic power, they are left with little opportunity to democratically or otherwise oppose the impositions of the dominant urban regime. Legacy forms of urban development through public-private partnership fail to provide an equitable distribution of rights to imagine alternative urban futures even when lead by the most socially radical planners.[1] Such development is conversely complicit in ensuring and facilitating capitalist exploitation of city land. In this paper I will trace the multiple forms of this exploitation before exploring projective strategies for establishing a new urban imaginary as a productive alternatives to the existing paradigm. There exists an extensive body of analytical and critical literature concerning spatial issues of urban injustice and inequality through the lens of Marxist critique, geography, urban planning, architecture, and public policy. This literature focuses on cities as spaces of conflict. This work suggests the potential of interactive media practices to instrumentalized as a means of innovating operative spatial strategies that could enfranchise populations with capacities for self-directed planning that exist outside of both the reactionary activist paradigms of resistance and revolution, whose tools are outmoded. This argument is intended to present one of many potential modes that the paper hopes to inspire. In the first half of the paper, taking Detroit, MI as a paradigm case in a global context, I will trace historic hegemonic regimes of urban development through three phases that dominated Detroit's urban imaginary: (1) federal funded creative destruction (1949-1969), (2) globalization and entrepreneurial governance (1970-1989), (3) postmodern monopoly rents (1990-present). This history will reveal how the imposition of top-down urban imaginaries resulted in the exploitative and spatially unjust environment of Post-World War II Detroit. In the second half of the paper I will begin to theorize the potential of new forms for mediated spatial practices to empower disenfranchised urban populations with the capacity to lay claim to a more equitable future through the production of a radically new urban imaginary.					11th International Forum of Studies - The Paths of the Merchants	JUN 13-15, 2013	Seconda Univ Studi Napoli; Dipartimento Architettura & Disegno Industriale; Benecon Knowledge Network; Topcon; Unione Italiana Disegno; Forum UNESCO; United Nat Educ, Sci & Cultural Org, Commissione Nazionale Italiana; US Italy Fulbright Commiss Linking Minds Across Cultures	Aversa, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0		978-88-6542-290-8	WOS:000346374300021		
J	Waterman, Tim						Fiorentino, CC; Piscitelli, M		Making Belief: Tastemaking, the Public Imagination, and the Spaces of Everyday Life								HERITAGE, ARCHITECTURE, LANDESIGN: FOCUS ON CONSERVATION, REGENERATION, INNOVATION		Fabbrica della Conoscenza			39			1150	1157					2013	2013	Popular taste-makers have long exerted a profound influence on the practice of everyday life and on the built environment, and many landscapes we now see as particularly vernacular or local are actually the result of recent or contemporary media influence. Tastemaking events, home shows, for example, have had a powerful impact which lingered on in the public memory much longer than the products featured in them might have survived in people's homes. The influence of such personalities and events is usually concerned primarily in a strictly domestic sphere, proscribed by the limits of the kitchen, home, and garden.Cumulatively and collectively considered, however, the manipulation of popular tastes that may have been intended to sell products or improve domestic life has just as effectively determined the built form of neighbourhoods and cities. Further, urban form is shaped by the actions, tactics, and associations of everyday life as modified by shifts in taste and public belief. Collectively held ideals - in part beliefs constructed by tastemaking - facilitated by technological innovations can, in a contemporary environment, redefine how designers and communities work together to create built form. This paper will evaluate the place of make-believe and future landscape imaginaries in the creation and adaptation of suburbia.					11th International Forum of Studies - The Paths of the Merchants	JUN 13-15, 2013	Seconda Univ Studi Napoli; Dipartimento Architettura & Disegno Industriale; Benecon Knowledge Network; Topcon; Unione Italiana Disegno; Forum UNESCO; United Nat Educ, Sci & Cultural Org, Commissione Nazionale Italiana; US Italy Fulbright Commiss Linking Minds Across Cultures	Aversa, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0		978-88-6542-290-8	WOS:000346374300129		
J	de Oliveira, Ilca Vieira								"Between the clock na the map": Cecilia Meireles' trip in Spain								REVISTA DE LETRAS				53	1			139	157					JAN-JUN 2013	2013	The verses "Por fluidos paises passeio/com o passo da lua nas nuvens/ flutuante e longe" taken from the book Sonhos (Dreams) (1950-1963), by Cecilia Meireles (2001c), lead us to reflect on the theme 'trips' in the poems "Tres cancoes da Espanha" (Three songs of Spain) and "Pastoral VII", from Poemas de viagens (poems of trips) (MEIRELES, 2001a) and the chronic "Entre o relogio e o mapa" (Between the clock and the map) (MEIRELES, 1999b) and "Castilla la biennombrada" " (MEIRELES, 1999a) and "Quando o turista transforma em viajante" (When the tourist becomes a traveler) " (MEIRELES, 1999c) from Cronicas de viagens, 2 (Chronicles of trips, 2), watching the way the traveler's image is constructed from a conception of time and space. In this study there will also be a reading of the cities' images and places that the traveler poet recreatesfrom the moment she strolls in Spain in her real and imaginary trips. This study will be conducted based on thetheoretical propositions presented in the text Teoria da viagem (Theory of trip): geographic poem, by Michel Onfray (2009).									0	0	0	0	0	0101-3505		WOS:000346816900009		
J	Oeyen, Annelies								Urban Journeys Constructing Literary Space: An Analysis of "Cuando aparecen Aquellos" by Marcelo Cohen								RILCE-REVISTA DE FILOLOGIA HISPANICA				29	1			99	114					JAN-JUN 2013	2013	"Cuando aparecen Aquellos" is the narration of two friends walking across an imaginary and futuristic city. In this article we will examine how this journey sets the basis for the literary construction of urban space. First, we will analyze to what extent the text that results from this journey contains a dystopic representation of the physical, public and exterior city, a city we can compare to what Josefina Ludmer has called a "present territory". On a second level, we will see how, during his journey, the main character also constructs an interior, personal and mental city that he projects onto the dystopic city and in which resonates his lost personal past. Michel De Certeau's theories of "Marches dans la ville" will help us to identify the construction of the interior city as a technique of individual reappropriation of space, as a personal practice of resistance that allows the main characters to escape dystopic space.									0	0	0	0	0	0213-2370		WOS:000311767700006		
J	Benedetto, E.; Capriolo, M.; Feoli, A.; Tucci, D.								Some remarks about underused Loedel diagrams								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS				34	1			67	74		10.1088/0143-0807/34/1/67			JAN 2013	2013	We emphasize that it can be didactically very useful for students to realize how a space-time diagram of an observer, moving with a constant velocity with respect to another observer, can be obtained easily by means of a standard matrix of rotation, without recourse to imaginary axes and angles. These diagrams were introduced for the first time by Loedel and their main advantage over Minkowski diagrams is that a scale factor is not necessary to convert the units of an observer to those of another observer. We show this well-known property of Loedel diagrams using a new geometric approach.									0	0	0	0	0	0143-0807		WOS:000312252500016

The documentaries show the decline of legitimacy of the opposing political forces, the radicalization of the political actors involved, and the configuration and affirmation of antagonistic social subjects. Toward the end of the 1960s, this process led to an imaginary of revolution and violence that energized documentary practices and forms.									0	0	0	0	0	0094-582X		WOS:000312009100002

The present study adds a new agent to the listthe imaginary/invisible friend. Three types of ToM tasks were administered to 36 children, ages 2 to 8, who had invisible friends at the time of the tasks: occluded picture, background knowledge, and surprising contents tasks. The knowledge attributed to imaginary companions was compared to the knowledge attributed to God, as well as to a human and to a dog. Results showed that younger children tended to attribute knowledge to all agents, including imaginary friends. Older children treated God differently from all other agents, but the invisible friend was also treated differently from the human and the dog. Implications regarding cognitive development and anthropomorphism are considered, as well as for the in-between character of invisible friends.									1	0	1	0	1	1050-8619		WOS:000312538700002		
J	Friedner, Michele; Osborne, Jamie								Audit Bodies: Embodied Participation, Disability Universalism, and Accessibility in India								ANTIPODE				45	1			43	60		10.1111/j.1467-8330.2012.00990.x			JAN 2013	2013	In this article we think critically about the role of the access audit in creating new forms of embodied participation, experiential and technical expertise, and imaginaries of what the modern Indian city should be. We analyze how disability activists make claims about the relationship between subjective bodily experiences and bodies of objective knowledge. We also explore the emergence of a professional access audit apparatus focused on technical standards. As neither volunteer nor professional access audits result in significant architectural or structural changes, we are interested in what other effects and affects these audits produce and what discursive authority claims of inaccessibility have. This article analyzes the practice of conducting access audits by lay and professional disability rights activists and organizations in urban India. We argue that access audits are overly focused and that they have limited impact. In overly focusing on physical and technical access, auditors miss the importance of programmatic and policy interventions as well as the need for a more collective contentious politics. Our research illustrates that the contested field of access auditing appears to prevent a unified disability coalition from forming. In addition, it is important for auditors to think critically about the concept of access and ask what social, economic, and political processes are embedded within the concept.									2	0	1	0	2	0066-4812		WOS:000312532300003

It considers how the contemporary relational region negotiates the historical context of sedimented practices and imaginaries of territory and authority. Through an analysis of micro-social relations, the paper examines how regionally based governance structures are negotiated through trans-local, inter-regional and international practices. It calls for attention to be placed on the planned and prosaic, conscious and unconscious practices, discourses and connections that are involved in the becoming of a region.									1	0	0	0	1	0034-3404		WOS:000312592500007

Adaptive reorganization of cortical networks in Alzheimer's disease								CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY				124	1			35	43		10.1016/j.clinph.2012.05.028			JAN 2013	2013	Objective: The impact of neuronal cell loss associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) on the network organization of the brain is poorly understood. Here we investigated whether modifications in resting-state functional connectivity (FC) are associated with cognitive function of AD patients.Methods: High-density electroencephalograms (EEGs) were obtained from patients with early stages of AD and elderly healthy controls. Cortical oscillations were reconstructed with an adaptive spatial filter. Maps of imaginary coherence (IC) between brain areas were compared between groups and correlated with cognitive performance.Results: Parietal and medial temporal lobes of AD patients showed a disruption of alpha band FC to the rest of the brain. However, an adaptive extension of the language network to the right hemisphere could be observed in AD patients and was correlated with better verbal fluency. A shift of FC from alpha frequencies to theta frequencies could be observed in a memory network and was associated with better verbal memory performance.Conclusions: Not only dysfunctional but also adaptive network reorganization occurs in early AD.Significance: The network mechanisms for preserved cognitive functioning may inform novel treatment strategies for AD in the future.

J	Casas-Cortes, Maribel; Cobarrubias, Sebastian; Pickles, John								Re-bordering the neighbourhood: Europe's emerging geographies of non-accession integration								EUROPEAN URBAN AND REGIONAL STUDIES				20	1			37	58		10.1177/0969776411434848			JAN 2013	2013	This paper highlights the ways in which the emerging models of migration management are producing new geographies of the European Union's borders that complicate notions of a tightly bounded and easily delineated 'Schengen space' or 'Fortress Europe'. Under policy frameworks such as the European Neighbourhood Policy and the EU's Global Approach to Migration, a process of economic and political regional integration is under way that is beginning to transform the ways in which non-accession neighbours and neighbours of neighbours in North Africa and beyond are articulated with the EU. Central to these changes are programmes, institutions and practices of both regional economic development and border routes management. This changing geopolitical and geo-economic approach to regional integration and the nature of European borderlands has at its heart a series of new spatial imaginaries, institutional actors and cartographic experiments that point to a project in process in which the relationships between territory, state and population are being reconfigured to produce new notions of sovereignty across more complex and multiple borders and, in some cases, beyond borders.									3	0	0	0	3	0969-7764		WOS:000313208900003

J	Kelly, Philip F.				Kelly, Philip/H-3823-2013				Production networks, place and development: Thinking through Global Production Networks in Cavite, Philippines								GEOFORUM				44				82	92		10.1016/j.geoforum.2011.10.003			2013	2013	Global Production Networks (GPNs) offer the possibility of a nuanced and encompassing account of how value is created and distributed in productive systems that span the globe. This paper argues, however, that there are ultimately limits to the vision of even the most finely tuned 'network' approach, and these become especially apparent when the concept of development is introduced. Taking development to be a fundamentally areal idea, concerned with improvement of the human condition in specific places, questions arise about how effectively a focus on production networks can capture such processes of change. Using the case of Cavite in the Philippines, the paper explores the dimensions of rapid development in a place that are made visible using a GPN framework, and those that may remain hidden. Hidden processes may include landscape and environmental change, households and livelihoods, and social differentiation and uneven geographical development. The paper concludes that GPN approaches tend to subordinate the completeness of places by focusing on their role in firms' production networks. It suggests that instead of resolving the dialectic between place and network in favour of networks, a productive tension between two spatial imaginaries should be maintained. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Urbanik, Julie; Morgan, Mary								A tale of tails: The place of dog parks in the urban imaginary								GEOFORUM				44				292	302		10.1016/j.geoforum.2012.08.001			2013	2013	According to the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association there are similar to 75 million dogs living as companion animals in the country and similar to 39% of all households include a dog. Because a significant population of dogs live in urban areas, there has been a growing interest in improving where and how dogs can inhabit city spaces. One result of this interest has been the rise of dog parks or off-leash dog areas - often inside of, or attached to, public parks. These dog parks, however, are not without controversy. At the heart of the controversy are two interrelated questions: (1) where and how do the needs of other species become incorporated into urban spaces? and (2) what is the place of dogs in the conceptual identity of urban residents? To answer these questions we used Kansas City, Missouri, as a case study because it is an urban area of similar to 100,000 dogs (similar to 400,000 humans), one established dog park, and a recent political battle over establishing a second. We combine theoretical grounding in animal and urban geographies with data from a news media analysis, a small-scale resident survey, a content analysis of public comments, and interviews to demonstrate that as the urban human-dog relationship changes in the private space of the home it is driving new urban identities and new configurations of public spaces.

J	Purves, Gordon Michael								Finding truth in fictions: identifying non-fictions in imaginary cracks								SYNTHESE				190	2			235	251		10.1007/s11229-012-0144-5			JAN 2013	2013	I critically examine some recent work on the philosophy of scientific fictions, focusing on the work of Winsberg. By considering two case studies in fracture mechanics, the strip yield model and the imaginary crack method, I argue that his reliance upon the social norms associated with an element of a model forces him to remain silent whenever those norms fail to clearly match the characteristic of fictions or non-fictions. In its place, I propose a normative epistemology of fictions which clarifies a model's ontological commitments when the community of scientists lack any clear, shared norms of use. Specifically, I will introduce a variational account of fictions as an extension of Laymon's monotonic improvability account of idealizations. I will conclude by connecting this variational account of fictions to didactic fictions in general.									0	0	0	0	0	0039-7857		WOS:000313065500005		
J	Hult, Anna								Swedish Production of Sustainable Urban Imaginaries in China								JOURNAL OF URBAN TECHNOLOGY				20	1	SI		77	94		10.1080/10630732.2012.735405			JAN 1 2013	2013	Sweden and the broader region of Scandinavia have been widely praised for their efforts to develop and promote models of sustainability for the rest of the world. Swedish international architecture and urban planning firms are driven by the advantage of being able to brand their projects as Sustainable and Scandinavian. In this sense, the sustainable city has become a Swedish service to export. In order to strengthen a coherent image of Swedish sustainable urban development, in, 2007, the Swedish Trade Council initiated a marketing platform for eco-profiled companies under the name of SymbioCity. This paper seeks to explore the production of imaginaries at play in the performance of SymbioCity. It especially addresses the way in which notions of progress and a better city life were presented to Chinese audiences in the Swedish pavilion at the World Expo in Shanghai in 2010. The Swedish pavilion is here regarded as a node in the export of a wider network of Swedish sustainable urban planning services. I argue that the imaginaries that Sweden produces through activities associated with the SymbioCity underlines a view that equates progress with the notion of decoupling of economic growth and CO2-emissions. In presenting an image of decoupling as a Swedish experience possible to transfer to China, it also establishes views of progress as linear and space as static. Using the term absent presence opens up a counter narrative, which turns decoupling as a Swedish experience into a myth and raises the need for urban imaginaries based on a relational view of space.									3	0	0	0	3	1063-0732		WOS:000314349900006

J	Mahlck, Paula								Academic women with migrant background in the global knowledge economy: Bodies, hierarchies and resistance								WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM				36		SI		65	74		10.1016/j.wsif.2012.09.007			JAN-FEB 2013	2013	Across the globe, academic work is changing in order to meet the demands of the global knowledge economy. This process of change is characterised by the dominant discourses of competition, accountability and excellence, which produce an imaginary of a seemingly disembodied researcher. Departing from a Swedish higher education and research policy landscape, the aim of this article is to explore how, in comparison with their Swedish colleagues, women academics with a migrant background make representations of the good researcher in their work practices. This involves exploring how processes of racialisation - including processes of whiteness are at work when different layers of migration are read through a white Swedish normality. The results indicate that whiteness is an attributed quality and contributes to constructing success, and that racialised researchers stand out as being particularly invisible representations within a Research Excellence framework. In this article I suggest that this visibility/invisibility paradox (Mirza 2009) can be interpreted not only as a reflection of the number of racialised researchers in Swedish higher education, but also as a general discourse of colour-blindness and Swedish white privilege.

EEG alpha band synchrony predicts cognitive and motor performance in patients with ischemic stroke								BEHAVIOURAL NEUROLOGY				26	3			187	189		10.3233/BEN-2012-129007			2013	2013	Functional brain networks are known to be affected by focal brain lesions. However, the clinical relevance of these changes remains unclear. This study assesses resting-state functional connectivity (FC) with electroencephalography (EEG) and relates observed topography of FC to cognitive and motor deficits in patients three months after ischemic stroke. Twenty patients (mean age 61.3 years, range 37-80, 9 females) and nineteen age-matched healthy participants (mean age 66.7 years, range 36-88, 13 females) underwent a ten-minute EEG-resting state examination. The neural oscillations at each grey matter voxel were reconstructed using an adaptive spatial filter and imaginary component of coherence (IC) was calculated as an index of FC. Maps representing mean connectivity value at each voxel were correlated with the clinical data. Compared to healthy controls, alpha band IC of stroke patients was locally reduced in brain regions critical to observed behavioral deficits. A voxel-wise Pearson correlation of clinical performances with FC yielded maps of the neural structures implicated in motor, language; and executive function. This correlation was again specific to alpha band coherence. Ischemic lesions decrease the synchrony of alpha band oscillations between affected brain regions and the rest of the brain. This decrease is linearly related to cognitive and motor deficits observed in the patients.									1	0	0	0	1	0953-4180		WOS:000315323800007	22713421	
J	Hiramoto, Mie								Hey, you're a girl?: Gendered expressions in the popular anime, Cowboy Bebop								MULTILINGUA-JOURNAL OF CROSS-CULTURAL AND INTERLANGUAGE COMMUNICATION				32	1			51	78					2013	2013	The popular anime series, Cowboy Bebop, was originally created and released in Japan in 1998 and later gained an intense overseas following. The show owes its phenomenal international acclaim to successful conventions of hegemonic masculinity represented by the imaginary characters. The social semiotics of desire depicted in Cowboy Bebop cater to a general heterosexual market in which hero and babe characters are represented by archetypes of heterosexual normativity. In this study, the idea of inter-indexicality, or 'the movement between two distinctive indexical systems as a semiotic mode of subject formation' (Inoue 2003: 317), will be employed in the discussion of data derived from the Japanese and American English dubbing of Cowboy Bebop. The analysis will focus on how ideas including heterosexual normativity are reproduced in order to negotiate the intertextual distances that link the characters and audience. Inter-indexical notions help to construct interpretive voices familiar to the cross-cultural audience's social world.									0	0	0	0	0	0167-8507		WOS:000315365900003

The article is structured in two parts. The first part examines how materiality has been repositioned as a site of and for politics. I chart three different strands of material politics prevalent in contemporary urban theory: material politics as (1) the inscription of metabolic infrastructures, (2) the disruption of the sensible and (3) the assembling of socio-material entanglements. I then argue for the need to devise a definition of material politics that incorporates the notion of actualization and reflects the involvement of materials in the invention of and experimentation with alternative urban imaginaries. In the second part, I describe the assembly of Le Corbusier's proposed concrete biology for Buenos Aires by examining three interrelated mechanisms: valorization, circulation and abstraction. To conclude, I emphasize the methodological value of using the instance of materialization as a form of tracing the historical emergence and transformation of alternative forms of problematizing and imagining the production of urban space.									0	0	0	0	0	0309-1317		WOS:000315467900013		
J	Millington, Nate								Post-Industrial Imaginaries: Nature, Representation and Ruin in Detroit, Michigan								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH				37	1			279	296		10.1111/j.1468-2427.2012.01206.x			JAN 2013	2013	With plans underway for large-scale urban agriculture and a proliferation of representations made of the city's vacant lots, Detroit, Michigan is increasingly understood as a particularly hybrid metropolis that complicates conceptual divisions between city and nature. This article looks at representations of urban nature found in Detroit, focusing primarily on the work by photographers and journalists over the past 5 years as part of a broader discourse on Detroit's decline. By drawing from urban political ecology and critical work on nature, this article argues that representations of the city suggest an ambivalence, both popular and scholarly, about the emergent ecologies found in cities like Detroit. But, ultimately, journalists and commentators see nature in the city as a reflection of the city's absence, rather than its materiality, and so representations of Detroit reflect dominant conceptual divisions between the city and the non-human world. This article builds on work in urban political ecology and environmental history to argue that representations and discourses about nature are important in the production of just urban environments.									6	0	0	0	6	0309-1317		WOS:000315467900015

Participants were 27 male undergraduates (13 repressors, 14 nonrepressors) who watched video clips of a motorbike accident as we recorded their galvanic skin response (GSR). We then conducted the TNT paradigm using motorbike accident images. Both repressors and nonrepressors recorded higher GSR when watching the video clips than at baseline. Both groups showed greater suppression of imaginary memories in the no-think condition than they did in either the think or the baseline conditions. We found repeated attempts at no-think might be an effective strategy for suppressing imaginary memories and that there were no differences in the ability of repressors and nonrepressors to suppress memory in the imaginary memory condition.									2	0	0	0	2	0301-2212		WOS:000316054800016

Issues relative to the character of space and time have indeed been central to philosophy from its inception. In literary investigations these concepts have been always vibrating at the edges of imagination. The writer uses an instrument to achieve an always closer approach to concrete reality. The importance of setting focuses on space as a cultural code of literature. In this way the identity of many individuals and communities are structured based on different spaces in a complex range of imaginary patterns of representation. This matter helps the reader focus deeply on the issue and reconceptualize the space in his/her mind. When speaking about spaces of intertextuality we have in mind the play and interference of heterogeneous semiotic spaces transposed in the text from elsewhere, either from other spatial representations (textual or visual worlds) or by evoking culturally characteristic locations. This article focusing on all vicissitudes of space and place in literature tries to review the voluptuousness of high places in fiction. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Cummings, Maggie								Looking Good: The Cultural Politics of the Island Dress for Young Women in Vanuatu								CONTEMPORARY PACIFIC				25	1			33	65					2013	2013	In this article, I explore the contingent and contested boundaries of looking good for young women in Vanuatu and the ways in which they negotiate these boundaries. I use women's dress as a lens through which to focus on the relationships among gender, modernity, race, and morality, and I show the ways in which all four are condensed and embodied in the moral and aesthetic imperative for women to look good. In particular, I focus on the island dress, a dress first introduced by missionaries but taken up after independence as an emblem of national pride and as the traditional dress for women. Although wearing the island dress is the commonsense way for women to look good, the young women with whom I conducted fieldwork in 2001-2002 and again in 2008 and 2011 experienced a great deal of ambivalence about the dress. They often preferred to wear trousers and T-shirts, which frequently won them the disapproval of their elders. By focusing on the polyvalent meanings of the island dress, the realities of young people's everyday lives in the capital, and the uneven terrain of the dress-scape of Vanuatu, I show that young women's love/hate relationship with island dress reflects their frustration with their ambiguous place in the contemporary national imaginary.									1	0	0	0	1	1043-898X		WOS:000317323700003

It shows that national and imperial anthropology were not two separate spheres and that the movement of anthropologists and their objects was important both for the making of anthropology as a scientific discipline and for making anthropological ideas. Trying to define the physical features of people in Dutch fishing villages and in East Indies inland regions, anthropologists formed geographies of imaginary difference. Anthropological data from the Indies however was valued more highly than that from the Netherlands, which means that distance continued to matter. New Imperial Historians would therefore do better to sharpen their perception of these uneven geographies.									0	0	0	0	0	0165-0505		WOS:000317532000006

His appropriation of the conventions of the Western lays bare the underpinning ideologies of the genre, especially imperialist assumptions about wilderness and the role that genre and wilderness play in American and Canadian national mythologies. His configuration of the North American West rejects the traditional idea of space as a static background for historical events. This article investigates how Vanderhaeghe rewrites the past of the North American West in spatial terms to expose the interconnection among colonialism, the Western and the national imaginary, and how such remapping presents the Western landscape as a space palimpsestically inscribed by diverse social discourses.									0	0	0	0	0	0269-9222		WOS:000318198700002

J	Cotter, Richard								Peters' Concept of 'Education as Initiation': Communitarian or individualist?								EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY				45	2	SI		171	181		10.1080/00131857.2012.752983			2013	2013	A central element of Richard Peters' philosophy of education has been his analysis of 'education as initiation'. Understanding initiation is internally related to concepts of community and what it may mean to be a member. The concept of initiation assumes a mutually interdependent, dynamic relationship between the individual and community that claims to be justified on cognitive, moral and practical grounds. Although Peters' analysis is embedded in a different discourse, his insights are relevant to current discourse on the individual in community. A fruitful conversation can be developed between Peters' account of the learner's 'initiation' into 'bodies of knowledge and awareness' and Alasdair MacIntyre's concept of 'practices'; and how both assume a notion of 'tradition' within partly overlapping accounts of 'community'. Secondly, I will consider how 'initiation' touches the concept of 'social justice as membership' developed by current philosophers, Michael Sandel and Michael Walzer, and what import Peters' analysis has for different degrees of active and passive membership and participation. Thirdly, I will consider Charles Taylor's 'social imaginary' as a contextual framework for processes surrounding 'education as initiation'. This article does not argue that Peters' concept of initiation cannot be contested at some points but rather that it can inform, and be informed by, the conversation with those who contend that community is itself a good essential for human flourishing.									0	0	0	0	0	0013-1857		WOS:000318183900006		
J	Rosenfeld, Zoe; Duret, Isabelle								A study on the relationship in adoptive families during adolescence								THERAPIE FAMILIALE				34	1			165	178					2013	2013	A study on the relationship in adoptive families during adolescence. - The combined use of two systemic tools - the free genogram and the imaginary genogram - and the attachment interviews allows a particularly rich and dense reading, regarding family representations and attachment in adoptive families during adolescence. The links, the memberships, what can bind or unbind, and lock a family in its evolutionary possibilities, express themselves throughout the design and speech. Inter- and trans-generational transmissions will as so be put forward, but also the material, all that filiative and individual material that lies among each parent before adoption and which could have and might still influence the attachment and the feeling of family bound. We propose to explore these tools through a situation based on a research on adoptive families during adolescence.									0	0	0	0	0	0250-4952		WOS:000319717400010

From the perspective of transnational and transoceanic exchanges, in the context of present-day globalization with its massive migrations, numerous exiles and other forms of passage, we would like to make a contribution to the reflections on the critical posture of the relational by taking into account these various modes of crossing, translation and multiple relations, both in the social and in the artistic fields.									0	0	0	0	0	1517-106X		WOS:000319985500008

In the past two decades or so, this ruralist paradigm has been effectively superseded by a metropolitan imaginary in which the modern, globalised megacity increasingly functions as representative of India as a whole. Has the village, then, entirely vanished from the cultural imaginary in contemporary India? Addressing economic practices from upper-class consumerism to working-class family support strategies, this paper attempts to trace how 'the village' resurfaces or survives as a cultural reference point in the midst of the urban.									0	0	0	0	0	0044-2305		WOS:000320288100007

J	Aron, I.						Duvac, C; Tomita, M		The human behaivior simulation in front of the judicial psychologist								CRIMINAL REPRESSION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND THE MAXIMIZATION OF CRIME AT EUROPEAN AND GLOBAL LEVEL								307	311					2013	2013	The non seemingly behaviour is precursory, a behaviour oriented towards attitude.Between the seeming and the non seeming behaviour there is the following relation:the simultaneous existance of the two ways of behaving.The non seeming way thourgh its anticipative preparing and orientation can come after the seeming way.The non seeming behaviour can succeed a done and finalized activity without having been doubled by a notable exterior expression.In the blueprint of simulated behaviour we distinguish two important elements:the moment when the stimul is given or is refreshed something significant for the subject.the evaluation, the selection of different types of answer; here we have to watch the seeming way that the simulating subject expresses his intentions.That what is fake is the meaning the individual gives to the component he offers towards direct observation, meaning that must be assingned after his intention to the seeming behaviour.On the basis of the initial contacts, the investigator appreciates the expressed behaviour, especially the subject's facial gestures, as an obvious reality, as a sum of dynamic features and characteristics, that bring out emotional states, states that need to be correctly interpreted.Specialised literature emphasizes that the most common of these manifestations are: blushing, dilatation of blood vessels (noticable in the temple area), spasms, voice tembling, shivering hands and feet or sudden blockage of a person's movements, reduced saliva, an expanded time of response, not looking in the investigator's eyes. It is obvious that an experimented investigator cannot miss this kind of behaviour. For such a person, voice tembling, hands trembling, picking imaginary lints, mollycoddling their purse, pauses in conversation, answering a question with another question will be more than sufficient for him to tell upon someone's behaviour and disconfort when being questioned by authorities. Experience brings out not the difficulty in seeing these aspects, but the defficiency in correclty interpret them.In light of these physical manifestations and the way they are being put out, control techniques have been created to observe honesty in statements.Ever since Ancient times, the judges from that time use a veru famous method of testing the accused: the rice method. It was about the accused having to swallow quickly an amount of rice, after each false statement, basing itself on the principle that through God's will, any person who has given a false statement would find it impossible to swallow that rice.Altough this method sounds naive, it has a scientific argument: in strong emotional states, the amount of saliva shrinks, and so you cannot swallow a hand of dry rice.Being accused of doing something bad and the emotional state created with this feeling and also bringing Divinity into the question is not very conclusive; on the other hand it is real; the method allows observing the emotional state, but is not conclusive in establishing the subject's honesty, given the differences between individuals (some may be emotional without being guilty)Practice has brought out the fact that despite rare exceptions (persons that have had repeated contacts with justice), an open attitude, an open look, a fluent telling of the facts, the good will on answering the questions, the witness's regret that he can't answer some questions, with the reason that if he had known that those kind of circumstances are of interest to justice, he had tried to remember them, togheter with a gesture and mymics that are matching the facts that are being told, usually stands for a sincere behaviour, non simulated. On the contrary (exceptions are the persons that don't usually have contact with the authorities and frustrated individuals) trying to be overcarefull, reserved, hesitation, contradictions, confusion, blushing, acceleration of sweat, studied gestures, low tone of voice, asking for a glass of water, they all indicate a simulated, dishonest behaviour.We must keep in sight that all of these observations that come out from observing the expressive attitude and behaviour of the witness, mean just an orientacion upon some psycological clues. They need to be carefully evaluated no matter how strong of an impression they make, because appearances don't always match reality and a novice investigator can fail.Here is why we must keep in mind that the individual is born with the capacity of disimulating, lying, disordering his true feelings, his true emotional states and that the witness can control his emotional states, states that are not accurate to his real psychic ones.

J	Gordic Petkovic, Vladislava								URBAN REALITIES OF FEMALE CHARACTERS: NARRATIVE PROSPECTS OF THE FICTIONAL AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL NOVEL								KNJIZEVNA SMOTRA				45	1			27	36					2013	2013	The essay examines urban life as depicted in contemporary Serbian and British novels, focusing on the genre of fictional autobiography, which records imaginary lives of outstanding female personalities. Tipping the Velvet by Sarah Waters, along with the novels by Mirjana Durdevic, Jelena Lengold, Mileta Prodanovic and Svetislav Basara, picture lives of women in an urban setting, endowing them with a comic, tragic or farcical perspective. While, according to Michel Foucault, we relate our identity formation to the clothes we wear, the food we eat or the language we speak, this essay will focus on those aspects of women's urban identities which are placed within the frame of the fictional autobiography. Sarah Waters's first novel, Tipping the Velvet, is the story about Nancy Astley, who manages to discover and affirm her social and sexual identity in the late Victorian culture, whereas the novels and stories by Basara, Durdevic, Lengold and Prodanovie find mythical or farcical elements in modern Serbian history which enable them to produce a range of empowered female characters.									0	0	0	0	0	0455-0463		WOS:000320739700003		
J	Olausson, Ulrika								Theorizing Global Media as Global Discourse								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION				7				1281	1297					2013	2013	Within the field of global media studies, there is an ongoing conflict between the globalists, who emphasize the media's pertinent role in globalization processes, and the skeptics, who stress the continuing stability of the nation-state paradigm as regards the media. Nonetheless, these two positions share one fundamental view on global media: that the proper objects of study are those media whose global nature is defined in terms of geographic reach. In the discourse perspective theorized in this article, however, "globality" is instead viewed as a discursive feature. It is argued that the established understanding of global media as media of transnational reach needs to be complemented with a discourse approach-focusing on the very knowledge production of "the global."									3	0	0	0	3	1932-8036		WOS:000321956600001

This paper aims to give backbone to this debate, to go through the concepts of the symbol by means of different approaches (sociology, cultural studies, anthropology, philosophy and linguistics), to take the initial argument from the material positions to formal ones and to draw up a conclusion which opens up a door to recovering symbol in the present day.									0	0	0	0	0	0210-1963		WOS:000321948100006		
J	Downs, Alexis; Stetson, T. Beth								The American Dream and the limits of transparency								JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT				26	4			689	702		10.1108/JOCM-May-2012-0064			2013	2013	Purpose - The question of whether the words "American Dream" point to something of substance is at the heart of the authors' inquiry. James Truslow Adams coined the term in his 1933 book The Epic of America as a way to re-establish a sense of optimism decimated by the Great Depression. Adams' contribution was to move the public discourse from that of individual effort to a sense of a collective identity. The American Dream is an element of the "cultural stuff" whose singularity ("dream") rapidly breaks down into a variety of interpretations about the American nation ("dreams"). The popular press suggests that the Dream proposes to balance collective membership in a national identity with the individual freedom to achieve prosperity and success. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the Dream and the construction of an American identity by examining the accounts of men who surely represent the American Dream: US Presidential candidates.Design/methodology/approach - In order to analyze the candidates' accounts of themselves as committed to their American identity and to the American Dream, the authors view the tax returns and speeches of Presidential candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney through the lens of the psychoanalytic theories of Jacques Lacan and locate the American Dream as a construct of the imaginary and symbolic orders, as they are defined by Jacques Lacan. The inspirations for the authors' analysis are twofold. One is a 1953 report in which Lacan said, "The unconscious of the subject is the discourse of the other". The authors argue that the American Dream is the "discourse of the other" and suggest that the American identity is decentered: i.e. a signifying construct (the American Dream) substitutes for identity. The second inspiration is a 2009 paper titled "No one is perfect" by John Roberts, who argues, "The ideal of a transparency pretends to a mere making visible [ ... ] [But] transparency works to advertise an ideal against which we will always fail".Findings - It was found that the candidates' efforts to be transparent advertise an ideal: in this study, the ideal is the ideal of a "perfect-able" American who lives the American Dream. It is an ideal against which the candidates fail because it is the "discourse of the other".Research limitations/implications - This study has limitations. The subjects are two American citizens and the authors' interpretation might not be appropriate to other American citizens and residents.Originality/value - The authors are aware of no other study that uses Lacanian psychoanalytic views to examine the American Dream.									0	0	0	0	0	0953-4814		WOS:000321881800005

I first trace how a war on poverty featured in the U.S. popular imaginary as it was shaped by the media and formulated in public policy. I then turn to how this popular imaginary was crystallized and contested in fictive representations of motherhood and welfare. Claudine (1974) is an early example of the regulatory practices of the welfare state and marks the discursive emergence of the War on Welfare while Sapphire's novel Push (1996) marks the year that massive welfare reform legislation was enacted by the Clinton administration, a signature of neoliberals triumph. Lee Daniel's subsequent film, Precious, an adaptation of Push is a reminder that in a so-called post-racial American the welfare queen stereotype is still very present.									0	0	0	0	0	1099-9949		WOS:000322150800004		
J	Valatka, Vytis								Antique Cynicism: A World of Mythos as the Place where Modesty, Morality and Being Unfolds								LOGOS-VILNIUS					75			50	59					2013	2013	The Antique cynical philosophy earned it's fame by the first total anti-civilizational insurrection within the frames of history of Western culture. According to cynics, the concept of morals established by civilization destroys temperance as the fundamental principle of human being and nature, thus precluding every possibility of human happiness. Therefore human race needs to return to primordial temperance. The perfect examples of the latter were traced by cynics in the reality constructed by myths, namely, in lives of ancient Greek heroes and mythological barbarian sages and warriors as well as in equivalent of Thomas More's Utopia remote imaginary island "Pera". The cases of sanctions following violation of natural temperance are also taken from mythical world. The best pattern for that is an interpretation of Prometheus' fate. According to cynics, this titan, so honored and worshiped in Ancient Greece, nevertheless was rightly hammered to a rock, since the fire he brought was the first reversion of mankind from primordial temperance and, eventually, the first step to civilization, which brought with itself effeminacy, laxity and surplus of pleasures. Although patterns of natural temperance were found in mythical world, cynics believed that this world may and should be translated into reality. Continual askesis practice of temperance for both body and soul was regarded as the only instrument for such a realization. According to cynics, body must be strengthened by gymnastics, exercises of endurance and manual work whereas soul must be fortified by education.									0	0	0	0	0	0868-7692		WOS:000322849100006

We start from the conception of literary discourse as a discourse, if it qualified for the operation marked some dynamics or specific goals that lead us to designate it as literature, while we attribute the characteristic of being an act of language. These two principles, we apply the essential assumption according to which each has a web address for a configuration based semantic language that combines four fundamental levels: topical, expository, argumentative and locutionary. And to generate a broader framework, we have incorporated the plane of the imaginary, as a perspective that places de literary discourse, the discourse en general, in an anthropological and discursive context that allows further features and mechanisms configuration. This theoretical approach is accompanied by an application to Las Coplas a la Muerte de su padre by Jorge Manrique.									0	0	0	0	0	0034-849X		WOS:000322441800002

PARENTAL WEBSITE-DESCRIPTIONS OF CHILDREN'S IMAGINARY COMPANIONS								PSYCHOLOGICA BELGICA				53	1			117	124					2013	2013	Past research shows that imaginary companions are a normal phenomenon in childhood and do not indicate risk for psychopathology. The aim of this study was to see if parents are nevertheless concerned about imaginary companions. Internet-forums were searched in English, German, and Dutch in order to answer this question. Parental messages about present imaginary companions were analysed. Analyses of 89 posts made on a diverse set of internet-forums for parents revealed that half the parents expressed concerns about imaginary companions, especially parents with children older than 4.5 years old. When the imaginary companion was older than the child, parents were more likely to be concerned. Almost all messages were about imaginary companions, which might indicate that parents are less concerned about personified objects. The results signify that parents need more information in order to ensure they know imaginary companions are a normal childhood-experience.									0	0	0	0	0	0033-2879		WOS:000317702800007

A context historically besieged by slashing exclusionary practices, and more recently by accelerated territorial urbanizing and corporatization processes, that have increasingly been disrupting its inhabitants' daily lives. This research seeks to "capture" realities through voices, images and narratives from subjects living or moving around the neighborhood in order to unveil urban imaginaries. Likewise there is a desire to rescue an "erotic" dimension to this neighborhood, which purpose is nothing else but let us to get seduced by the multiples meanings that we as readers get from the metaphorical woof woven by urban discourses, where ludic and symbolic powers transcend market interests and space structural functionality.	Resumen Esta reflexión es resultado de un acercamiento semiológico a discursos y prácticas de moradores, habitantes y visitantes del barrio Getsemaní en Cartagena de Indias.

Se busca "captar" realidades a través de voces, imágenes y relatos de los sujetos que habitan o circulan el barrio y desde allí develar imaginarios urbanos; de igual manera, se quiere rescatar una dimensión "erótica" del Barrio, que no es otra cosa que dejarse seducir por las múltiples significaciones que como lectores aprehendemos de esa trama metafórica de los discursos urbanos; donde las potencias lúdicas y simbólicas sobrepasan los intereses del mercado y la funcionalidad estructural de los espacios.

A Finno-Ugric-speaking group that served as a buffer between Muscovy and the Khanate of Kazan' until it was brought under Moscow's rule in the sixteenth century, the Mari have had a reputation for sorcery from early travelers' accounts up until the twenty-first century. Such a reputation is shared by numerically small and militarily powerless subject populations around the world, and is often interpreted as a mechanism of exclusion. Looking at accounts from non-Mari residents of the Volga region of how they encountered and interacted with Mari magical powers during the Soviet and post-Soviet eras, I argue that at least in recent times, the reputation for sorcery does not constitute grounds for ostracism. Rather, it provides Maris with a niche in a local system of ethnic interdependence, and occasionally, with recognition at a national scale. In a situation where the definition of officially sanctioned religion is fluid and open to contestation, labeling the assumed powers of not-fully-Christianized people as "magic" helps incorporate them into a larger imaginary of spiritual agency, where boundaries between religious systems are less important than the movement between complementary ways of enlisting superhuman help. Representations of Mari witchcraft at a national and regional scale emphasize familiarity, not insurmountable strangeness, and thereby construct a narrative of Russian national strength as rooted in the state's ability to incorporate and bridge multiple ways of knowing and being.									0	0	0	0	0	0094-288X		WOS:000325748400011

In psychophysical experiments with a single set of Muller-Lyer wings, subjects were asked to place an imaginary reference rectangle into a position that made the apex of the wings appear to be at the rectangle center. Three different stimulus parameters (the length, internal angle, or tilt angle of the wings) were used as independent variables in different series of experiments. It was demonstrated that the magnitude of perceptual displacements of stimulus terminator is commensurate with that of illusions of extent obtained in our previous studies of full versions of illusory figures. Good correspondence between the experimental data and the predictions of our computational model of automatic centroid extraction strongly supported the suggestion that the effects of centroid extraction are powerful enough to be considered as one of the main causes of illusions of extent of the Muller-Lyer type.									0	0	0	0	0	0065-1400		WOS:000326205600010	24129490

Are health and disease just a matter of fact or are they value-laden? Here we present some examples of how alleged diseases can be invented and propagated by the industry (disease mongering) or by the methodology of medical science itself. We show that the boundary between health and disease is blurred and depends on individual and social representations, culture relative ways of categorising things and people, and by the society's degree of medicalisation. However, we do not mean that it is not real, rather that it is more complex than expected, as the subjectivity of social constructions and individual experiences makes them no less real. Finally, we conclude that health and disease belong to both objective and subjective kinds of reality, so the fictional can be real.									0	0	0	0	0	0210-1963		WOS:000326883200005

From a theoretical perspective based on the latest theoretical developments on nationalism, and particularly those concerning the role of culture, the article seeks to place the cinema in the heart of the study of Spanish nation-building process in the first decades of the twentieth century. The analytical axis will be the examination of the filmic construction of the regional imaginaries as a representation of Spain. After some general considerations concerning the presence of regional and national imaginaries in Spanish cinema, the article will focus specifically on the analysis of the filmic production of imaginaries related to the regions of Andalusia and Aragon from the detailed study of some representative films from the years of the Second Republic. In addition to film analysis, it will be also taken into account the critical reception of these films in the press and their social impact.									0	0	0	0	0	0018-2141		WOS:000326612000007

Contrary to Propp, we do not argue for the historic anteriority of archaic initiation rites for mythical ritualized belief-tales, nor for those fictional de-ritualized (the fairy-tales); we neither argue for their structural simultaneity (Levi-Strauss). What we do is trying to give an answer in the terms of a cognitive anteriority and of a mythic-fictional pre-eminence. Our solution takes its point of departure in the idea that there exists a plurality of mythical-fictional worlds (Eco, Pavel, Meinong, Parsons) and of logical worlds (Kripke), as well as in the meta-historic approach (in terms of a re-defined historicity) of the relation between the immediate world and the other possible worlds. The process of mythification/fictionalisation is expressed by three inter-dependent themes: the immediate experience of a sacred reality (Eliade) and the mental experience of the mind game type (Culianu), the theme of ideal objects (Culianu) / fictional (Pavel) and, last but not least, the explanation of the genesis of cultural facts (as well as the religious ones). In this context, we analyse the fictional mechanisms through which the belief-tale passes from the condition of object of experience to that of ideal/fictional object, transgressing its epistemic coordinates. It is a reversible process, meaning that the mythical-fictional cycle, brought to a certain degree of mythic and fictional formalization, returns to the initial point, projecting over immediate experience the mental patterns of the imaginary. The following topics are addressed: the relationship rite - myth - fairy-tale and the hypothesis of the origin of the fairy-tale (Propp and Meletinski), the problem of the experiential origin of folk facts and of the mythic-symbolic conversion of reality (Eliade), the genesis of ideal objects (as mythic-narrative traditions), the cognitive rules and their transmission (Culianu), the structure of fictional objects, the ontologic status of mythic-fictional beings, the fictional situs of the belief-tale (Propp), the mythical-fictional veridicity and credibility (Propp, Pavel, Searle & Gabriel, Eco, Todorov), the fictional simulation and transvesting (Pavel), the fictionalisation of myth and the plurality of competing ontologic paysages (Pavel, Eliade). The theoretic-literary model we proposed is situated at the crossroads between proppian morphology, hermeneutical thesis Mircea Eliade's, a semiology of cognitive inspiration (loan Petal Culianu) and an integrationist theory of the fictional (Pavel).									0	0	0	0	0	0034-8198		WOS:000326992400005		
J	Goldsztein, Sasha; Duret, Isabelle								Family heritage and the sense of existence among suicidal teenager								THERAPIE FAMILIALE				34	2			301	315					2013	2013	We shall expose the results of a research on 16 adolescents hospitalized after a suicidal attempt. The study supposes that the adolescent, throughout his action, claims the uniqueness and authenticity of his existence. The clinical interviews, combined with systemic evaluation tools (free and imaginary genograms), lead out onto different results. If with some adolescents the will to exist predominates over the will to die; others seem to await support and recognition of their differences by their environment.All of them show a lack of belonging feeling, which normally allows differentiation and gives a feeling of existence. As a result, the teenagers experience difficulties to feel registered in their filiation and to identify a constructive position in their genealogy. Taking into account those specificities, different therapeutic views will be suggested.									0	0	0	0	0	0250-4952		WOS:000326906000007

J	Giglioni, Guido								Learning to Read Nature: Francis Bacon's Notion of Experiential Literacy (Experientia Literata)								EARLY SCIENCE AND MEDICINE				18	4-5			405	434		10.1163/15733823-1845P0005			2013	2013	Francis Bacon's elusive notion of experience can be better understood when we relate it to his views on matter, motion, appetite and intellect, and bring to the fore its broader philosophical implications. Bacon's theory of knowledge is embedded in a programme of disciplinary redefinition, outlined in the Advancement of Learning and De augmentis scientiarum. Among all disciplines, prima philosophia (and not metaphysica) plays a key foundational role, based on the idea of both a physical parallelism between the human intellect and nature (psycho-physical parallelism) and a theological parallelism between nature and God (physico-theological parallelism). Failure to assess Bacon's distinctive position concerning the way in which the mind mirrors both the natural and the divine world, that is to say, the meaning of "reality," has resulted in notoriously jejune discussions on Baconian empiricism, monotonously driven by epistemological concerns. As a result, the standard view on Bacon's empiricism is as epistemologically comforting as it is imaginary, an "idol" in a genuinely Baconian sense. In this article, Bacon's notion of experience will be discussed by examining those steps that he considered to be the crucial initial stages in the formation of human experience, stages described as a process of experiential literacy (experientia literata) or, in emblematic terms, as a hunting expedition led by the mythological figure of Pan (venatio Panis). I argue that a well-rounded analysis of Bacon's experientia literata needs to take into account the complementary notion of the "spelling-book of nature" (abecedarium naturae), that is, the original code of the primordial motions of matter. By getting acquainted with the first rudiments of experience through its spelling-book (on both an individual and a cosmological level), one learns to read the book of nature and, most of all, to write new pages in it.									1	0	0	0	1	1383-7427		WOS:000327751900005

This can fuel new projects, or take root in protection through the constraints. Lurking around the corner, there is the relationship between utopia and its ideological fixation, until the formation of dystopia and 'bad place'. The present paper deals with the relationship between these categories, using, as paradigmatic background, the landscape of the squares ('campi' = 'fields') of Venice first and then the city of Almere, in which, in 1982 and 1985, took place the Architectural competitions for the districts of Fantasy and Reality.

As we will see, the influential Argentine statesman and writer creates, from a technologistic perspective, a wide variety of images and archetypes which can be traced in different publications. The aim of this paper is then to present these different types of symbolic features as a result of his technological attitude and to expose them according to a division that comprises four categories: the first one is devoted to images of an hostile nature; the second one examines the human archetypes he considers; the third one deals with the model nations (in particular, as a result of his trip to the United States), and the fourth one focuses on the treatment of scientists and engineers as heroes and agents of progress.									0	0	0	0	0	0210-5810		WOS:000328566400010

Language, sexuality and place: The view from cyberspace (Reprinted from Gender and Language, vol 5, pg 1-30, 2011)								GENDER AND LANGUAGE						V1		1	30		10.1558/genl.v5i1.1			2013	2013	This study attempts to use space/place as a tool in discourse analysis, focusing on the immediate surroundings of interaction. It investigates the ongoing performance of sexualised place (and place-based sexuality) through the use of language in online chat-rooms. The central questions focus on how the shared imaginary of a room helps to shape the performances of genders and sexualities unfolding 'there' and how the gendered and sexualised discourses sexualise the room. Guided by the triangle of space model (Gotved 2002, 2006), attention is paid to the chat rooms' user interface, the spatial metaphor of the 'room', and to participant interaction as part of the three dimensions of online spatiality. Analysis focuses on data taken from a corpus of computer-mediated chat-room interaction. These are queer places for performances (in this case) of non-heterosexual, masculine identities and desires, which are marginalized in our heteronormative society. Gotved's model of online spatiality allows linguistic analysis to demonstrate that social understandings of space and place interact with individuals and communities on a mutually reformulating path.									0	0	0	0	0	1747-6321		WOS:000328507200002

Through the post-traumatic mapping of Jonestown, Harris opens up a wide-ranging critique of terror in Guyana and other parts of the world. Representations of broken bodies and wounded communities call attention to the "precarity" of life - to borrow a term from Judith Butler - in a world where cultures of violence and ruthless economic imperatives prevail. Yet, at the same time, Harris's cross-cultural discourse represents a correlative to, and commentary on, Guyana as "a land of many waters", peoples, sacred traditions and cultures, offering a fluid reworking of local and global imaginaries through terror at the thresholds of the living and the dead, the human and non-human, the profane and the sacred.									1	0	0	0	1	1744-9855		WOS:000329065500004		
J	Stephansen, Hilde C.								Connecting the peripheries: networks, place and scale in the World Social Forum process								JOURNAL OF POSTCOLONIAL WRITING				49	5	SI		506	518		10.1080/17449855.2013.842773			2013	2013	Communication technologies occupy a central place in contemporary theorizations of transnational social movement networks. Not only does the internet provide the technical infrastructure through which activists communicate and share information, increasing their capacity to introduce oppositional messages into the public realm (Castells); its network architecture is also closely linked to the organizational logic of contemporary social justice movements (Juris). While recognizing the fundamental importance of communication technologies for such movements, this article cautions against overly disembodied conceptions of transnational activist networks and highlights the need to pay attention to issues of place and scale, as well as the importance of affect in the construction of alternative global imaginaries. Through a case study of a small social forum event held in February 2010 in a poor urban community in the south of Brazil as part of the World Social Forum process, the article examines activists' use of communication technologies to construct transnational networks between different place-based actors. It shows that these practices are not simply concerned with establishing links between already existing places; the creation of networks is also inextricably bound up with particular constructions of place. By engaging in a politics that is simultaneously place-based and global in scope, these actors challenge traditional conceptions of scale as well as dominant epistemological paradigms.									0	0	0	0	0	1744-9855		WOS:000329071200002		
J	Roof, Judith								Everett's Hypernarrator								CANADIAN REVIEW OF AMERICAN STUDIES				43	2			202	215		10.3138/cras.2013.012			2013	2013	The narrators of Percival Everett's many novels have become hypernarrators, fronting a far more complex, systemic, multidimensional effect that reflects the growing complexity and paradigmatic shifts of narrative itself. Insofar as narrators are an effect of the narrative, the narrators of Everett's later novels such as Erasure, American Desert, and Glyph, point to a species of narrative that produces a rich, polyvalent resonance from the dissonances of simultaneity and multidirectionality. Many of Everett's novels explore the construction and dimensionality of the narrator in narratives that destabilize any possibility of linearity, continuity, predictable cause/effect relationships, or correlations of signification. These narrators simultaneously expose the means by which narrators are constructed in narrative and extend and amplify the possibilities of narrators no longer tied to the imaginary Newtonian coordinates of impersonation.									0	0	0	0	0	0007-7720		WOS:000329444100004

If we draw this general idea by highlighting contemporary philosopher C. Castoriadis' thought about the project of autonomy referring to the social-historical process that produced the birth of the "polis" of Athens, thanks to the Greek political imaginary, and the French Revolution, starting from the transformation of the medieval religious society, then we can show which logical-ontological assumptions are the basis of this idea, as well as its specific and general condition and its actual expression, from the point of view of the praxis of social-historical transformation. To arrive at this result we need to evaluate critically the main ideas that Cornelius Castoriadis connects with the idea and the practice of autonomy, particularly the concepts of social-historical and politics. In this respect, we will be able to find, within Aldo Capitini's practical philosophy of religion, the confirmation of a credible ethical-political transposition of the above-mentioned assumptions.									0	0	0	0	0	1130-2097		WOS:000328572800017

Contemporary discourses show, on the one hand, a flow that leads the popular to the illustrated system. Furthermore, they show a plurality of junctions that leads us to propose a perspective on amplitude, rhizomatic, close to the creolization conceived by Edouard Glissant.									0	0	0	0	0	0716-0798		WOS:000329767300006

In this state, all archetypes (fire, air, water, light, earth) are manifested as “exalted cosmos” and are profoundly linked to human beings in a deep and happy communion: the exterior world is an aspect of the inner being. An animistic perception of existence is called up, a great consciousness in which everything exists and interrelates. This is because at the root of this contemplation as expressed in poetry there is a force that allows us to accept life with its intimate contradictions: “synthesis of sentiments that are contraries” (Bachelard) in the imaginary instant that it becomes word.	Los poemas de Ternura se construyen con imágenes de infancia permanente, en el sentido explicado por Bachelard: imágenes de la soledad impregnadas de ensoñación, que hacen ver el mundo en sus primicias. En este estado todos los arquetipos (el fuego, el aire, el agua, la luz, la tierra) se manifiestan en tanto “cosmos exaltado” y se vinculan raigalmente con el ser humano en una profunda y feliz comunión: el mundo exterior es un aspecto del ser interior. Se suscita así una percepción animista de la existencia, una gran conciencia en la que todo existe y se interrelaciona. Porque en la raíz de esa contemplación expresada en poesía hay una fuerza que permite aceptar la vida con todas sus contradicciones íntimas: “síntesis sentimental de los contrarios” (Bachelard) en el instante imaginario, devenido en palabra.								0	0	0	0	0	0718-0462		SCIELO:S0718-04622013000200013		
J	Azocar, Alonso; Nitrihual-Valdebenito, Luis; Flores-Chavez, Jaime								Patagonia in photographic postcards: Salesian missionaries and construction of imaginary about Selk'nam, kaweskar, and yamana between 1880 and 1920								ARTE INDIVIDUO Y SOCIEDAD				25	2			271	288		10.5209/rev_ARIS.2013.v25.n2.39040			2013	2013	At the end of the 19th century, Chile and Argentina occupied Patagonia with the goal of displacing or subjugating the indigenous peoples who lived there. Both countries commended the Salesian Mission with the task of evangelizing and "civilizing" these dominated groups, which entailed the construction of an image of "the other" or "the savage" by means of photographs which circulated in these two countries as well as in Europe. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Salesian Missionaries made postcards with such images and used them as "artifacts" to publicize their missionary work in "remote" and "exotic" locales. Their photographs of the Selknam, Kaweskar and Yamana peoples recreate mental images from their countries of origin which reproduce the old good and bad savage dichotomy. This discourse reveals certain aspects of the missionaries' social, economic and cultural reality and, at the same time, conceals, denies and provides a biased and partial view of that reality. The photographs analyzed in this paper are constructed from a Eurocentric and colonialist perspective.

Following critical antiracist feminist approaches, I highlight the relationship between race, class, and gender constructions that are crucial to colonial rule. Extending Chandra Mohanty's (1991) reading of Dorothy Smith's "relations of ruling," I outline six intersecting categories of colonial practices to examine Israel's particular colonization forms and processes. These categories include: racial separation; citizenship and naturalization forms and processes; construction and consolidation of existing social inequalities; gender, sexuality, and sexual violence; racialized and gendered prisoners; and "unmarked" versus "marked" discourses. Understanding colonial experiences as heterogeneous and plural, I conclude by arguing for the furthering of decolonial and antiracist feminist analyses from within specific sites of resistance.									0	0	0	0	0	0318-6431		WOS:000330217700004

This article draws on ethnographic research with white, working-class rural youth to develop an intersectional analysis of rural imaginaries. The analysis shows how youth construct their own rural identities through racialized representations of urban and global "others." I argue that these racist place-narratives must be understood in the context of competing discourses of rurality in Canada: the romanticized pure white rural of colonial history, and the pathologized poor white rural of a cosmopolitan future. Even as youth locate their gendered performances within the rural idyll, they are marked as "dirts" by their classed, rural status. By inscribing racist discourses onto others, youth resist the classist imagery projected onto their community and thereby reclaim a pure white rural idyll.									1	0	0	0	1	0318-6431		WOS:000330217700009		
J	Zezelj, Martina								Lacan's Reasoning of the Subject								FILOZOFSKA ISTRAZIVANJA				33	2			283	298					2013	2013	The main purpose of the paper is to point to the particularity of Lacan's reasoning of the subject. At the time of the structuralist reduction of the subject to the mere effect of structure, Lacan tends to preserve the concept of the subject. Despite that fact, Lacan does not directly follow up on the modern thought of the subject. It is the Cartesian cogito that is for him the foundation and object of criticism. With regards to the Cartesian cogito, Lacan finds disputable the self-founding of "I" in the act of its thinking. He claims that, even if we allow for the possibility of self-certitude arising from the consciousness itself, the question of how "I" can be conceived in this act remains unanswered. The part of the Cartesian subject that Lacan does adopt is the formation of the subject in the act of doubting. When considered in this context, Freud's procedure is Cartesian for Lacan, since Freud places special emphasis on doubting in the speech of the analysed in order to be able to conceive his unconscious. For Lacan, the subject is a split subject - a subject that is split by its Symbolic constitution into the imaginary ego and the subject of the unconscious. The discourse of the Symbolic has the constitution of a signifying chain, so the subject in the Symbolic is also reduced to the signifier. The meaning of the subject of the signifier does not encompass the subject of the unconscious, so the subject is alienated from its subject of the unconscious. The splitting that occurred within the subject by its subjection to the signifying constitution of the Other has repercussion on the subject's perception as well. In the act of perception the subject is split, since the objects are perceived by the ego, the subject of the signifier, and desired by the subject of the unconscious.									0	0	0	0	0	0351-4706		WOS:000329988600007

It confronts the stereotypical and misogynist vision of colonial women expressed by poets, travelers and Spanish officials with the experiences (if not the voices) of colonial women that emerge from archival records. The study of footwear as a cultural artifact enables us to explore the trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific connections that directly or indirectly pushed women to move between worlds, cultural imaginaries and social expectations.									0	0	0	0	0	1463-6204		WOS:000330389600004		
J	Frenkel, Ronit								South African Literary Cartographies: A Post-transitional Palimpsest								ARIEL-A REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ENGLISH LITERATURE				44	1			25	44					JAN 2013	2013	This article investigates three South African novels in an attempt to map the movement between transitional cultural production and post-transitional literature of the present. I briefly outline Phaswane Mpe's Welcome to our Hillbrou, (2001) as a formative text of the South African transitional period before discussing Kgebetli Moele's Room 207 (2006) and Ceridwen Dovey's Blood Kin (2007) as post-transitional texts. These novels all circle around issues of place and space, while also revealing the shifts in South African cultural history, as they comprise a set of related perspectives that inscribe meaning across times and spaces. I argue that a palimpsestic reading of this fiction opens up the possibility of reconceptualizing the relationship between space, place, and transnational connectivity. Each of the three texts under discussion writes the space of the city as a type of situated transnationalism where the local and the global exist as coeval discourses of signification. The fecundity of a palimpsestic reading lies in the revelation of how one transitional experience is already present in another. By inscribing one discursive act over another, the ruptures and continuities between textualizations reveal a wealth of imaginaries that, I argue, define the idea of post-transitional South African literature. But perhaps most importantly, the post-transitional can be read as a palimpsestic concept itself, much like the fiction explored in this article, in that it enables a reading of the new in a way in which the layers of the past are still reflected through it. Rather than moving in a temporal linear fashion, post-transitional literature creates a palimpsest in which we can read the imaginaries circulating through and shaping South African cultural formations today.									0	0	0	0	0	0004-1327		WOS:000331016400002		
J	김대중								Ontological Darkness and Hope in The Sound and the Fury			『소음과 분노』에 나타난 존재론적 암운과 희망					American Fiction Studies	미국소설			20	3			5	28					2013	2013	The Sound and the Fury, acclaimed as the epitome of Western modernism, resonates with the historicity of the early 20th century when fascism and exclusion of dehumanized human beings occurred in both reality and ontological topography. This paper aims to explore correlation between the novel and historicity of humanity. As a theoretical scaffolding, this paper uses Giorgio Agamben’s insight of the dire consequences of ontological and political scission between humanity and animality. After briefly and critically exploring several philosophers’ metaphysical endeavors to differentiate humanity from animality in Western philosophy, this paper reveals the limit and predicament of this ontological differentiation, which also results in the emergence of bio-politics mediated by ‘anthropological machine of exclusion.’ The novel embeds this ontological darkness and remaining hope Faulkner projected. In The Sound and the Fury, Benjy, a mentally-challenged character, play a role to reflect ontological status of dehumanized being. Faulkner uses Benjy not so much as a human character as an animalized metaphoric agent probing into the human condition in which bare life (zoe) is differentiated from political life (bio). Benjy remains as a ‘being with voice’ deprived of language though this voice as an ontological locus between language and sound reverberates to ontological ethos (ontological space) of being. Meanwhile, Quentin, a pseudo-tragic hero, embellishes the idea of tragic death so much that he even tries to dehumanize himself, as an imaginary exit to apotheosis. Both Benjy and Quentin are tethered to their ontological circle, or ‘the open’ as human-animals. Unlike other characters in the novel, Dilsey, a African American housemaid, represents universal humanity without scission between animality and humanity, which Agamben calls “form-of-life.”									0	0	0	0	0	1738-5784		KJD:ART001821768		
J	Chun, Dongho								Jacques-Louis David's The Oath of the Horatii			욕망하는 걸작: 자크 루이 다비드의 <호라티우스가의 맹세>					Art History and Visual Culture	미술사와 시각문화			12				32	57					2013	2013	Jacques-Louis David's The Oath of the Horatii, painted in 1785, has been widely regarded as the landmark piece to mark the advent of Neoclassicism. It deals with the story of the three sons of Horatius, heroes of the ancient Roman kingdom. The tale of the Horatii is based on the early Roman history written by Livy. Livy's history was dramatized by Corneille in the seventeenth century, and Corneille's play Les Horaces became extremely popular throughout the eighteenth century. The tale runs as follows. The three sons of Horatius were chosen to represent the city of Rome against the Curiatii, the three corresponding counterparts to fight for the neighboring city of Alba. The unexpected twist to the tale involves the tragedy that the two families were interconnected via marriage: one of the Horatii was married to a sister of the Curiatii, whereas their only sister, Camilla, was engaged to one of their enemies. The two parties fought to death with only one of the Roman combatants surviving. Thus Rome won the battle. The tale, nevertheless, had a violent twist to the end: the triumphant victor on his way back to Rome found his sister mourning her betrothed and slew her in patriotic rage. Their father, however, valuing loyaltiy to country above all else, sided with his son in front of Roman citizens and secured the son's exoneration. David's picture illustrates one imaginary moment in the story, the moment of taking oath to defend Rome to death, an episode which does not feature in any of the written sources. Traditional interpretations of this painting tend to regard it as the supreme embodiment of the doctrines of Neoclassicism and the philosophy of French state patronage system. The old views, however, are ill prepared to account for a recurrent pattern of inarticulate hostility toward David and his painting from those contemporary critics who were on the conservative side of the Academy of Painting and Sculture, which organized and managed the Salon exhibition where the picture was shown to the public at no cost. The painting's popular success at the Salon seems to them as something incomprehensible and vaguely threatening. What were they afraid of? What was the origin of their disagreement, their sense of crisis?Based on a close reading of contemporary art criticisms, this article seeks to chart the trajectory the painting has gone through. Revealing the unstable patterns and interplays between the ambitions of the artist and the ideological struggles among different interest groups, this paper argues for the significance of propaganda in the making and reception of a masterpiece and proposes the reconsideration of the painting within the framework of permanent dialogue between the circumstances it is viewed and the viewer's desires both tangible and intangible.				18세기 후반 프랑스의 대표적 화가 자크 루이 다비드(Jacques-Louis David)의 1785년 작품 <호라티우스가의 맹세 (Serment des Horaces)>는 가로 4.25m, 세로 3.3m 의 대형 캔버스에 등신대로 그려진 대작이다. 이 작품은 신고전주의(Neoclassicism)를 대표하는 회화로 신고전주의 입문서뿐만 아니라 서양미술사 개론서에도 빠짐없이 등장하는 그림이다. 그렇다면 수많은 신고전주의 작품가운데 도대체 이 작품의 무엇이, 그리고 어떻게 이 작품이 그렇게 커다란 명성을 획득하게 되었을까? 달리 말하자면 걸작은 어떻게 만들어지는 것일까? 본고는 이 작품이 만들어지게 된 역사적 배경과 이 작품을 둘러싼 당대의 비평을 소개하고 이를 비판적으로 분석하여 ‘걸작’의 탄생과 재탄생을 둘러싼 암투와 음모를 <호라티우스가의 맹세>를 통해 고찰해보려는 시도이다.					0	0	0	0	0	1599-7324		KJD:ART001812190		
J	Rhi, Juhyung								A Preliminary Thought on the Significance of Iconographic Configurations of Buddha Images from Early India			인도 초기 불상의 형상과 그 의미 시고(試考)					Art History and Visual Culture	미술사와 시각문화			12				192	227					2013	2013	After the creation of the Buddha image around the beginning of the Common Era, the most critical juncture in the history of Buddhist icons, at least within India, is probably the emergence of Buddha images in the middle Gangetic valley around the fifth to sixth century CE displaying the preaching gesture (dharmacakra-mudra) and the earth-touching gesture (bhumisparsa-mudra). These two image types present the Buddha clearly engaged in two important events from his life, theFirst Sermon and the Enlightenment. This is in stark contrast to earlier forms of the Buddha in iconic images, which feature little in the way of narrative. From this point on, these two types, especially the bhumisparsa, were the most common iconic images of the Buddha throughout later Buddhist art from India; they also simultaneously impacted other parts of the Buddhist world, such as Burma and later Thailand. In this paper, I return to the period before this important change took place in Indian Buddhismthat is, the centuries after the creation of the Buddha image (around the beginning of the Common Era)exploring the ways in which the Buddha was presented in iconic images and what significance we may be able to infer from their iconographic configurations. I touch on all three major centers of Buddhist art in this period, Gandhara, Mathura, and Andhra, the last comprising Amaravati and Nagarjunakoṇḍa, but focus inevitably on Gandhara, where a greater variety was shown in a significantly larger body of productions. An analysis in this papers clearly shows that diversebut a fairly limited number ofBuddha image types from early India had little to do with narrative moments of the Buddha’s life or specific Buddhas noted with special importance in contemporaneous Buddhist texts or cults. Perhaps the most noteworthy among the findings in this analysis is an interesting contrast between the dhyana-mudra type and the dharmacakra-mudra type, especially in Gandhara. These two types were not simply two concurrent types; instead, the two might have been related, or even used in contradistinction. The contrast between the two types is tantalizing, and Gandharan Buddhists possibly perceived their diverging significances, or even sometimes constructed it, through their mutual relationship, by the time the dharmacakra-mudra Buddha was established as another popular type. In dhyana-mudra, the Buddha is apparently deeply absorbed in meditation and is cut off from the outside world. In such depictions, the Buddha is static, withdrawn in the bliss of impenetrable enlightenment or solitary mental concentration (samadhi). Most images of the dharmacakra-mudra Buddha are shown in an abstract form, but the Buddha sometimes appears in the extraordinary narrative setting of the Indrasailaguha framed in a magnificent stele. On the other hand, in dharmacakra-mudra, the Buddha is activewhether the action is preaching, reception, or approval, if it can be glimpsed in examples, though limited in numbers, of its use in narrative depictions. He is no longer in a state of self-absorption, but conspicuously engages with the imaginary audience or viewers. In its advanced form, in complex steles, for instance, such as one from Mohammed-Nari, the dharmacakra-mudra is coupled with a grandiose lotus seat, with which the Buddha overlaps. In this act of the Buddha, its original significancewhatever it waswas further exalted, or perhaps even another layer of meaning was added. The rolling water from which the lotus emerges suggests fluidity, as if violently moving toward creation. It reminds one of an ocean, highlighted in a number of Buddhist scriptures, rather than a tranquil pond of Sukhavati, as the Amitabha theorist would have us believe. The Buddha seems to emerge from the rolling water along with or like the lotus. Or, viewed in contrast with dhyana-mudra Buddhasparticularly one that appears in a magnificent depiction of the Indrasailaguhathis Buddha looks as if he has been roused out of meditative quiescence.				불상의 창안 이후 굽타시대(4-5세기)에 이르기까지 인도 초기 불상 조상사에서 흥미로운 현상은 <초전법륜>이나 <성도> 등 불전(佛傳)의 중요한 사건과 명시적으로 관련된 독립 불상이 전혀 존재하지 않는다는 사실이다. 그렇다면 그 시기에 불상은 어떤 의미를 나타내도록 도상적으로 구성된 것인가? 혹은 초기 불상의 도상적 구성은 어떤 의미를 지니는 것인가? 이 논문은 이러한 문제를 탐색한다.					0	0	0	0	0	1599-7324		KJD:ART001812203

According to Walter Benjamin, metropolitan experience molds deprivation and depression and metropolitan life of technological era expands the subjective experience. Apart from the dramatic performances and paintings the movie is regarded as an analyzable tool to separate objects by elevating the width of the senses of human. This cinematic facet promotes interpenetration of both art and intellect. Besides Benjamin seeks the ubi sunt motif in Napoli, Italy. It shows metropolitan porosity of Napoli which mingles with the spaces between public and private. The concept of porosity is improvisation and resuscitation of daily life itself. Interpretation of neapolitan porosity is rather resembled Seoul in the middle of 1950s. Seoul where is the metropolis both self-contented eulogy for progress and conquest of nature discloses as the space of allegorical ruins through Holiday in Seoul. This study is to interpret 1950s Seoul reflected on cinematic image immediately after Korean War with allegory of montage and investigate the imaginary value of neo-realism expressed by the experience of metropolitan city. Furthermore it intends to view from fetishistic desire of citizen and metropolitan landscape with Walter Benjamin’s viewpoint which is reflected on the transition era of modernity represented by impact and deprivation.				1956년의 한국영화 <서울의 휴일>은 변모하는 근대화의 대도시 속에서 문화적 충격과 상실을 경험하는 인물들을 네오리얼리즘의 영화적 시선으로 그려내고 있다. 벤야민에 따르면 아우라를 상실한 대도시의 경험은 상실과 우울을 체험하게 만들며, 대도시와 기술문명시대의 삶은 주체의 경험을 확대시킨다. 연극이나 회화와는 달리 영화는 인간의 감각의 폭을 높여줌으로써 사물들을 분리하여 분석가능한 도구로 보았다. 이러한 영화적 측면은 예술과 학문의 상호침투를 촉진시킨다. 또한 벤야민은 덧없음의 순간을 나폴리에서 찾는다. 사적 공간과 공적인 공간 사이의 혼합은 나폴리의 도시적 다공성을 보여준다. 이러한 다공성의 개념은 즉흥성과 일상생활에서의 재연 그 자체이다. 나폴리의 다공성 해석은 1956년의 서울과 매우 닮아 있다. 진보에 대한 독선적인 찬사와 자연정복의 현장인 대도시 서울은 영화 <서울의 휴일>을 통해 알레고리적인 폐허의 공간으로 드러나고 있다. 본 연구는 영화의 이미지를 통해 드러나는 한국전 직후 서울을 몽타주 알레고리로 재편집하고, 영화 속 대도시의 경험을 통해 표현되고 있는 네오리얼리즘적 이미지의 가치를 재발견할 것이다. 또한 과도기 근대화 당시의 충격과 상실시대를 산보하는 벤야민의 시선으로 대도시의 풍경과 도시인들의 물신적 욕망을 바라보고자 한다.					0	0	0	0	0	1598-9119		KJD:ART001821409		
J	장석오								The System and Meaning of Makara Appearing in Early Buddhist Art			古代 佛典에 나타난 마카라 문양의系統과 意味					BULKYOMISULSAHAK	불교미술사학			16				39	72					2013	2013	The System and Meaning of Makara Appearing in Early Buddhist ArtMakara(摩竭魚) is an imaginary animal of ancient India, a hybrid creature of crocodile, elephant and fish. It is called "Makara" in Sanskrit and Pali, and referred to as "Magar" in Indian. In Chinese-translated Buddhist sutras, it is recorded as "摩竭", "摩羯", "摩喝魚", "摩竭大魚", "摩伽羅", and "麼迦羅魚". The Makaras in ancient Indian texts have been interpreted as signs of "ocean"or "sea creature". In terms of iconography, they are also understood as the origin of life. The most significant iconic features of Makaras are long noses,wide open mouths showing sharp teeth, and fish tails. The Makara image was passed onto East Asia along with merchandise trade between the East and West, and the spread of Buddhism into the East. In particular, sutras with records of Makara were passed onto China from around 3 A.D. With such unique formal features, it is not difficult to recognize certain monsters ornamented on artifacts as Makaras. However, as ornament patterns are bound to be modified with time, it is not easy to classify the genealogy of Makaras on various artifacts and understand their meanings. Analyzing contemporary texts is crucial in establishing the genealogy and apprehending the meaning of Makara ornaments, because texts provide a guideline as to what kind of significance Makara ornaments held for their contemporary people. Therefore, analyzing the contemporary texts and sutras translated into Chinese in the ancient times is a sine qua non in grasping the signification of Makara ornaments in Buddhist art. In this text, I looked over Makara-related records, period by period, with focus on sutras passed onto China. Then I reconstructed the genealogy and 불교미술사학 제16집72significations of the Makara patterns portrayed on Indian, Central Asian,Chinese, and Korean artifacts. Through such process, I was able to connect the genealogies of Makara ornaments to each country and also grasp the true meaning of each Makara design. The green glazed brick of Four Heavenly Kings found in the Temple of Four Heavenly Kings is a Makara design that conveys the architectural instructions of Mahasaṃghika Vinaya(摩訶僧祇律), while the gilt-bronze standing Avalokitesvara excavated in Seonsan is that of ornamental patterns in Abhidharmavibhaṣa-sastra(阿毘曇毘婆沙論), the ocean voyage pattern-copper mirror(煌丕昌天鏡) is that of the water disasters in Yoga-carya-bhumi-sutra(修行道地經),and the mirror inscribed with Makara among clouds(摩竭流雲文鏡) that signifies the sea creature of Madhyamagama(中阿含經). Such Makara designs of ancient and medieval Korea, as their expressions of detail can be compared with those of Goryeo's turtle shaped bases and dragons shaped heads of monuments(龜趺·螭首), reflect the unique identity of Korean art. While conveying the uniqueness of Korean art, the overall image is also comparable with that of India, Central Asia and China, asserting the internationality of ancient and medieval Korean art that (in)directly interacted with other nations. The Makara design indigenous to India was passed onto East Asia, broadening the horizon of ornamental patterns and sign systems in many countries including Central Asia, China, and Korea.									0	0	0	0	0	1738-0227		KJD:ART001815999

The research of transparency has been studied mainly in terms of visual aspects and ideas in space design. However, the study of transparency in terms of new media are now beginning. This study of transparency in terms of new media focus on the digital pattern, imaginary grid and futuristic color than video. The purpose of study is to identify Karim Rashid's design strategy that is three-dimensional effects through transparency from the virtual grid environment. Research method is to recognize the concept of transparency to understand the general design features and design philosophy of Karim Rashid. The main design features include: Pursuit of organic design, Trend of Geometric minimalism, The mix of digital space and color, Representation of virtual space. This design features has become the basis of the trend and effects of a transparent design. The main point of his design sensibility is the shape of curves and the epidermal pattern with digital geometric and organic curves. The tendency of transparency in his designs have shown various aspects.- using of transparent plastics material, interpenetration through the open the walls and windows, the three-dimensional representation of using light, three-dimensional using virtual grid, and transparency representation by user participation. From the above, the digital pattern & transparency of Karim Rashid’s Works in new media space design is pioneering a new genre.				투명성(transparency)은 맑게 잘 보이는 물질적인 면과 깨끗하고 청결하며 순수한 느낌의 관념적 투명성으로 구분 할 수 있다. 그동안의 공간디자인의 투명성 연구는 시각적인 면과 관념적인 면에 연구가 되어왔는데, 뉴 미디어 측면의 투명성 연구는 이제 시작 단계라고 볼 수 있다. 본 연구는 미디어적 투명성 연구가 동영상과 같은 영상물에 중점을 두기 보다는 디지털 패턴이나 가상의 그리드를 통한 입체적 환경으로 투명적 효과를 이용하고 있는 카림 라시드의 디자인 전략을 파악하는 것이다. 연구방법은 투명성의 개념을 인식하고 카림 라시드의 디자인 철학과 일반적 디자인 특징을 이해한다. 주요 디자인 특징으로는 유기적 디자인추구, 빛과 색채의 환상적 표현, 디지털패턴과 공간색채의 혼용, 디지털패턴과 가상공간 표현 등 4가지로 요약된다. 이러한 디자인특징은 본 연구의 핵심내용인 디지털 패턴 등을 이용한 투명적 디자인효과와 경향의 토대가 되고 있다. 그의 디자인의 주된 감성 포인트는 형태적으로는 곡선을, 표피의 패턴은 디지털적인 기하곡선과 유기적곡선이다. 또한 디자인에서 투명적 경향은 다양한 양상을 보이고 있다. 플라스틱류의 투명재료 이용, 열려진 벽과 창을 통한 공간의 상호관입, 빛을 이용한 입체적 표현, 가상 그리드를 이용한 입체감, 그리고 사용자의 공간 참여에 의한 투명성 표현 등이 특징이다. 이상에서 살펴본 카림 라시드의 디지털 패턴과 투명성은 뉴 미디어적인 공간디자인에서의 새로운 장르를 개척하고 있다 하겠다.					0	0	0	0	0	1598-8635		KJD:ART001817372		
J	Oh, JinHee								A study on the fantasy made by the combination of real space and disparate characters in Korean short Animation films			한국 단편애니메이션의 현실공간과 이종 캐릭터의 결합에 의한 판타지 연구					Bulletin of Korean Society of Basic Design & Art	기초조형학연구			14	1			281	295					2013	2013	Generally, the world of fantasy is directly presented through spectacular images in the visual arts including cinema and animation. The imaginary world is expressed through clearly discernible external differences from the real world and universally makes use of connecting structures through channels, which are dramatic turning devices. Even in text-centered media such as literature, the imaginary world is described visually, with an emphasis on its differences from the real world. The dramatic development of digital technology has qualitatively changed ways of manufacturing and implementing the display of audiovisual media and makes possible the nearly perfect realization of images of the imaginary world. However, the imaginary world in certain Korean short animation films is presented without passing through special spaces, with its appearance in the real world intact, and is characterized by its realization of the world of fantasy through unique narratives where real spaces and disparate characters are combined. By being situated in representationally described real spaces, disparate characters, which can be animals, plants, or objects, at once express the worlds of imagination and reality. Thus purposely disregarding spectacular images and representing real spaces leads to the highlighting of the themes while relying more on narratives than on visual directness. Leaving behind imagistic levels of the real world directly informs viewers that world is not removed from reality and even more faithfully reveals the dark side of reality, which is one of the originally roles of fantasies. Consequently, works in Korean short animation films that create the world of fantasy without relying on images of imaginary spaces must be taken note of as alternative examples that express the dark side and essence of reality in special ways.				영화와 애니메이션을 포함한 시각예술에서 판타지 세계는 직접적인 스펙터클 이미지로 제시되는 것이 일반적이다. 디지털 기술의 급속한 발전은 영상매체의 제작과 디스플레이 구현방식을 질적으로 변화시켰고 상상세계의 이미지 구현을 실재에 근접시키고 있다. 상상세계는 실재의 재현이 아니면서도 실감나는 구현을 위해 그 세계 안에서의 사실성에 의해 정교하게 묘사된다. 다른 맥락에서 문학과 같은 텍스트 중심의 매체에서도 상상세계는 현실세계와 다르게 묘사된다. 그런데 일부 한국 단편애니메이션의 상상세계는 특별한 공간을 경유하지 않고 현실세계의 외형 그대로 제시된다. 그리고 현실공간과 동물, 식물, 사물 등의 이종 캐릭터를 독특한 방식으로 결합하여 판타지 세계를 구현한다. 재현적으로 묘사된 현실공간에 위치하는 이종 캐릭터는 상상과 현실의 세계를 동시에 표현한다. 이처럼 의도적으로 스펙터클 이미지를 외면하는 것은 시각적 직접성보다 서사에 기대어 주제를 부각하는 결과를 낳는다. 판타지 세계에 현실의 이미지 층위를 남기는 것은 그 세계를 현실과 동떨어진 것이 아니게 하며, 역으로 현실의 이면을 드러내는 판타지 본래의 역할에 충실하게 한다. 이 연구에서는 상상공간에 의존하지 않고 판타지세계를 창조하는 한국 단편애니메이션 작품을 통해 현실의 이면과 본질을 표현하는 판타지 미학과 그것을 구현하는 특별한 방법론의 의미에 대해 강조하였다.					0	0	0	0	0	1598-8635		KJD:ART001747392		
J	Lee, Moonjung								Identity and hybridity in a human body sculpture of Robert Gober			로버트 고버의 인체 조각에 나타난 정체성과 잡종성					Bulletin of Korean Society of Basic Design & Art	기초조형학연구			14	5			359	370					2013	2013	Robert Gober is an artist who conducts works at a cross of sex, politics, and religion from the initial days of his works to the present day. He makes suppressed social structure, stereotype, and consideration about power which makes them possible, and sexual identity to cross. This tendency is prominent in a human body sculpture of torso among his works. His sculpture of a human body exists as a strong mechanism of subversion which dismantles power relations between sex, society, and religion. His torso emphasizes materiality and corporeality of a human being and express unclear and diverse identities by combining and colliding different parts of a body. A monster-like human body, which is combined with androgyne, adult birth, and a wooden bloc and whose identity is mysterious, of a torso dismantles biological, sociopolitical and religions standards which is an expression of social disconnection and wounds of a homosexual, and suggests a new hybrid identity. Lastly, his sculpture of a human body comes down to dreaming of return to the imaginary from the symbolic where everything is divided and defined by rules. Hybridity, which was considered to be a negative property until modernism era, is transformed into a positive property which transcends narrow classification, suppression by standards, and rules of the symbolic through a human body sculpture, and acquires the wholeness where all identities co-exist.				로버트 고버(Robert Gober)는 작업 초기부터 현재까지 성(性), 정치, 그리고 종교의 교차점에서 작업을 진행하는 예술가이다. 그는 억압된 사회 구조와 스테레오타입(stereotype), 그것을 가능하게 만드는 권력에 대한 숙고와 성 정체성을 교차시킨다. 이러한 경향은 고버의 작업 중 인체 조각에서 두드러지는데, 그의 인체 조각은 개인의 정체성과 사회 구조 사이의 권력 관계를 해체하는 전복의 기제로서 기능한다. 고버의 인체 조각은 몸의 서로 다른 부분들을 결합하고 충돌시켜 인간의 물질성과 육체성을 강조하고 다채로운 정체성을 표출시킨다. 토르소(torso)에서 재현되는 정의내릴 수 없는 안드로진(androgyne)의 육체, 가슴에서 우유처럼 물을 쏟아내는 그리스도는 이분법적인 성 정체성과 사회의 고정 관념을 해체하고 새로운 다양성을 획득하기 위한 시도이다. 또한 성인의 출생(adult birth), 나무토막과 결합된 채 출산하고 있는 괴물 같은 인체는 동성애자로서 갖게 되는 사회적 단절과 상처의 발현인 동시에 정체성을 판단하는 생물학적이고 사회정치적이며 종교적인 기준을 와해시키고 새롭게 태어나는 잡종적 정체성을 제시한다. 최종적으로 그의 인체 조각은 규범에 의해 모든 것이 나뉘고 한정되는 상징계(the symbolic)를 벗어나 상상계(the imaginary)로의 회귀를 꿈꾸는 것으로 귀결된다. 모더니즘 시기까지 부정적인 속성으로 간주되던 잡종성은 고버의 인체 조각을 통해 편협한 분류와 기준에 의한 억압, 상징계적 규범이 갖고 있는 한계를 넘어서는 긍정적 항(項)으로 전환되어 모든 정체성이 공존하는 전체를 획득한다.					0	0	0	0	0	1598-8635		KJD:ART001817457

Lots of studies on published cartoon focus on the cut direction by page, but webtoon doesn't have any concept of page. The pivot of cartoon oriented people is changed from paper to computer monitor as times go by, characteristics of media are changed and media is gradually diversified. Like the strengthening of mobile caused by smart phone's popularity, tablet PC' s propagation in public education, etc. cartoon is included to the environment of media which is rapidly changed. In this situation, one of cartoon's unchanged important identities can be the direction made by harmony between picture and text. This thesis analyzed symbolic characteristics and effective value of hyogwatae, mimetic words of cartoon, focusing on works of Heo, Young Man. Hyogwatae just delivers not only sound but also shape, feeling, status, etc. and has significant characteristics by invoking the imaginary structure of literature. Strengths of modern Korean, various linguistic expressions and syllabic systems, let people feel minute feeling of language and difference of emotion and remember the memory through the direct and indirect experiences, so it makes it nuance. Because of the characteristics, representative works of Heo, Young Man have commercialization and writer characteristics, have communicated with people for a long time and have plentiful knowledge of Korean cartoon. The characteristics of hyogwatae in Heo, Young Man's cartoon make a lot of effects for the expression and delivery of cartoon more than the general expectation. When conducting the study focusing on the symbolic process of language, uncertainty and vague standard of judgement caused by the wide factors of study on the direction of general cartoon could be endured. And, through the Heo, Young Man's deep analysis on hyogwatae's direction, readers enjoy the process while inferring actually and intellectually between pictures and sentences. In the process, the equipment stimulating imagination more than pictures, effects and dialogues is hyogwatae. It's reader's equipment of active participation and its strength is symbolic structure.				만화에서의 다양한 연출은 웹툰의 대중화와 함께 세로 스크롤 연출이 기존의 출판만화의 페이지 연출과 대립하는 양상을 보이며 새로운 장르를 구축해냈다. 많은 출판만화의 연구가 페이지를 위시한 컷 연출에 초점을 두고 있지만, 웹툰에는 페이지의 개념이 없다. 대중 지향의 만화는 시대의 변화에 따라 구심점이 지면에서 컴퓨터 모니터로 옮겨가며 매체의 특성 또한 달라졌으며, 매체는 점점 다원화되고 있다. 스마트폰의 유행으로 인한 모바일의 강세, 공교육에서의 태블릿 PC의 보급화 전망과 같이, 만화는 급변하는 매체환경에 속해있다. 이러한 상황에서도 만화의 변하지 않는 중요한 정체성중의 하나를 꼽자면 그림과 텍스트의 조합이 만들어 내는 연출이다. 이 논문에서는 허영만의 작품을 중심으로 만화 의태어인 효과태가 가진 상징어적인 특성과 효용가치를 분석하였다. 효과태는 단지 소리뿐만이 아니라 모양, 느낌, 상태 등을 전달하며 문학적 상상구조를 발동시킴으로써 함축적 특성을 가진다. 현대국어의 장점인 다양한 언어 표현과 자모체계는 미세한 어감과 정서의 차이점을 느끼게 해주며 직접 경험과 간접 경험을 통한 기억을 떠올려서 뉘앙스화하기 때문이다. 이러한 특징들로 인해서 허영만의 대표작들은 상업성과 작가성을 동시에 지니고 오랜 세월동안 대중과의 소통을 해왔으며 한국적인 만화의 소양을 풍부하게 가지고 있다. 허영만의 만화에 나타난 효과태의 특징은 만화의 표현과 전달에 있어서 일반적인 기대 이상으로 효과태가 미치는 영향이 크다는 것을 알 수가 있다. 피수용자인 독자는 그림과 글 사이에서 적극적으로 지적인 추리를 하면서 그 과정 자체를 즐기며, 그러한 과정에 대사 텍스트 이상으로 상상력을 자극하는 장치가 효과태이며, 효과태는 상징적 구조를 장점으로 하는 독자의 능동적 참여 장치이다.					0	0	0	0	0	1738-009X		KJD:ART001757282

First, this study considers Jangseung and Dokkaebi that appear frequently in the Korean traditional culture, and prepares a way to try to develop the Korean hybrid characters. To do this, I analyze examples of hybrid characters direction in as-found animation characters, and grasp the meaning of it. Hybrid character is classified as a character produced by mix and combination of shape and a character produced by shape exaggeration. And I shed new light on characters and meanings of Jangseung and Dokkaebi remaining as cultural assets. Through this, the study wants to help handling measure about a problem of character that the Korean animation has. Therefore, this study looks characters of description about imaginary creatures expressed in existing animations, and wants to shed new light on the Korean Jangseung and Dokkaebi regarded as from an object of folk religion and custom, to an object that is possible to use in the Korean traditional character development.				본 연구는 애니메이션에서 나타나는 하이브리드 캐릭터의 형상을 살펴보고 창의적인 한국형 캐릭터 개발과 대중매체에서 재생산될 수 있는 전통 문화의 재현을 위한 확장된 담론을 제시하고자 한다. 먼저, 한국전통문화에서 빈번하게 등장하는 장승과 도깨비를 고찰하고 한국형 하이브리드 캐릭터의 개발을 시도하기 위한 방안을 마련하였다. 이를 위하여 기존 애니메이션 캐릭터에서 하이브리드 특징을 연출한 사례를 분석하여 의미를 파악하였다. 하이브리드 캐릭터는 형태의 조합 및 결합으로 생성된 캐릭터와 형태의 과장으로 생성된 캐릭터로 분류되었다. 그리고 문화재로 남아있는 장승과 도깨비의 특징과 의미를 재조명하였다. 이를 통해, 한국 애니메이션이 가진 캐릭터의 문제점 극복 방안에 도움이 될 수 있는 사항을 구축하고자 한다. 이에 본 논문은 기존의 애니메이션들 속에서 표현된 상상의 동물에 대한 묘사의 특성을 살펴보고, 한국적인 캐릭터 개발에 활용할 수 있도록 민속 신앙과 풍속의 대상으로만 여겨졌던 한국의 장승과 도깨비를 한국 전통 캐릭터 개발에 활용 가능한 대상으로 재조명할 수 있는 기회를 마련하고자 한다.					0	0	0	0	0	1738-009X		KJD:ART001788858

Although there were some disturbances like An Lushan's Rebellion, however, it still had spiritual richness. Poets composed plenty of poems, while crisscrossing the entire country, and they can show their ability without any external restrictions that suppress the freedom of expression. The excellent senses of color in their poems illustrate these spiritual richness and the freedom of expression. And the poets of T'ang dynasty were absorbed in writing modern style poems which the aesthetics of juxtaposition is regarded as a very important element. The color terms used in the juxtaposition were a point of contact between the sense of color and the regulated verses. In this paper, I examined those color terms in order to capture the essences of T'ang dynasty's regulated verses. The first investigation was focused on the location and types of which the color terms used frequently. Many examples were founded at the first character both in five-character verses and seven-character verses. T'ang poets combined two or more color terms in their poem, and achieved magnificent effects such as contrasts of similarity, brightness, and chroma. The second point are the characteristics of the usage of color terms. This includes the prefference of color terms and the influences of several major poets. I suggested three substantial preferred color terms, that is ‘Blue 靑’, ‘Yellow 黃’, ‘Red 紅’, besides structural prefferred color term ‘White 白’. The Three major poets like Li Bai 李白, Du Fu 杜甫, Bai Juyi 白居易 showed remarkable achievements and influences with regard to distinctive command of color terms. Finally, I presented some of the concrete examples that T'ang poets used the color terms in their poems aesthetically. They had an ability enough to arrange color terms chromatically, and to discover the beauty of color. They also attempted some techniques to increase the effects of poetics such as disharmonic combination, separation, and manifesting synesthesia when using the color terms. Specially, the effective fusion of real color and imaginary color was an ambitious work that could articulate the traditional aesthetic sense of Chinese culture.									0	0	0	0	0	1226-2943		KJD:ART001821647		
J	은은숙								Education-Philosophical Implication of Subject in J. Lacan and J. Piaget			라캉과 피아제 주체 개념의 교육철학적 함의― 수학교육을 중심으로 ―					CHULHAK-RONCHONG, Journal of the New Korean Philosophical Association	철학논총			74	4			407	430					2013	2013	The notion of subjectivity is crucially important to education research in that we can not be insensitive to the alternative needs of learners, their teachers and the communities with which they associate. Piaget supposes progression through a sequence of predetermined stages. The educational objects in Piaget’s epistemology are known through action more than signs. Piaget therefore underplays the productive role of the situated individual who gets to know these signs. He produces overly reductive conception of the student and teacher within the fabric of education research output. But Lacan’s three orders the imaginary, the symbolic and the real that make up his conception of the subject provide a pliable analytical framework for inspecting the wider ramifications of subjectivity in education research. Lacan’s conception of subjectivity does provides a way of thinking differently in which teachers, mathematics, students and the frameworks that define them are conceptualized as mutually evolving entities resulting from the play of discursive activity. So mathematics education research need to conceive other factors governing mathematical activity : emotion, mode of compliance and resistance of pupil, school context, affective dimensions of mathematics in particular learning site, conceptions of learning relation, etc. But in order to communicate each other and develop the mind, supposing the possibility of education, we need to suppose the universal thinking. So we need to synthesize Piaget’s theory of cognition and Lacan’s psychoanalysis.				주체 개념은 교육방법 또는 교육평가 등과 같은 구체적 대안을 위해서 뿐만 아니라 교육목적과 같은 교육의 일반 이념을 마련하려는 일체의 연구들에 있어서도 결정적으로 중요하다. 이런 맥락에서 최근 한 세기를 지배해온 교육학적 논의의 토대 개념은 피아제의 심리학적 주체 개념과 이것의 대척점을 이루는 비고스키의 사회학적 주체 개념이었다. 그런데 최근에 일고 있는 라캉의 정신분석학적 주체 개념은 양자의 자아 개념을 전체적으로 비판하면서 교육철학적 논의에 새로운 논쟁의 근거를 제공한다. 이에 라캉의 주체 개념을 상상계, 상징계 그리고 실재계 등과 같은 라캉 정신분석학의 핵심 개념들을 중심으로 간략하게 정리하고, 라캉의 주체 이론과 기표 이론에 내재한 교육철학적 함의를 도출하고자 한다. 그 다음에 라캉의 주체 이론에 상반되는 한 실례로서 피아제의 발생학적 인식론에서 논구된 보편적 주체 개념을 비판적으로 검토하고자 한다. 특히 이러한 보편적 인지 능력에 근거한 피아제의 환원주의 교육철학에 대한 라캉의 비판들을 분석하고자 한다. 연구자의 결론은 피아제의 인지발달이론과 라캉의 정신분석학은 종합되어야 한다는 것이다. 인식의 구조에 있어서 위계의 필연성과 보편성을 극단적으로 주장하는 피아제의 입장도 지나치다면, 각자는 각자의 주체를 가지고 있고 따라서 주체들 상호간에는 어떠한 일치나 보편성도 일종의 환상이라는 라캉의 입장도 극단적 회의론이다. 이에 양자의 인식론을 절충하는 제 3의 대안이 모색되어야 할 것이다.					0	0	0	0	0	1226-9379		KJD:ART001813861		
J	김성환								A study on the mode of representations of the subaltern in  Choi, In-ho’s The Eearthman			최인호의 지구인 에 나타난 하층민 재현 방식 연구					Cogito	코기토			74				223	255					2013	2013	Choi, In-ho’s The Eearthman.( 지구인 ) is similar to american crime stories in the early 20th century, which detect crimes and social meanings. The Eearthman is based on the real story of an armed robber in 1974. This famous story was made to a crime stories of new style that reconstructs the case and makes compositive meanings. the armed robbery happened in 1974 of Korea, when new order of industrialization rules everyday life of people. Choi’s novel shows two streams. The first is narrative of fall of character,the second is a organization of society, social order, and control power. In 1970’s autocracy system, the armed robbery was very unusual accident. But this robbery made people imagine a rupture of dictative order. The Eearthman was written by the real story and made narrative for searching the origin of the crimes and evil. What The Eearthman found is that origin of crimes is evil. Jongdae, the principal’s crime has social cause which is from absurdity. but writer excluded the sociality, and attributed all crimes to evil because of Jongdae’s evil was radical and inevitable. This point of description make the novel incomplete in narrative. Banality of evil make real Fears. Most Important device for evil narrative is gun. When Jongdae grip the gun, he was falling into evil. Gun is the Symbol of the power, rules and evil. The Eearthman’s Gun narrative reveals that as gun has imaginary identification, power of governmnet is on imaginary government system. The Eearthman has the sacrifice narrative, which showed the sacrifice was isolated by social system and in this sense, the sacrifice is the subaltern. the sacrifice was living under the inversed rule as circus. Their lives was placed in ‘makjang’(막장, ablind end), and their bodies was disabled. The Eearthman describe their lives can saved by religion.				1970년대 한국 사회의 변동을 포착한 지구인 은 소총강도 사건을 재현한 범죄소설의 유형으로, 범죄의 현장을 좇으며 범죄의 사회적 의미를포착하려 한다. 널리 알려진 사건을 장편소설로 형상화한 최인호의 작업은 사건자체의 재구성 이상의 의미화를 이루어낸다. 1970년대를 지배한자본주의적 질서를 소설은 몰락의 서사와 사회 구조에 대한 인식이라는두 주제로 형상화했다. 지구인 의 경우는 몰락의 상세한 과정은 물론, 이사건이 상기시키는 권력과 지배의 문제에도 큰 역량을 발휘하고 있다. 엄격한 사회 질서를 강요했던 1970년대의 상황에서 소총강도와 같은 극단적 범죄는 권력과 질서의 파열을 상상하게 만든다는 특징을 가지고 있다. 저널리즘 글쓰기나 에세이가 사회현상에 대해 상상이나 체험에만 근거한것에 비한다면 지구인 은 취재를 바탕으로 하되 범죄의 실질적인 기원을 파악하는 서사의 축을 구성함으로써 범죄소설의 한 유형을 만든 것으로 주목할 만하다. 지구인 에서 발견한 범죄의 기원은 ‘악’ 그 자체이다. 주인공의 범죄는 내용상 사회적 원인을 추측할 수 있는 사건이지만, 작가는 이를 배제하고 순수한 악 그 자체를 사건의 원인으로 돌린다. 모든 범죄가 악마와의 계약에 따른 것이라는 서술은 인물의 서사적인 약점으로 보인다. 그러나 이렇게 악을 제시한 이유는 악이 종대와 같은 평범한 인물에 의해 수행된다는 점을 강조하기 위해서이다. 평범한 악이 사회 곳곳에 편재해있다는 것을 떠올릴 때 지구인 이 말한 범죄와 악의 성격은 사회적 층위에서 설명될 수 있다. 악을 실천하는 서사에서 중요한 매개인 총은 권력 관계를 상기시킨다. 총은 상상적 복종을 이끌어 내며, 그것이 절대적이라는 점에서 지배 권력의 구조와 상동적이다. 이와 같은 인식을 통해 지구인 은 범죄소설의 비판의식을 사회적 차원으로 끌어올릴 수 있었다. 총의 속성을 통해권력의 지배와 억압 역시 허상에 근거한 모순된 지배체제라는 점을 드러낸 것이다. 총의 서사 외에도 지구인 에는 다양한 하층민 희생자의 서사가 등장한다. 서커스단의 박씨가 대표적인 인물인데, 그는 서커스라는 소외된 공간 속에서 여성적 지향을 꿈꾸지만 자살로 생을 마감한다. 하층민의 삶은이와 같이 불구의 육체와 역설적 삶의 가치를 실현하고 있다. 뿐만 아니라사회 전체가 ‘막장’과 같은 절망의 공간이며, 감옥 밖이 감옥 안과 다르지않다는 인식을 통해 한국 사회가 얼마나 모순되고 억압적인지를 보여준다. 이에 따라 종세의 일탈과 종대의 범죄는 가치평가 내릴 수 없는 상동인현상임을 결론적으로 드러내게 된다. 범죄자의 극단적인 대결이나 종교로 귀의하는 모습은 한국 사회의 모순에 대응하는 한 양상이 될 것이며, 최인호의 지구인 은 그 가능성을 보여준 셈이다. 지구인 의 범죄소설 유형은 1970년 문학사의 한 주제로 다룰만한 것이다.					0	0	0	0	0	1975-6046		KJD:ART001795306		
J	Iadevito, Paula								Fictions of an Identity: Female Figures and Drifts in the New Korean Cinema								Comparative Korean Studies				21	2			133	167					2013	2013	Fictions constitute narratives that represent an exercise of identity construction, which leads us to the fact of understanding identity as a constant construction in discourse. In this sense, we understand that the experiences of ‘Korean women’ have changed as a product of modernization regarding the senses and meanings that are articulated in filmic fiction territories. With this in mind, first we develop a brief review that defines the imaginary cinematographic of the New Korean Cinema. Then, we display a thematic and analytical lecture of the selected films attending the narrative interests and ways of representing regarding the experiences of women, which are part of a complex social process that tends to pluralism and cultural diversity. We reflect upon ‘women of fiction’ –from a discursive and symbolic conception of the subjects– leading us to the ‘historical woman’, and inviting us to (re)think the constitution of female identity in Korea from the particularity that it assumes in the field of the cinematographic representation.									0	0	0	0	0	1226-2250		KJD:ART001798217		
J	김승희								An Analysis of the Melancholic Subject and Gender Melancholy in the Poems of No Cheon-myeong			노천명 시에 나타난 우울증적 주체와 젠더 멜랑콜리 양상 분석					Comparative Korean Studies				21	3			171	202					2013	2013	The poet No Cheon-myeong has been praised as “the first real female poet” in the history of modern Korean poetry, as a poet of “modernist understatement,” as “the Marie Laurencin of Korea,” but she has also been termed “the poet of lack,” “the poet of solitude,” “the poet of han,” “the poet of longing.”This paper focuses on the “loss”, the loss of "Chose" that dominates the texts of her poems while attempting to consider from a psychoanalytic viewpoint the depressive independence and gender melancholy, the ambiguous gender, the cross-dressing and gender roles, the problem of the bisexual voice, etc. displayed in her poems. In her personal life, No Cheon-myeong experienced the harrowing loss of those closest to her in the formative period prior to becoming an adult, but about those people, rather then grief, she expresses attitudes of melancholy. Having identified herself with those lost individuals, in her poems a melancholic identification appears. The melancholy subject is one who, plunged in melancholy, manifests a rich and undefined identity, caught between the symbolic and the imaginary, and an ambivalent sexual identity, as well contradictory forms of discourse. In particular, people who have lost a person of the opposite gender in the process of establishing their sexual identity often identify themselves with that person (or even a person of the same gender, according to Judith Butler) and gender melancholy arises. In poems such as “Self-portrait,” “Deer,” or “Traveling Players” we have analyzed from a psychoanalytic viewpoint the way the masculine self, the female poet / male speaker, the female poet / male deer, the male transvestite manifest cross-dressing and gender-roles, bisexual voices, gender complexity, multiple sexual identities, gender combinations, ambiguous gender codings etc. As a result, in the male-centered society of the 1930s persistently dominated by feudal patriarchal discourse, her gender melancholy may be said to have expressed the inner division of a female poet living as a blatant symbol of the modernist “new woman,” a strategic device for dreaming of freedom, decentering the conflictual hierarchy of “male / female.” In the gender melancholy appearing in her poems, the word ‘gender’ indicates a gender doubt, not an absolute noun but an ongoing performance, the gender vagueness implying an effective temporary freedom from gender.				노천명 시인은 한국 현대 시사에서 ‘최초의 본격적인 여류시인’, ‘(모더니즘적) 절제의 시인’, ‘한국의 마리 로랑생’ 등 화려한 평가도 받았지만 ‘결핍의 시인’, ‘고독의 시인’, ‘한(恨)의 시인’, ‘동경(憧憬)의 시인’ 등으로 불리워져 왔다. 본고는 노천명 시인의 시 텍스트에 지배적으로 작용하는 ‘상실감’에 주목하면서 그녀의 시가 보여주는 우울증적 주체성과 젠더 멜랑콜리, 모호한 젠더 양상, 복장 전환과 젠더 수행성, 양성적 목소리의 양상 등에 관해 정신분석적 입장에서 고찰해 보고자 한다. 노천명은 개인사적으로 성인(成人)이 되기 전 아버지, 남동생, 어머니 등을 잃었는데 그녀는 시 텍스트 안에 애도보다는 멜랑콜리적 태도를 보이고 있다. 그러나 상실대상은 개인사적 상실 대상에 머무르지 않고 더 큰, 명명불가한, 표상불가능한 대상, 즉 ‘큰 사물’(Chose)이며 상실 대상이 자아 속으로 들어가 나르시시즘과 반(反)나르시시즘, 자기애와 자기비하가 동시에 드러나는 멜랑콜리적 동일시가 시에 나타난다. 멜랑콜리적 주체란 우울에 잠겨 상징계와 상상계 사이에서 부유하며 불명확한 정체성과 모호한 성 정체성을 보이며 모순적인 언술양상을 보이는 주체를 말한다. 그중에서도 특히 성 정체성을 확립하는 과정에서 잃어버린 이성(異性) 부모 대상에 (주디스 버틀러에 의하면 동성의 부모에게도) 자아를 동일시하게 될 때 젠더 멜랑콜리가 드러난다. 시 ｢자화상｣, ｢사슴｣, ｢남사당｣ 등에서 남성적 자아, 여성시인 / 남성 화자, 여성시인 / 숫사슴, 여장남자가 보여주는 복장 도착(倒錯)과 젠더 수행성, 양성적 목소리, 젠더 복잡성과 복수(複數)적 성 주체성, 젠더- 합체, 모호한 젠더 양상 등이 그것이다. 결국 그녀의 젠더 멜랑콜리는 1930년대 봉건적 가부장 담론이 끈질기게 지배하는 남성중심주의 사회에서 모더니스트 ‘신여성’이라는 화려한 기표로서 살아가는 여성 시인의 내면의 분열을 보여주고 ‘남성/여성’이라는 대립의 위계질서를 탈중심화하여 자유를 꿈꾸는 전략적 장치라고 할 수 있다. 그녀 시에 나타나는 젠더 멜랑콜리는 젠더는 절대적 명사가 아니라 수행되는 행위일 수 있다는 젠더 의혹을 보여주고 젠더 흐리기는 젠더로부터의 일시적 자유의 효과를 암시한다.					0	0	0	0	0	1226-2250		KJD:ART001838054		
J	김경순								Victorian Racist and Colonial Logic in Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre			『폭풍의 언덕』과 『제인 에어』에 나타난 빅토리아시대의 인종차별주의와 식민지 논리					COMPARATIVE LITERATURE	비교문학			61				163	188					2013	2013	This study foregrounds the colonial and racial subtexts implicit in narratives of upward mobility that are open only to men. In Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre, Heathcliff and Rochester are characterized as having a desire for accumulation. Both novels expose the unspoken imperialist fantasies that underlie such masculine narratives of class advancement. And having amassed their wealth, both return home to take up a position of mastery. But Rochester and Heathcliff are themselves represented through Victorians images of racial difference. Heathcliff’s actions subsequent to his return can be either, in Mr. Linton’s terms, as a process of stealing, or, in Nelly’s terms, as his having enough money to buy the Heights and the Grange together. Nelly paints the imaginary portrait of Heathcliff as a Chinese prince or Indian prince. She can only project the desires for advancement onto male figures who are free to overcome the limitations of class difference. Similar to the image of the oriental despot, the correlative image of the harem in Jane Eyre conveyed both submission and resistance to dominance. In Jane Eyre, once Jane has been taught to civilize her savage emotions, she can then participate in the scenario of oriental despotism only vicariously through their relationship to Rochester.									0	0	0	0	0	1225-0910		KJD:ART001817620		
J	Joalland, Michael								From Iconoclasm to the Disenchantment of the World - Readings in Milton, Hobbes, and Newton								COMPARATIVE LITERATURE	비교문학			61				411	442					2013	2013	Since Schiller and Chateaubriand, the Romantics have long mourned over the ‘disenchantment of the world’ – the process of secularization of the West interpreted in sociological terms by Max Weber. While the positivist account of the Enlightenment equates the rise of modernity with the advance of science and the subsequent rejection of religious worldviews, a comparative reading of prominent English authors of the seventeenth century reveals a more contrasted picture. Milton, Hobbes, and Newton all rejected medieval animism in the name of iconoclasm – this passionate desire to ‘break images’, whether they be liturgical, monarchical, or celestial. There emerges from the anti-idolatry rhetoric of Puritan literature a resolutely modern view of man and the cosmos based on the will to desacralize all elements of the created order. The counter-reaction of nineteenth century literary and art critics and the subsequent rise of folklore studies reveal the scope of the demystification thus accomplished. It may be premature, however, to claim that modernity is actually ‘disenchanted’ as the propensity to deify real or imaginary beings remains an enduring aspect of the culture.									0	0	0	0	0	1225-0910		KJD:ART001817660		
J	김욱								Does the Natural Law Have the Constitutional Effect?			자연법은 헌법적 효력을 갖는가?					Constitutional Law	헌법학연구			19	2			123	151					2013	2013	The natural law problem of present times is fundamentally different from that of modern times. Modern natural law theorists have no positive natural law, but we have it. It was pure in their imagination, but it is not pure in our real world. Of course, we can not ignore this legal contradiction which reflects the social contradiction. For that reason, we can hardly accept the modern concept of imaginary natural law outside the present positive law. I argue that the natural law have no direct constitutional effect. The Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court are also in the same position. However, on the other hand, I argue that the natural law have the indirect constitutional effect which comes from a logical coherence of the constitutional system. Will there be a future role of the modern natural law? The modern imaginary natural law theorist had dismantled the ideology of medieval times. At the same time, they had justified the positive law of capitalism. In that way, we should sublate the contradiction of the present positive law which reflects the social contradiction. In conclusion, I argue that the present natural law is immanent in the positive law as the anti-positive law. It is reason and conscience which cause creation, change and extinction of the positive law. We should admit the role of the natural law within the historical limits and develop its progressive spirit dialectically.				현대의 우리에게 제기된 자연법 문제와 근대의 자연법론자들에게 제기됐던 그것은 근본적으로 다르다. 그들은 그들이 제정하고자 했던 실정법을 갖지 못했고, 우리는 그들에 의해 자연법의 현현이어야 한다고 주장됐던 바로 그 실정법을 갖고 있다. 그들 상상 속의 ‘자연법=실정법’은 순수하지만 우리 현실 속의 ‘자연법=실정법’은 순수할 수 없다. 우리의 그것은 현실 사회의 모순을 반영하는 내재적 모순을 피할 수 없다. 그런 의미에서, 실정법과 대립ㆍ분화돼 실정법의 외부에만 존재하는 근대의 형이상학적 개념으로서의 상상적 자연법은 그 개념을 받아들이기도 힘들뿐만 아니라 그 자체로 직접 실정헌법상의 효력을 가질 수도 없다는 것이 필자의 입장이다. 우리 대법원이나 헌법재판소의 입장도 직접 효력을 갖는 것으로 판시했다고 볼 수 없다. 하지만 우리 헌법 속에 새겨진 자연법적 흔적이나 우리 헌법의 체계논리적 일관성을 고려하는 법리를 통해서 자연법의 간접적인 효력은 얼마든지 인정할 수 있고, 또 그래야 한다고 본다. 그렇다면 근대의 자연법론은 현대의 법리발전에 앞으로 어떤 역할을 할 수 있을까? 근대의 자연법론이 실정법 너머에 상상적으로 존재하는 자연법을 상정하여 중세의 교리를 무너뜨리고 근대 자본주의 실정법을 정당화하는 기능을 수행했다면, 현대의 자연법은 현 실정법이 반영하고 있는 사회적 모순을 인정하고 그 모순을 타협적으로 지양하는 기능을 수행해야만 한다고 생각한다. 결론적으로, 현대의 자연법은 자본주의 실정법에 내재된 실정법의 대립물이다. 그것은 실정법이 아니면서 동시에 실정법이며, 실정법이면서 동시에 실정법이 아니다. 그것은 실정법의 생성, 변화, 그리고 소멸을 가능케 하는 모순관계 속에서 파악되는 반실정법으로서 인간의 이성이자 양심이다. 그렇게 우리는 근대의 자연법론을 근대 역사의 산물이라는 한계 속에서 인정하되, 현 시대의 보다 정교한 변증법적 법리를 통해 그 진보적 정신을 발전시켜나가야 할 것이다.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-3784		KJD:ART001785190		
J	강계숙								A study on the aspect of the changes of Korean poetry in 1950's ― Focusing the construction and separation of ‘Korean lyricism’.			1950년대 한국시의 변화양상에 대한 고찰- ‘한국적 서정’의 구축과 이반을 중심으로 -					Dongnam Journal of Korean Language ＆ Literature	동남어문논집			1	36			85	118					2013	2013	Kang, Gye-Sook. 2013. A study on the aspect of the changes of Korean poetry in 1950's ― Focusing the construction and separation of ‘Korean lyricism’. Dongnam Journal of Korean Language & Literature 36. This paper aims to study the aspect of the changes of Korean poetry in 1950's through investigating the construction and separation of ‘Korean lyricism’. Structuring ‘Korean lyricism’ is regarded as the biggest change of Korean poetry in 1950's. Seo Jung-Ju and Pak Mok-Weol are representative poets of the time, who are said to structure ‘Korean lyricism’ by means of the rediscovery of traditional nature. But the structurization of ‘Korean lyricism’ is a special product of complex ideologies surrounding inventions of Korean tradition in postwar Korea. This article reviews the meaning of ‘Korean lyricism’ and the special logic which enables traditionalists of the age to conceptualize it. This leads to consider the character of the subjectivization involved their discovery of Korean nature. Reestablishing the suject in Seo and Pak's poetry reflects the collective unconscious of the time. Pak's poetry expresses the desire of subject by imagining harmless nature, in which every negatives of western modernity is completely eliminated. In his poetry, the self is identified with imaginary nature. Through this identification, Pak's poetic self is moralistically justified. Unlike Pak, this immaculate nature become the other in Seo's poetry. Overcoming the limits of imaginary nature, Seo makes nature the outside world of the subject and tries to satisfy its own desire through the intermediation of the other, namely objectified nature. Then, the nature in Seo's poetry turns into the harmless and disinterested other and the spiritualized universals. Identifying with this universals, Seo's poetic self resembles the innocence nature. Thus becoming a oneness with nature, Seo's subject keeps aloof from the world, takes a contemplative view on life, and absolutely affirms world. In this way, ‘Korean lyricism’ is gradually structured. On the other hand Yoo Chee-Hwan and Kim Hyun-Seung's poetry steadily separate from ‘Korean lyricism’ during the 1950's. Yoo's poetry represents nature as the sublime. His nature is the other that overwhelms and overawes the subject. Facing this colossal other, Yoo's subject reflects on himself and wants to be high-souled man as much as the sublime nature. Kim's poetry presents a poetic self as ‘independent one (Der Einzelne)’. This is a new person who is hard to look for in previous Korean poetic literature. Kim's self as a legislator who wants to be the center of things and defines himself by his own set of standards has a marked individuality in comparison to the poetic self in 'Korean lyricism'.

J	Min, Kyungtaek								Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket: Autobiographical Life and Journey of Search for Identity			포우의『낸터킷의 아서 고든 핌의 이야기』: 자전적인 삶과 정체성 탐색의 여행					English & American Cultural Studies	영미문화			13	3			97	118					2013	2013	The aim of this study is to analyze Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket to reveal his autobiographical elements and search for identity. In The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket, Poe created the narrator and hero, Pym, as his fictional alter ego, and reflected his own autobiographical elements to him. Pym's friend Augustus Barnard represents Poe's real brother William Henry Leonard Poe as Augustus is two years older than Pym, the same difference between poe and his elder brother Henry. Also Augustus died at the same date of Henry's death. Poe attempted to demolish or blur the boundary between reality and fiction to search for his own identity. Pym's journey toward the Antarctic symbolizes a journey of search for his own identity. Even though this journey seems to be an adventurous journey, it is imaginary or fictitious rather than real and visible. Throughout the journey, Pym is often confronted with many difficulties and mysteries in the boundary between life and death. Pym's voyage is also an attempt to disintegrate the invisible wall between appearance and reality. In this book, there are many symbolical values and philosophical implications about our life besides Poe's personal search for identity. Therefore, this work is a philosophical exploration about the inexplicable mistery of our life and nature.									0	0	0	0	0	1598-5431		KJD:ART001831132		
J	맹문재								A Study on the Theme of Kim Ku-dong's New Poetics			김규동의『새로운 시론』에 나타난 주제 고찰					EOMUNHAK-The Korean Language and Literature	어문학			119				1	25					2013	2013	This essay is about the theme of Kim, Kyu-Dong’s New Poetics, which was published in 1959. Kim, Gyu-Dong is well known as a modernist poet and critic. He was born in Jongsung, Hamkyungbukdo in 1925 and died in 2011. He has been joined Hubang group in 1950’s, the literal meaning of Hubang is ‘the latter half of the year’. In the first place, I try to examine the conception of modernity in his modern poetry. He insisted on anti-naturalism to criticize the poetics of pure lyric poetry like those of the ‘Chungnokpa(靑鹿派)’. In this attempt, he sought to reconstruct modern poetry to replace pure lyric poetry, which was seemed to reflect contemporary reality. Secondly, this essay I try to look through Kim, Gyu-Dong’s scientific awareness expressed in his modern poetry. He insisted on imaginary aesthetics, consciousness of language, and scientific technique of modern poetry. This kind of his scientific awareness, or the objective and logical attempt, was related to his desire to overcome the trauma of the Korean War in this society. On the base of his attitude was his desire to deny pure lyric poetry. Lastly, in this essay my principle concern is what his historical consciousness is, especially in his modern poems. We can see his painful, confused sense of loss and futility concerning the modern poetry of the 1950’s, in which historical period he was inevitably involved in. In these circumstances, Kim Gyu-Dong’s new poetics aims at constructing new poetry and society by strongly historical consciousness.									0	0	0	0	0	1225-3774		KJD:ART001754523		
J	Yee, Weolyoung								Elasticity and Contradiction in Kim Sameuidang's Life and Literature			김삼의당 유고의 양면성과 실록성					EOMUNYEONGU	어문연구			78				207	232					2013	2013	Sameuidang was a woman writer of upper-class family who made strenuous efforts to restore her collapsed family and put such efforts into her poems and writings together with her inner emotions. Focusing on her authentic history, this study reconstructed the process about her life the sentences in her poems reveal, and then tried to evaluate its connotational meaning through the analysis of contradictive phenomena among her literary works. When she once lived in Namwon, she devoted herself to her husband's success in the "Kwago," the highest-level state exam to recruit ranking officials, which made her life locked in the adhesive shade, as she pursued only her husband's success. For the reason, her poems and writings were mostly related to her husband's behaviors to seek after the 'Kwago.' Though her husband had repeated to enter the mountain and the capitial to prepare and take the exam for 15 years, he finally failed in it, which caused his family to be poverty-stricken and at last move to Jinan. His family settled down in Jinan so as to find a new way out of a life of extreme poverty. In the beginning stage of his life there, her husband showed the attitude to be content amid poverty and take delight in his way of life. Then Sameuidang's concern was expanded to her family members from her husband. But her life in Jinan was not peaceful. She continuously suffered from some terrible misfortunes like both some relatives' deaths and her daughter's death just before her wedding ceremony. She was at the height of sadness and extremely poverty-stricken beyond her control. Her repeated ordeals, however, led her to develop a way of a meditative life and pursue an attitude of intelligent people with good senses. Unexpectedly, she stopped her writings and left her last desperate poem to the world, which was written when she sent her husband to Seoul for the 'Hoesi[會試]' after 'Hyangsi[鄕試]' he passed. It was probably thought that she lost her will to lead her life, since there was not a possibility her husband would pass the 'Kwago' any more unlike her old days when she expected her husband's success in it. Whereas most of her poems put an emphasis on obligations and duties about the relationship between her husband and her during her stay in Namwon, some poems on her inner emotion dealt with 'Kyuwon[閨怨]' towards husband. This is an ironical contradiction her poems obviously have. It is certain that Sameuidang's public persona not only conflicted but also coexisted with her private inner identityThe poems written in her Jinan days belonged to 'Juksasi[卽事詩]' related to her leisure-sentiment. Her 'Kyuwon' poems are due to the counteraction from her strong desire for husband's success in the exam. On the other hand, her 'leisure-emotion poems[閑情詩]' compared a leisured, rustic life with husband to a hermitic life at Arcadia. Her poetic emotion was changed to an idle sentiment from a broken heart. Kim Sameuidang posthumous manuscripts clarifies what 'an discourse to upgrade a woman's social position' really now defines as the one to sublimate her real discouragement into a imaginary satisfaction of aspirations. As literary works her posthumous manuscripts not only show us a life history of the collapsed upper-class family at a country village of 19th century, but also reveal the grief of a woman in Chosun Dynasty, having a direct inclination of authentic chronicles				삼의당은 몰락한 양반집안 여성문인으로 집안을 부흥시키기 위해 분투했던 사실과 내면적 정서를 시문으로 기록했다. 본고는 삼의당 문학이 지니는 이러한 실록적 특성에 주목하고 그녀의 시문이 드러내는 삶의 과정을 재구성한 다음, 모순되는 양상의 문학 현상을 분석하여 그에 내포된 의미를 해석하였다. 남원시절, 남편의 과거시험 합격에 대한 집착은 삼의당의 삶을 관통해, 그 시절 시문은 거의 남편의 과시행보와 관련된다. 남편은 15년 동안 入山과 入京을 거듭하며 과거를 준비하고 시험을 치렀지만 결국 실패했고 생활고에 밀려 진안으로 이주한다. 진안생활 초기에는 농사꾼으로서 안분자족했으며 삼의당의 관심도 남편에서 가족으로 확대된다. 그러나 친족의 喪事를 연이어 겪고 혼사를 코 앞에 둔 딸이 죽는 슬픔을 겪었으며, 궁핍이 극에 달한 생활고에 시달린다. 삼의당은 이처럼 거듭된 시련을 겪으면서 오히려 삶을 관조하는 인생관을 가지며 識者로서의 태도를 견지한다. 그런데 향시에 합격하고 회시를 보기위해 서울로 떠나는 남편을 보내며 쓴 절망적인 시를 마지막으로 절필한다. 남원시절, 남편과의 관계에서 공식적으로 쓴 시는 엄격한 도리와 당위를 말한 반면, 내면적인 자신의 정서를 표현한 시는 閨怨으로 집중해 양면성을 드러낸다. 공식적인 페르소나와 사적인 내면의 얼굴이 갈등하면서 병존했다는 것을 알 수 있다. 진안시절을 지배하는 시는 閑情을 읊은 卽事詩이다. 과거급제에 대한 집착의 견인력에서 풀려나 남편과 함께 하는 이완된 전원생활을 읊은 한정시가 진안시절 초기시를 대변하는 것이다. 김삼의당유고는 현실의 좌절을 상상적인 원망충족으로 승화시킨 ‘여성신분상승담’의 실제를 확인시켜준다. 19세기 향촌의 한 몰락 양반가의 생활사를 그대로 드러냄과 동시에 성취욕 강한 비범한 조선조 여성의 비애를 단적으로 보여주는 실록적인 의미를 지닌다.					0	0	0	0	0	1225-0783		KJD:ART001830738		
J	이영준								The ‘Romantic Myth’ and the ‘Archetypal Desire’ in Myths,Legends and Fairy Tales			신화, 전설, 동화 속에 나타난 ‘낭만적 신화’와 ‘원형적 욕망’					Fairy Tales and Translation	동화와 번역			26				241	265					2013	2013	The ‘Romantic Myth’ - an hero rescuing a princess by slaying a dragon,falling in love with and marrying her - has long historical origins. The ‘Romantic Myth’ appeared in the stories of Perseus in ancient Greek myth and Sigurd in old Germanic myth, influencing the legends of St George, other epics and romances in the medieval age. It was recreated in the fairy tales for the industrial Bourgeoisie after the Renaissance. The ‘Romantic Myth’ was once received as an universal symbol of archetypal love, for it had been repeated through myths, legends, epics, fairy tales, etc. But, this romantic love is not an innate instinct of human beings but a fantasy constructed by culture. All nymphs, goddesses, princesses in myths and legends and beautiful women in fairy tales are such women that seem to promise an absolute fulfillment; they are emerging as the Imaginary ‘object a.’ Thus, the brave princes risks their life to rescue princesses. However, the beautiful women are such erotic images of evoking the desires and illusions of men, in fact, functioning as a sort of lures of concealing the ontological lack of being. As all our desires and illusions are constructed by the others, the ‘Romanic Myth’ has been enforced by the society. This ideology has roles of covering all the contradictions,conflicts and illogicality of the society whose ‘sexual politics’ has justified women’s subordination to men. This essay sets out to analyse how the ‘Romantic Myth’ has institutionalized a universal archetype of love and to examine how it becomes a psychological entity of the mankind.				고대 그리스의 페르세우스(Perseus) 신화에서 볼 수 있듯이 용사가 괴물을 죽이고 공주를 구하고 사랑에 빠지는 ‘낭만적 신화’는 오래된 역사적 기원을 가지고있다. 이 ‘낭만적 신화’는 고대 그리스의 페르세우스와 고대 게르만의 신화, 그리고 중세의 성 게오르기우스의 전설과 중세의 서사시와 로망스를 거쳐서 르네상스이후 부르주아지 사회를 대변하는 동화로 재탄생하게 된다. 이 ‘낭만적 신화‘는 여러 신화, 전설, 민담과 동화들을 통하여 전승됨으로서 마치 인류의 보편적인 사랑의 원형처럼 되어버렸다. 그러나 ‘낭만적 신화’가 표상하는 사랑은 인간의 본성이나 천성이 아니라 문화가 만들어낸 환상이다. ‘낭만적 신화’에서 왕자들은 용을 죽이고 공주를 구하기 위하여 목숨을 무릅쓰고 모험을 떠난다. 신화속의 님프, 요정들, 여신들 그리고 동화 속에 등장하는 잠자는 숲속의미녀, 백설 공주, 라푼젤, 인어공주 등은 남성들의 욕망을 충족시켜 줄 것 같은 절대적 대상이 되는 아름다운 여성들이다. 그러나 이들 이상적인 미녀들은 존재론적인 공허함을 메워주어 남성들의 욕망과 환상을 불러일으키는 에로틱한 이미지일뿐이다. 즉 상상에서만 존재하는 ‘대상 a’일 뿐이다. ‘낭만적 신화’는 원천적으로 부재하며, 인간의 환상과 욕망은 타자들(the Others)에 의하여 구조화 될 뿐이다. 낭만적 사랑은 역사적 경험 속에서 체득된 가부장사회의 결과물이다. 이러한 낭만적 사랑은 현실세계의 모순, 갈등, 비논리성을 억압하고 감추는 이데올로기로서 남성의 여성에 대한 지배를 정당화시키는 ‘성의 정치학’적 내용을 담고 있다. 이 논문은 ‘낭만적 신화’가 어떻게 집단적으로 인간의마음속에 욕망과 환상과 같은 원형적인 심리적 실체를 만들고 형성해왔는지를 분석한다.					0	0	0	0	0	2093-1700		KJD:ART001834922		
J	백영경								Population as a Social Body and the Politics of Knowledge  -Political Imaginations of Sasanggye in the 1960s and the Limits of Liberal Governance-			사회적 몸으로서의 인구와 지식의 정치 －1960년대 『사상계』속의 정치적 상상과 자유주의적 통치의 한계					Feminism and Korean Literature	여성문학연구			29				7	36					2013	2013	Sasanggye often revealed a contradictory position of simultaneously pursuing the liberalist political orientation and the necessity to limit the liberalism. This paper intends to delineate the ways the politics of knowledge in the discourse and practices of population made this seemingly contradictory position possible. The idea of population as a social body was often based on liberalism, but was still able to limit the liberal rights without overtly denying them. Population has been understood as a matter of knowledge, not a subject of political concern. Yet, rather than being an object and stable entity or a politically neutral notion, the concept of population has drawn on a genealogy of concepts with political plentitude, and has changed over time. In this context, this paper aims to analyse what kind of political imagination was behind the practices of population control in the 1960s. Therefore, this paper argues the South Korean state’s management of population crises was not merely as the administration of a demographic problem, but also as a specific way in which the state constructs reality and induces public interventions based on a specific imaginary of the political future. The family planning program was intended to reduce not just the number of childbirths in South Korea, but to limit and eradicate communism in the country. In this sense, the reproductive technologies introduced in this period were essential not only in the family planning program but in the ideological building of the cold war regime of Park Chung Hee as such.				자유주의적인 정치를 강하게 지향하면서도 자유주의를 제약할 필요성을 주장하는 것이 가능할까? 『사상계』속에서 종종 드러나는 이러한 모순적 입장에 대해, 이 논문에서는 이러한 모순적 입장은 인구가 정치의 영역이 아닌 지식의 문제로 받아들여졌기 때문이었음을 밝히고자 한다. 사회적 몸으로서의 인구에 주목한다는 것은, 객관적이고 자명한 문제로서 인구를 바라보는 것을 포기하고 당시 어떤 정치적 상상과 인식 속에서 인구를 제한해야만 경제를 발전시킬 수 있다는 생각이 자리 잡아 갔는지, 거꾸로 인구를 제한하기로 했다는 것은 어떠한 정치적 미래를 기획하는 일이었는지를 보는 것을 의미한다. 이를 이 논문은 통해서 당시 재생산 영역에서의 자유에 대한 의미는 정치적 의미의 자유와 무관할 수 없었음을 보이고자 한다. 당시 인구정책이 여성의 관점에서 이루어지지 않았으며 여성의 몸에 대한 자율권을 보장해주지 못했음을 지적하는 것도 물론 의미 있는 일일 것이나, 근대국가의 인구관리란 그 속성 자체가 개인의 권리를 노골적으로 제한하지 않으면서 제한하는 일이다. 따라서 인구 담론의 위력은 바로 객관적인 지식의 지위를 통해서 남한이라는 정치적 단위를 공고화하는 것에서부터 빈곤의 원인에 대한 특정한 시각을 내면화하는 일, 과거를 해석하고 현재의 삶을 만들어 나가며, 동시에 미래를 기획할 수 있는 방식에 영향을 끼치는 일, 그리고 인간이라는 존재와 윤리적 삶의 방식을 규정하는 일에 이르기까지 다양하면서도 때로는 서로 모순되는 현상들을 가능하게 했다는 데 있었고 할 수 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-4632		KJD:ART001786188		
J	Kim, Suh-Young								A Lacanian Implication Depicted in Ingmar Bergman’s Persona －How It Enacts the Creative Function of the Sinthome－			잉마르 베리만의 <페르조나>에 대한 라캉적 독해－조이스 세미나의 생톰 개념을 중심으로－					Film Studies	영화연구			58				55	85					2013	2013	This paper examines the implication of Jacques Lacan’s Seminar XXIII depicted in Ingmar Bergman’s film, Persona. The latter has been analysed in various ways: one considers it as one of the art films and the other, as a protest against the typical custom of hollywood. These perspectives,however, do not reveal the unique way of the film originating from the director’s life. The film cannot be analysed without looking at the directors own life and his belief in human holiness. It has to be understood as an evidence that proves the unique way of Bergman’s organizing his life. The world created by Bergman’s sinthome is not completely subjected to the Lacanian symbolic order since it does not follow the name/law of the father. The nomination process is carried out not centering around the latter but around the directors own commend. This is exactly what Lacan has examined in Joyce’s writings, or his sinthome. He asserts that Joyce has created a unique world in which the law of the father is substituted by his own way of nomination. It is a world where the writer can live according to his own rules and plans. The sinthome is the very concept that has been offered in order to refer to this singularity which has the structure of ‘mais pas ca’(but not that). The sinthome is the forth knot that connects the remaining orders of the Symbolic, the Imaginary, and the Real in the Borromean knot. This concept has been introduced in the 23rd seminar of Lacan in connection 85김 서 영with his analysis of James Joyce. This paper has demonstrated that one can observe the similar sinthome/writing in Bergman’s life and in his work, and has shown how Bergman’s sinthome has created the basic structure of Persona. There is the element of human holiness at the center of the film and yet it is combined with the most humanly limits, both leading the audiences to witness the birth of the subject. The ultimate aim of this paper has been to represent the possibility of the birth of the subject who can create his/her individual space where the singularity of each person is most cherished and the dream of each subject comes true. This is also the ultimate place where the subject has to be at the end of the analysis in psychoanalytic practice.									0	0	0	0	0	1598-9682		KJD:ART001828682		
J	Tari, Zeinab Ghasemi								American Studies in the Middle East: the Case of Iranian American Studies								Journal of American Studies	미국학 논집			45	1			177	195					2013	2013	The United States strategic, political and economic interests in the Middle East necessitate an academic presence in the region; beside academic significance such centers, often have worked as public diplomacy centers to enhance the contact and collaborations between the American academicians and foreign public in order to introduce and promote American values, culture, policies and interests. Whatever may have been the reasons for supporting establishment of these programs by the US government, it seems that the American imaginary of the United State is challenged and depolarized in the local context of the Middle East. Examination of American Studies program in Iran can provide a unique insight as too see how Iranian students make sense of the US in one of the rare programs in the Middle East that is totally independent from United States’ financial and political support. By using a questionnaire and analyzing the data, the present paper would argue that while American Studies program in Iran is inseparable from its historical reality, context and contact with the US, many Iranian students of American Studies have been able to develop a complex understanding of the United States that transcends the political hostility between the two countries.									0	0	0	0	0	1226-3753		KJD:ART001772430		
J	탁정화; 강현미								A Study on Mise En Abyme in Picture Books			그림책에 나타난 미장아빔에 관한 연구					Journal of Children＇s Literature and Education	어린이문학교육연구			14	2			1	18					2013	2013	The purpose of this study was to examine the roles of mise en abyme in picture books. It's specifically meant to focus on the visual image of mise en abyme to discuss the characteristics of frame texts in picture books. Eight picture books in which the characteristics of mise en abyme were found were selected, and the hermeneutic circle was adopted to have an understanding of its roles. The findings of the study were as follows: Mise en abyme functioned as a mirror to show the psychological state of the main characters, and also served as a medium to cover both an imaginary world and the real world to extend the sphere of story. In addition, it functioned as a route by which the main characters could encounter the writers or readers, and served to stimulate readers to construct a new meaning based on their prior knowledge, experience or expectations and stir up their playfulness and interest. The findings of the study on mise en abyme suggest that readers should construct the meaning of a picture book as a text while they read it, and this study is expected to serve as an opportunity to shed new light on the roles of mise en abyme as a factor to stimulate playfulness and imagination.				본 연구에서는 그림책에 나타난 미장아빔의 역할에 대해 봄으로써 그림책에 나타난 액자식 텍스트에 주목하여 특성을 밝히고자 함에 목적이 있다. 이를 위하여 미장아빔의 특성이 반영된 그림책 8권을 선정하였으며 해석학적 순환과정을 통하여 미장아빔의 역할에 대한 이해를 도모하였다. 연구결과에 의하면, 미장아빔은 주인공의 심리적 상태를 반영하는 거울의 역할, 가상과 현실을 넘나들며 또 다른 이야기 공간으로 확장하는 매개체로서의 역할과 그림책 주인공이 작가나 독자를 만날 수 있는 통로로서의 역할, 독자가 사전 지식과 경험, 기대에 따라 새로운 의미를 추출하고 유희성과 흥미를 자극하는 역할을 하는 것으로 나타났다. 이러한 결과를 통하여, 미장아빔은 그림책을 읽는 과정에서 하나의 텍스트로써 독자가 적극적으로 그림책의 의미를 구성해야하는 필요성을 제공할 뿐만 아니라 유희성과 상상력을 자극하는 요소로서 그림책에 나타난 미장아빔에 대한 역할의 재조명이 이루어지는 계기를 마련할 수 있을 것이다.					0	0	0	0	0	1598-3277		KJD:ART001783604		
J	장성단; LeeJulie								The analysis of “Who pooped on my head?” based on psychoanalytic theory of Lacan			라깡의 정신분석 이론을 통한 그림책 「누가 내머리에 똥쌌어?」 분석					Journal of Children＇s Literature and Education	어린이문학교육연구			14	1			1	18					2013	2013	This study semantically analyzed the picture book, “Who Pooped on My Head?” from a psychological view using the psychoanalytic theory of Lacan. Lacan explained that children’s psychological development is the process of moving from the Imaginary, which is phantasmally combined with mother, to the Symbolic, which father’s law governs. The Symbolic, which father’s law governs, should accept the principle of reality and fulfill desire using language. By going through this process, children become social beings. As a result of analysis of the text, it was discovered that the story of the picture book, “Who Pooped on My head?”, followed the process of psychological development in which the main character moved from the Imaginary to the Symbolic, and suggested the meaning related to sadness, emotional conflict and nervousness which children experience when separated from mother in order to grow up from the Imaginary to the Symbolic. Hence, the picture book, “Who Pooped on My Head?”, played the role of helper in forming normal psychological structure of children by accepting the Other and by reaching reality in good condition.				본 연구는 그림책「누가 내 머리에 똥 쌌어?」를 대상으로 텍스트에 내재된 심층의미와 주인공의 심리발달 과정을 Lacan의 정신분석 이론 중 상상계와 상징계 개념을 중심으로 분석하였다. Lacan은 유아의 심리발달을 어머니와 환상적으로 결합된 상상계에서 아버지의 법이 지배하는 상징계로 향하는 과정으로 설명하였다. 아버지의 법이 지배하는 상징계에서 유아는 현실의 원리를 수용하고 언어를 사용하여 자신의 욕구를 충족시켜야 하며 이러한 과정을 통해 사회적 존재가 되는 것이다. 텍스트 분석의 결과 「누가 내 머리에 똥 쌌어?」는 주인공이 배변과 관련된 사건을 통해 상상계에서 상징계로 진입하는 심리발달 과정을 담고 있었다. 배변규범을 받아들이고, 상징계의 주체가 되는 내용을 담고 있기 때문에 본 연구 텍스트는 유아의 심리발달을 지원하는 조력자로서의 역할이 가능함을 확인하였다.					0	0	0	0	0	1598-3277		KJD:ART001756729		
J	김형란								The Study on Identity of the Chinese Mime  - in Terms of Comparison with Western Pantomime			중국 마임의 정체성 고찰 - 비교문학적 관점에서 -					JOURNAL OF CHINESE HUMANITIES	중국인문과학			53				351	373					2013	2013	This study was designed to investigate identity of the chinese mime compared with western pantomime. Pantomime can be defined as the dumb show that deliver the story to audience with only action, and the mime defined physical expression coming into action in the stage everywhere as well as dumb show. Therefore, the mime has broader meaning than pantomime and chinese mime is appropriate expression to indicate the Zuo(做) and Da(打) of chinese display that dose not include dumb show. One of the reason why China dose not have independent dumb show at present is thought as their thinking process seeking comprehensiveness not dispersion or analysis and successive developmental process of display to Xiaoxi(小戱) and Daxi(大戱). I also studied that historically the dumb like Yajaju(啞雜劇) had been displayed in era of Song dynasty and direction using dumb show technique and art form remain into various kinds of presnet chinese play. The identity of chinese mime was first studied through animations for searching it in terms of direction form of dumb show. The its direction forms can be divided to lyric, action, and comic styles. All plays that did not use all dialogues or was composed of motion mostly, were studied and classified. Through this study, the differences between chinese mime and western pantomime as focusing on direction of dumb show, and the identity of chinese mime with various aspect can be summarized as follows. Chinese mime focused on dancing itself, used the music as an essential component, expressed imaginary motion using object-free action, was consisted on the basis of Xieyi(寫意) concept like poetic literature, displayed on the stage with a formal motion having the significance and standard as a sign, and used facial make-up, Lianpu(臉譜), which leads actors to concentrate other physical expressiveness instead of covered facial expression. On the other hand, western pantomime focused on the story description, excluded music in the play basically, expressed fantastic substance using object-free action, was composed on the basis of the realism in narrative literature, reenacted real motion, and used the facial and mouth expression as an important factor to render dramatic contents.									0	0	0	0	0	1225-3499		KJD:ART001762458		
J	최경란								Family, Maternity and Violence in Titus Andronicus:The Connected Meanings			타이터스 앤드로니커스 에 나타난가족과 모성 그리고 폭력: 그 연계된 의미					Journal of Classic and English Renaissance Literature	고전 르네상스 영문학			22	2			107	139					2013	2013	This paper attempts to disclose a certain dramatic features germane to Titus Andronicus, an early Shakespearean tragedy, regarded as controversial for excess of violence and cruelty. The dramatic features are placed under scrutiny in terms of the amplified meanings of the family and maternity looming in the play in relation to seemingly unbound varieties of violence. The paper begins with an overview of the concepts of family and maternity understood as a historical as much as a literary device. The argument follows the line of feminist dialogue, pointing to varied ways of relating gender to rhetoric, biology, and other symbolic topics, as well as to social beliefs and institutions. The main argument addresses the familial norms, nexus and maternal entanglements protruded in the play. These issues are examined in close reference to the patriarchal values and ideologies entertained in Rome. The paper finds the fossilized piety of the Andronici responsible for the initial spread of violence in the play. The paper also argues that the lustful and wicked Tamora, as commonly interpreted by critics, is credited to embodying the triad layers of maternity: instinctive, power-laden, and one enclosed in the Lacanian Imaginary World. The paper takes note of Tamora wielding maternal power, albeit perverted, to reciprocate the evil done by Titus. It also takes note of Lavinia, the very symbol of female virtues in Rome, portrayed unfavorably in this discourse for her insensitivity to maternity and to human compassion. The paper concludes that even though Tamora stays outside the realm of normative femininity in Rome, she prevails as a figure bolstering up the construct of family and maternity as a theatrical element considered crucial to interpreting the violence in this play.									0	0	0	0	0	1226-8798		KJD:ART001831448		
J	장은영								Lacan's Subject and Desire through the Analysis of the Animation <Rango>			애니메이션 <랭고>를 통해 본 라캉의 주체와 욕망					Journal of Digital Design	디지털디자인학연구			13	4			189	200					2013	2013	In modern society, necessity on self-reflection has increased because of the absence and obstacle of humanity. And necessity on self-reflection has extend a serious discourse of the ego and subject in various fields including an animation. This study researched on process to be formed of the subject based on the realization of the hero, Rango’s desire in the animation <Rango>. This study used the theory of Jacques Lacan’s the subject. Jacques Lacan insisted process of reborn from unconscious-being to subjective-being as using Imaginary, Symbolic and Real. This study, as using three philosophical concepts, analyzed utterance scenes of characters and internal psychology scenes in <Rango> which were divided 14 scenes. And this study researched that some meaning evolution of <Rango>’s story based on result of analysis as using Jacques Lacan’s terms. The results of this study were as followings:At first, Rango’s desire is a kind of desire to be recognized another person consistently as appearing in Imaginary, Symbolic. This Rango’s desire may reflect on modern humans’ unconsciousness those who have wanted to be recognized another person but have lived by themselves without communication one another. This animation shows us process which is to be formed the real subject by hero’s self-reflection who have some desire. Secondly, <Rango> is a Western genre ostensibly but <Rango> appears nature’s power and importance of telling, water in content. That does not emphasize Western’s typical personalities, Western pioneering spirit etc. In thematic aspects but emphasize a restoration of waterway(nature), it is namely, a restoration of life. And that appears people don’t want acquisition of power and wealth unconditionally.				현대사회에서 점차 확산되고 있는 인간성의 결핍과 장애에서 비롯된 자아성찰에 대한 필요성은 애니메이션을 포함한 다양한 분야에서 자아와 주체에 대한 진지한 담론으로 확대되고 있다. 본 연구에서는 애니메이션 <랭고>를 대상으로 주인공 랭고가 욕망의 실현을 통해 주체가 형성되어가는 과정을 라캉의 주체이론을 중심으로 살펴보았다. 라캉은 하나의 무의식적인 존재가 주체적인 의식을 가진 인간으로 재탄생하는 과정을 상상계, 상징계, 실재계를 통하여 주장하였다. 이러한 이론을 토대로 <랭고>에서 등장인물들의 발화가 이루어지는 장면과 비언어적이지만 내면 심리가 드러나는 장면을 14개로 나누어 분석을 실시하였다. 그리고 라캉의 언어로 분석한 결과가 스토리 전개에서 어떠한 의미를 구성하는지 연구하였다. 분석된 본 연구의 특징을 정리하면 다음과 같다. 첫째, 상상계와 상징계에서 나타나는 랭고의 욕망은 일관되게 타인으로부터 인정받고자 하는 욕망이다. 이러한 랭고의 욕망은 타인과 소통의 관계를 형성하지 않은 채 소외되어 살면서 타자의 인정을 원하는 현대인의 무의식을 반영한다고 볼 수 있다. 애니메이션은 이러한 욕망을 가진 주인공이 자아성찰을 통해 진정한 주체가 되어가는 과정을 보여준다. 둘째, 외형적으로는 서부극의 형태를 보이고 있지만 내용적으로는 물이라는 기표를 통하여 자연의 힘과 중요성을 보여주는 것이라 하겠다. 이는 주제의 측면에서 기존의 서부극이 가지고 있는 주인공의 전형적인 성격, 서부의 개척 정신에 대한 동경 등을 부각시킨 것이 아니라 사람들이 진정으로 원하는 것은 무조건적인 개척을 통한 권력과 물질의 획득이 아닌 물길(자연)의 복원이 곧 삶의 회복이라는 의미를 내포하고 있음을 보여준다.					0	0	0	0	0	1598-2319		KJD:ART001812906		
J	강계숙								A study on the sense of guilty in Kim Jong-Sam's later poetry			김종삼의 후기 시 다시읽기―‘죄의식’의 정동과 심리적 구조를 중심으로―					Journal of East Aisan Cultures	동아시아문화연구			55				151	181					2013	2013	The sense of guilty in Kim Jong-Sam’s later poetry is closely connected with reestablishing the subject. This paper aims to consider the historical meanings of self-representation in Kim's poetry by analyzing generational unconscious and family romance within its. For example, Kim's poetic subject identifies himself ‘a blind father’ as a symbol of incompetent father. ‘A blind father’ is the only self-image as a existent father in Kim’s poetry. But ironically, he wants none of it. He cannot help contradicting himself. Owing to this self-contradiction, the foreclosure of the Name-of-the-Father is caused and structured throughout Kim's poetry. For this lack of the Name-of-the-Father, the suppletions that is a substitute or a stand-in for what is missing at the level of symbolic is attempted. A world without adult men, the imaginary identification with maternal Jesus, and a fantasy of artist-community are some various forms of symbolic suppletion. But as time passes, the sense of guilty is much more stronger, and need for self-punishment and death drive are dominant over all the others in his poetry. This paper explains that the complex psychology of him originates from the unconscious desires of becoming-father. His feeling of guilt is a unconscious sign that he desires to become ‘a new father’. But the desire of becoming-father is thoroughly suppressed in Kim’s. To become ‘a new father’ may be to a primal father, neither a existent incompetent father nor a symbolic father, called the Name-of-the-Father. But a primal father is also a obscene father, according to Freud. For this reason, Kim’s poetic subject relinquishs his desire, but rather it deepens his sense of guilty. But, by reason of nursing this desire, the superego sentences the ego to a severe punishment, and the ego must die to expiate his own crime. This is why Kim’s feeling of guilt turns is gradually converted into death drive. In later poetry, Kim’s subject is identified with a man who wants his own death. To him, living a life is jouissance, a kind of deal in which pleasure and pain are presented as single packet. It means that the pleasure cannot be obtained without paying the price of suffering. In later poetry, Kim fails to become the subject of desire and his subjectivization is concluded in the subject of jouissance.				김종삼의 후기 시에 두드러지는 죄의식의 정동은 주체의 자기정립 과정과 밀접히 연관되어 있다. 본고는 텍스트에 내재된 가족 로망스적 상상과 세대적 무의식을 분석함으로써 김종삼 시에 나타나는 정체성 표상의 시대적 의미를 살핀다. 무능한 아버지의 상징인 ‘장님 아비’는 주체가 스스로를 아버지로서 (무)의식할 때의 자기표상에 속한다. 그러나 김종삼의 시적 주체는 이를 용인하고 수락하지 않는 자기모순 속에 있다. 이러한 모순의 심화는 ‘아버지의－이름’의 폐제를 시 전체에 걸쳐 구조화한다. ‘성년－남성’이 부재하는 세계, 모성적 예수와의 동일시, ‘예술가－공동체’라는 환상의 구축은 부권적 은유의 결여에서 비롯된 것으로 폐제된 것의 자리를 채우는 상징적 보충에 해당한다. 하지만 전(前)－외디푸스적 관계로의 퇴행은 죄의식의 심화를 해결하지 못하며, 후기로 갈수록 자기파괴적인 징벌 욕구와 강렬한 죽음충동이 시 전체를 지배하게 된다. 본고는 이러한 심리 구조가 ‘장님 아비’가 아닌, 그것의 역상(逆像)인 새로운 ‘아버지’가 되고자 하는 무의식적 욕망이 싹튼 데서 비롯한다고 보았다. 김종삼 시의 죄의식은 아버지－되기의 욕망이 작동하는 것에 대한 무의식적 신호라 할 수 있다. 이 신호에 의해 주체는 새로운 아버지가 되고자 하는 욕망을 포기하지만, 욕망의 포기는 죄의식을 오히려 강화한다. 김종삼에게서 아버지-되기의 욕망은 철저히 억압된다. 새로운 아버지－되기란 현존하는 아버지도, 부도덕한 상징적 아버지도 아닌, 그들 모두를 몰아내는 원초적 아버지가 되는 일일 수 있기 때문이다. 그러나 그러한 욕망을 품고 있다는 것에 대해 초자아의 판결은 훨씬 가혹해진다. 자아는 혹독한 처벌을 받아야하며, 자기의 죽음을 징벌의 형식으로 받아들여야 한다. 죄의식은 죽음충동으로 점차 심화된다. 후기로 갈수록 김종삼은 자신을 죽음을 원하는 자로 정체화한다. 이러한 주체에게 삶은 스스로를 벌하는 충동과 바닥모를 죄의식의 심연이 한묶음으로 주어지는 것과 같다. 삶이란 쾌락을 택하면 죽음을 원하는 자기파괴가 뒤따르고, 그러한 고통을 덜고자 죽음의 쾌락을 택하면 삶의 상실이라는 괴로움이 잇따르는 것은 주이상스 그 자체라 할 수 있다. 후기에 이르러 김종삼의 시적 주체는 주이상스의 주체로 현현한다. 한국시에 이러한 주체의 형상이 드물다는 것은 김종삼의 시를 고유한 것으로 만든다. 죽음을 수용하는 한에서만 주체는 윤리적 주체가 될 수 있기 때문이다. 하지만 욕망의 주체-되기가 포기되는 상황은 한 개인의 욕망과 심성, 무의식의 체계와 마음의 구조, 삶의 태도에 대한 문화적 억압의 정도를 시사한다. 욕망의 추구가 자유의 문제와 직결되는 한, 욕망을 포기한 죄의식의 주체는 그가 속한 세계의 ‘자유의 부재’를 상기시킨다. 그런 점에서 김종삼의 후기 시는 욕망의 추구를 구속하고 그것의 포기를 강제하는 현실이, 그 같은 사회적 억압과 불합리성이 전후 한국적 모더니티가 구축해온 역사의 ‘이면’이었다는 사실을 환기한다.					0	0	0	0	0	1738-933X		KJD:ART001822739		
J	Won, Chul								Saussure’s Linguistic Theory and Dignaga’s Apoha Theory			소쉬르의 언어이론과 디그나가의 아포하론					journal of eastern-asia buddhism and culture	동아시아불교문화			13				233	261					2013	2013	The apoha theory, propounded by Dignaga, is an approach about human conceptual cognition and its indispensible means, language. The theory examines how a word refers to its object and what is the nature of the relation between the two. It is through the ‘exclusion of others’(apoha) by words that we can separate objects that belongs to the same group from those which do not, and construct a concept on the basis of the objects in the same group. Likewise, Ferdinand de Saussure, the forefather of the structuralism, maintains that a linguistic sign can be itself and have its own referent only by the ‘difference’ with other signs in the linguistic system to which it belongs. Saussure's theory rejects the ‘nomenclaturism’ which considers language to be the list of names of things supposedly pre-existing, and regards language as an autonomical system isolated from the world. Both Dignaga and Saussure do not admit that language conveys the transcendental truth. There are no external and original things that makes words come into being and endow them with their meanings. These ideas throw questions on our beliefs and common senses which are given from external authorities and taken for granted. By foregrounding the linguistic systems and conditions, both Dignaga's apoha theory and Saussure' linguistic theory lead us to re-examine the fictional and imaginary nature of our language and concept.				아포하론은 인식의 대상이 되는 존재의 범주 중 특히 ‘보편자’의 실재성을 부정하는데서 오는 인식론상의 문제를 해결하기 위한 이론이다. 이를 위해 디그나가는 보편자를 지시한다고 가정되는 언어의 허구성을 드러내고, 그로 인해 보편자의 비실재성 또한 밝히고자 했던 것이다. 낱말은 ‘타자의 배제’에 의해, 즉 그것의 지시대상으로 구성될 수 있는 것 외의 것들을 모두 배제함으로써, 그 내용을 부정적으로 구성한다. 따라서 언어는 항구적이고 불변하는 보편자가 아니라 타자의 배제를 지시하며, 의미의 보증자로서의 보편자의 존재는 부정된다. 소쉬르는 ‘명명법’(nomenclaturism)적 언어관을 극복해야 할 대상으로 보았다. 언어는 세계와 분리된 자립적인 체계이며 자체의 의미작용의 질서를 가지는 독립적 질서이다. 기호의 의미는 언어 체계 내에서 각각의 기표들과 기의들의 ‘차이’를 통해 구성된다. 언어 단위들 중 어떤 것도 체계에 앞서 존재하지 않는다. 언어에 의미를 보증하는 외부대상이나 기원 같은 것은 없다. 언어는 미리 존재하는 사물들에 붙여진 이름들의 목록이 아니며, 오히려 언어의 분절 체계가 인식의 대상을 구성한다. 소쉬르와 디그나가는 언어를 현상적 표현과 내용의 기저에 놓인 심층적인 체계로 설명한다. 지시대상은 미리 주어진 낱말이 기능하는 방식에 의해 구성되는 것이다. 이 기능의 방식과 그 내용을 결정하는 체계는 우리의 의식에 직접적으로 드러나지는 않지만, 언어를 통한 인식과 사고를 가능하게 하는 기본 조건이 된다. 그리고 그것은 언어공동체의 사회․역사․문화적 환경에 따라 다르게 나타난다. 이들의 이와 같은 구조적 관점은 고정적이고 불변인 초월적 진리가 언어를 매개로 해서 우리에게 전달된다는, 상식적 언어관에 토대를 둔, 실재론적 가정과 믿음을 거부하는 유용한 수단이 된다.					0	0	0	0	0	1976-0604		KJD:ART001759473		
J	Ha, Mikyung								The Concept and Origin of Attainment of Buddhahood with This Very Body(卽身成佛)			즉신성불 사상과 그 사상적 연원					journal of eastern-asia buddhism and culture	동아시아불교문화			16				113	147					2013	2013	In esoteric Buddhism as well, the theory for attaining Buddhahood, namely the ultimate stage Buddhism pursues, can be investigated from various perspectives. This kind of theory is typified differently as to where to place the perfect stagein this world or in an imaginary, ideal, future world. The former type is considered the gate of attaining Buddhahood by self power(自力成道門), which is represented by Seon(Zen) school; the latter is the gate of pure land by other power(他力成道門), which focuses on chanting the Buddha name. Viewed in this way, esoteric Buddhism can not be said to belong to the type of the pure land school even though it makes its motto “With one’s body as transmitted from the parents(父母所生身), reaching the state of great enlightenment through quick realization(速證大覺位), achieve Buddhahood with this very body(卽身成佛).” In addition, the esoteric teachings do not take the method of steady advancement by step-by-step process as in the case of the exoteric teachings(顯敎). Rather, the theory of Buddhahood in the esoteric teachings can be viewed as that through the non-duality of self and other power(自他不二力) in that it stresses the Three Powers, namely one’s power of merits(功德力), Buddha’s power of grace(加持力) and power of Dharma-realm(法界力). Esoteric Buddhism says it is a faithful successor of Mahayana Buddhism. Nevertheless, it is difficult to define esoteric Buddhism as the teachings for attaining Buddhahood by self power(自力成佛敎) as in the case of the practical philosophy and the capacity theory described in the Huayan(華嚴) and Faxiang(法相) schools. Subject matters of the esoteric teachings, whether they be of the Aryan or non-Aryan lineage, constitute what was latent in the ancient Indian culture. It can be safely said that the thought of esoteric teachings is the result of Mahayana Buddhism which actively embraced, sublimated, stabilized, and refined the ancient Indian culture. In that sense, the theory of attaining Buddhahood in the esoteric teachings is evolving in a unique manner.				불교에서 추구하는 최고의 경지인 성불론은 밀교에 있어서도 여러 가지 각도에서 그 특색을 살펴볼 수가 있다. 성불론은 성불이라고 하는 완성의 경지를 현실의 세계에 둘 것인가 혹은 상상의 이상세계, 내지는 미래의 세계에 둘 것인가로 유형화할 수 있다. 전자는 선종의 수행을 대표로 꼽을 수 있는 자력성도문, 후자는 염불을 위주로 하는 타력정토문으로 볼 수 있다. 이러한 분류에서 보면 밀교는 부모소생신(父母所生身), 속증대각위(速證大覺位), 즉신성불(卽身成佛)을 모토로 하고 있으면서도 정토교의 범주에는 속한다고 말할 수 없다. 또한 현교처럼 단계를 밟아 꾸준히 올라가는 방법만을 취하지도 않는다. 밀교의 성불론은 자기의 공덕력, 여래의 가지력, 법계력의 3력에 의한 성불을 강조하는 점에서 자타불이의 힘에 의한 가르침으로 볼 수 있다. 밀교는 스스로 대승불교의 충실한 후계자라고 말한다. 그렇다 해서 화엄이나 법상에서 말하는 실천철학, 근기론에 따르는 자력의 성불교(成佛敎)라고 위치지우기는 곤란하다. 밀교의 소재는 아리야계와 비아리야계를 불문하고 고대 인도문화에 잠재되어 있었던 부분이다. 밀교사상은 대승불교에서 고대 인도문화를 적극적으로 포섭하고 승화시키며 내실을 강구하면서 순화시키고 있는 것이라고 보아도 좋을 것이다. 그런 점에서 밀교의 성불론은 독특하게 전개되고 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	1976-0604		KJD:ART001838891		
J	황아영								Sung Hyun’s speaking and means by ‘Buhyuja’ in The story of Buhyuja and Discussion of Buhyuja			‘浮休子’를 내세운 成俔의 말하기와 그 의미 ｢浮休子傳｣과 『浮休子談論』을 중심으로 					Journal of Korean Classical Chinese Literature	漢文古典硏究			27	1			7	35					2013	2013	This article scopes out a fictional charater – Buhyuja’s speaking and means in The story of Buhyuja and Discussion of Buhyuja written by Sung Hyun (1439-1504). Sung Hyun described Buhyuja, an ideal type of human character, with Buhyuja’s personality and enjoyment in an autobiographical essay The story of Buhyuja. Meanwhile, Discussion of Buhyuja composed of three type of fascicles: ‘Graceful Words’, ‘Foolish Words’ and ‘Complementary Words’. In Discussion of Buhyuja, fictional characters had appeared in each section so that contemporary issues had been described with indirect narrations, which purposed to escape punishments derived from direct and straightforward speaking. In accordance with direct speaking from imaginary persona and bitter satire on society in The story of Buhyuja and Discussion of Buhyuja, Sung Hyun had sincere remonstrance and satire on a king. Sung Hyun seemed to conform a demand – ‘The king is the Heaven’. However rather, Sung Hyun actually emphasized a king is a representative of the Heaven only for the public. In addition, Sung Hyun looked like to follow an assertion – ‘Personal talent and ability are obtainable with learning’, though Sung Hyun, in fact, highlighted one’s natural ability inborn characterized as well as scarcely changed. On the other hand, Sung Hyun had stated a middle coursed view of political opinions without single-side-on stance. Eventually, Sung Hyun applied various speaking on a fictional charater – Buhyuja. Then, Sung Hyun directly expressed meaning of his political opinions and self-esteem against contemporary social situations.				본고는 성현이 부휴자라는 가상의 인물을 내세워 말하고 있는 ｢浮休子傳｣과 『浮休子談論』을 중심으로 부휴자의 말하기와 그 의미를 살펴보고자 하였다. 성현은 자탁전의 형식을 가진 ｢부휴자전｣에서 부휴자의 성품과 즐거움을 이야기하며 자신이 추구하는 이상적 인간상을 그려내었다. 그리고 寓言의 형식을 갖춘 『부휴자담론』은 이야기 방식에 따라 ｢雅言｣, ｢寓言｣, ｢補言｣ 3가지 양식으로 나뉘어져 있는데 각 양식마다 부휴자와 허구 인물, 역사인물을 등장시킴으로써 현실문제에 대한 직설적인 화법을 피하여 자신의 주장을 내세우고 있다. 성현이 자신을 드러내어 직접 말하지 않고 부휴자라는 인물을 내세워 말하고자 한 것이 무엇인지를 살펴보면, 첫째로, 임금에 대한 강한 勸戒와 諷刺임을 알 수 있다. 부휴자를 통해 이전의 훈구관각파가 주장한 ‘임금은 하늘이다’라는 의견을 따르는 듯하지만, 그 이면에는 ‘임금은 다만 백성을 위한 하늘의 대리자임’을 강조하고 있으며 이렇게 간접화법을 통해 말함으로써 자신을 드러내어 말하는 데에 따르는 화를 면하고자 하였다. 그리고 성현은 표면적으로 ‘재주와 능력은 배워서 얻을 수 있는 것이다’라고 말하는 듯하지만 결국 ‘능력과 재주는 타고나는 것이며 쉽게 변할 수 없는 것’이라고 주장하며 자신의 타고난 재능과 능력을 더욱 강조하고 있다. 그러면서 훈구관각파와 도학 사림파 사이에서 어느 한쪽의 편도 아닌 중간자적 입장의 정치적 견해를 밝히고 있음을 볼 수 있다. 성현은 당시의 시대적 상황으로 인해 직접 말하기 어려운 자신의 정치적 견해와 강한 자긍심을 간접적으로라도 드러내기 위하여 부휴자라는 인물을 통해 주장을 펼친 것이라 볼 수 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	1975-521X		KJD:ART001834238

J	임재욱								The Meaning of Cheongsanbyeolgok(靑山別曲) from the Synthetic Point of View- Regarding it’s composed with four different songs -			四歌 合成의 관점에서 본 <青山別曲>의 의미					Journal of Korean Literature	국문학연구			28				175	200					2013	2013	Cheongsanbyeolgok(靑山別曲) which is one of the songs of Goryeo(高麗) dynasty is composed of eight stanzas. And the eight stanzas can be divided into four pairs, and two stanzas of every pairs correspond structurally with each other. In this respect, the stanzas and phrases of Cheongsanbyeolgok(靑山別曲) can be interpreted according to the counterpart. The results of interpretation based on this point of view are as follows. The first and sixth stanza represent the ideal or imaginary space, the second and fifth express the grief in the real world and the cause of it, the third and seventh represent the impossible situation or fantasy world, and the fourth and eighth express the loneliness and the cause of it. About the meanings of the phrases and stanzas I could confirm such facts as follows. That is to say, the grief expressed in second stanza originated not from the loneliness arising out of the life in deep mountains but from the disagreement between the world and the self expressed in fifth stanza. And the third and seventh stanza can be interpreted smoothly leaving the words and expressions as it is, if we think that they represent some impossible situations in common. In addition the loneliness in the fourth stanza originated from the relationships between men and women, in other words the situation that the poetic narrator lost her lover to another woman.				전체 8개 연으로 이루어진 <청산별곡>에는 구조적으로 대응되는 연들의 짝이 존재한다. 대응되는 연들을 둘씩 묶으면 8개의 연은 다시 4개의 단락으로 나뉜다. 본고는 이 점에 착안하여 이 작품이 둘씩으로 묶이는 네 편의 서로 다른 노래가 합성되어 이루어졌을 가능성이 있다고 보고, 짝이 되는 연끼리의 대응양상에 초점을 맞추어 <청산별곡>의 의미를 해석해 보았다. 이러한 관점에서 살펴본 결과, 이 작품의 제1연과 제6연은 공히 이상적 혹은 가상의 공간을 노래하고 있고, 제2연과 제5연은 현실적 비애와 그 근원 노래하고 있으며, 제3연과 제7연은 환시과 환청을 통해 불가능한 상황 혹은 환상의 세계를 노래하고 있고, 제4연과 제8연은 현실적 고독과 그 근원을 노래하고 있는 것으로 해석된다. 구절 및 연의 의미와 관련하여 본고는 다음과 같은 점 등을 확인할 수 있었다. 즉 제2연에 표현된 ‘시름’은 제1연에 표현된 산 속 생활에서의 고독에서 비롯된 것이 아니라 제5연에 표현된 ‘세계와 자아의 불일치’에서 비롯된 것으로 볼 수 있다. 또 제3연의 ‘잉무든 장글란 가지고 믈 아래 가던 새’와 제7연의 ‘사미 대예 올아셔 금을 혀거를’은, 그것들이 공히 불가능한 상황을 노래하고 있는 것으로 본다면, 어구와 표현을 있는 그대로 두고도 자연스럽게 해석할 수 있다. 아울러 제4연의 고독은 제8연에 표현된 남녀관계, 곧 제3자에게 연인을 빼앗긴 상황에서 비롯된 것으로 볼 수 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	1598-2076		KJD:ART001823152		
J	Yun, He Shin								Mythic Subject’s Gaze Which Bore Ancient Korean Mother Goddess and Its Expression			어머니신을 낳은 신화적 주체의 시선과 표현 방식					Journal of Korean Oral Literature	구비문학연구			37				37	72					2013	2013	Myths have been transmitted without determined authorship in Korea. Mythic subjects who created myths in ancient Korea have not been known. However, by the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan’s theory, information of mythic subjects could be drawn from narratives’ expression and characters of myth,because expressions hold mythic subject’s desire and gaze. In the level of psychoanalysis, mother is the Other who interprets a baby’s desire in its signals. As an infant desires mother, mythic subjects desired mother. In myth, the desire was expressed as ‘mother goddess’. Mother goddess as Other projects the gazes of mythic subjects. At first, Korean mythic subject depicted a goddess as mother nor a spouse nor a maid. Later, goddess expressed as spouse and a maid. Korean mother goddesses are mainly two types: goddess nature and female giant. Goddess nature is a deity who resides in natural beings like mountains,water, a bear and an imaginary animal like a combination of chicken and dragon. The other type is female giants. She was so big she could be laid her body between mountains and island. Mother was regarded as a mountain, at the same time mother regarded as a divine being, a national ancestor of ancient kingdom. All these four different beings treated as ‘one being’ naturally and harmoniously. In this way, mythic signified was formed by layers of metaphor in ancient Korea. The mythic way of combining all four beings is by metaphor and imagination. For example, two different beings, that is, a mother and a mountain were merged into a being by metaphor. Motherhood of mother was transferred into mountain and then, mountain gained the new signified, a mother. Once metaphor is formed, mountain was regarded as a mother. Like this way, mother became a divine being, a national ancestor as well as a mountain. Nationwide found female giant’s narrative has several types. Among the types,the depiction of huge female body is understood as a reflecting mythic world view because mythic subjects have more interests in the features of being itself comparatively. Meanwhile the other types of narrative seem afar from mythic era. The productive motherhood was imagined into enormous volume by the mythic gaze. The motherhood is so great enough to be a giant. Even though the giant does not bear children, her body represented itself a signifier of productivity,creativity as like mother’s body. Therefore, her productivity could be easily connected to female giants’ creative works, such as formulation of mountain, water stream in the other female giant myth. In light of the relationship with amain leading character, the characteristics of mother goddesses are various in Korean ancient myth. A type of self-sufficient goddess is self-regulating. She has no relation with spouse even when she bore children. A type of complementary goddess, aiding son’s mythic task. A goddess with lack asking phallus in Lacanian sense has not her own law or order. The gaze of mythic subjects of ancient Korea, corresponds to child’s gaze who happened to see mother as Other in the developmental times of the Oedipus complex. The Korean mother goddesses can be analyzed in accordance with the gaze as below. Ungnyeo[웅녀, 熊女] of proto-Chosun projects mythic subjects’ gaze at the third time of the Oedipus complex with symbolic father’s intervention. Ungnyeo prayed for her pregnancy to male god Hwanung[환웅, 桓雄]. Yuhwa [유화, 柳花] of Koguryeo and Junggyeon-moju[정견모주, 正見母主] of Kaya project mythic subject’s gaze at the second time of Oedipus complex. The mother and child’s harmonious relationship is dramatized in the events of narrative while the male spouse gods, Haemosu[해모수, 解慕漱] and Ibiga[이비가, 夷毗訶] are situated behind the events. They are imaginary father at this time. Seosul-seongmo[서술성모, 西述聖母] of Silla projects mythic subjects’s gaze at the first time of Oedipus complex. The goddess bore child without spouse. Seosul-seongmo was an embodied figure of self-sufficient mother by child. Female giants is self-sufficient, independent. She regulates her by her own law. This goddess has no lack which finds her Lacanian phallus from the other god or any other relations. Goddess projects the gaze of mythic subjects. Korean mythic subjects experienced the times of Oedipus complex and bore Korean goddess with mythic imagination, mythic metaphor. The gaze moved from mother to spouse and the third person maid in Korean ancient myths. It means mythic subject’s psychological desires and gaze on mother moved and changed.				현재 고대신화의 제작자, 제작층에 대한 정보는 거의 없다시피 하나 정신분석학 이론을원용하여 일부 도출할 수 있다. 자크 라캉의 시선(gaze)이론은 물리적인 바라봄(seeing)과욕망이 결부된 시선(gaze)을 구분한다. 또 주체가 자신의 욕망으로부터 대타자(Other)를 어떻게 보고 있는지를 분석하여 신화의 인물을 바라보는 제작자의 심리적 위치를 이해할 수있다. 고대의 어머니신화는 신화적 주체가 대타자인 어머니를 상호주체적 시선으로 이해하여은유와 상상의 방식으로 구성한 서사이다. 한 예로, 어머니와 산은 각기 다른 존재이지만신화적 주체의 시선에 의해 은유적으로 통합되었다. 나아가 어머니, 자연물, 신, 국가적 조상은 은유적 방식을 통해 하나의 존재로 간주되었다. 여기서 신화 특유의 기의가, 기표들의클러스터(cluster)를 통해서 형성되고 있음을 보게 된다. 한편 여성거인 신화 중 육체성에 초점이 맞추어진 신화는 외견상 출산을 하지 않은 여신이지만 특유의, 풍요로움은 신화적 모성과 동질적이므로 어머니신으로 분류 가능하다. 다른 여성거인 신화 유형보다 신화적 세계관에 가까운 것으로 보인다. 이 유형은 ‘경이로운,큰 육체’만을 강조하는데 이렇게 존재 자체의 특징에 대한 관심만으로 서사가 구성되는 것은 신화의 보편적인 특징이다. 거대한 육체는 상대적으로 왜소한 자의 시선에서 바라본 결과로 인간이 모성을 크기로 상상했음을 뜻한다. 어머니신은 자기 완결적인, 완벽한 어머니, 주인공과 상보적 관계에 있는 어머니, 배우자의 팰러스를 희구하는 ‘결핍된 어머니’ 등으로 표현되었다. 이 어머니신들은 각각 신화적주체의 시선을 투사한다. 이 시선은 오이디푸스 콤플렉스(Oedipus complex)의 단계에서 어머니를 바라보는 유아의 시선에 대응한다. 라캉주의 맥락에서 웅녀는 오이디푸스 콤플렉스의 셋째 단계에 위치한 유아 시선의 국면을 보여주며 유화[주몽의 어머니로 여겨졌던 부여신도 해당됨]와 정견모주는 母子의 二者 관계적 시선을, 서술성모는 첫째 단계 유아의 시선을 보여준다.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-019X		KJD:ART001834782		
J	이수진								A Study of Art Therapy based on Jacques Lacan’s Psychoanalytic Theory			라깡의 정신분석이론에 근거한 미술치료 메커니즘					Journal of Lacan & Contemporary Psychoanalysis	라깡과 현대정신분석			15	2			49	80					2013	2013	This study will shed a light on the mechanism of art therapy based on Jacques Lacan's psychoanalytic theory. Art therapy is to explain the 3 constituents of art therapy: the subject, the art as object a, and the analyst. Art therapy is to describe the 2 therapeutic processes and the 4 fundamental concepts. The first therapeutic process has the 2 fundamental concepts of the projection and the repetition as the dual relation of the imaginary of the subject and the art. The second therapeutic process has the 2 fundamental concepts of the desire and the transference as the triple relation of the symbolic of the subject, the art and the analyst. After the 2 therapeutic processes, the end of art therapy is identification with symptom. Art therapy enables the subject's self-discovery in the relation among the imaginary, the symbolic and the real, and makes the process of subjectivation more visualized by verifying the mechanism, which makes the subject identify the object a with the art in the first therapeutic process, the object a with the analyst in the second therapeutic process, and the object a with the symptom(sinthome) in the end of art therapy. Art therapy based on Jacques Lacan's psychoanalytic theory encourages further efforts for continuous study later on, becoming an art therapy as the ethics on the border between personal psychology and social psychology.				본 연구는 자끄 라깡의 정신분석이론에 근거하여 미술치료 메커니즘을 해명함으로써 미술치료의 의미를 밝히는 것을 목적으로 한다. 미술치료는 분석주체·대상 a로서의 예술·분석가의 세 형성체로 이루어지며, 세 형성체의 유기적 작용에 따라 두 가지 치료 과정과 네 가지 근본 개념을 구명한다. 제1의 치료 과정은 분석주체와 예술의 상상적 2자 관계로서 투사와 반복을 근본 개념으로 한다. 제2의 치료 과정은 분석주체와 예술과 분석가의 상징적 3자 관계로서 전이와 욕망을 근본 개념으로 한다. 두 가지 치료 과정 이후 도달하는 미술치료의 종결(분석의 끝)은 분석주체의 증상과의 동일화이다. 미술치료는 제1의 치료 과정에서는 분석주체의 대상 a를 예술과, 제2의 치료 과정에서는 대상 a를 분석가와, 분석의 끝에서는 대상 a를 증상과 동일화하는 메커니즘을 해명한다. 이로써 미술치료는 상상계·상징계·실재의 연관성 속에서 분석주체의 자기 발견을 가능하게 하고, 다른 분석 경험에 비해 주체화 과정을 보다 가시화하는 의의를 밝힌다. 나아가 라깡의 정신분석이론에 근거한 미술치료는 개인 심리학과 사회 심리학의 경계에서 윤리로서의 미술치료가 됨으로써 추후 지속된 연구 노력을 촉구한다.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-666X		KJD:ART001827928		
J	서유석								A Study on KimInhyang-jeon: The New Meaning of Absence of Mourning, Revenge of Ghost with a Grudge and Revival			｢김인향전｣에 나타나는 애도작업(Travail du deuil)의 두 가지 방향: 애도 부재로 인한 자살과 해원을 통한 재생의 새로운 의미					Journal of Lacan & Contemporary Psychoanalysis	라깡과 현대정신분석			15	1			121	145					2013	2013	KimInhyang-jeon is an early-time stepmother-related novel, and was recognized as an imitator of JanghwaHongryeon-jeon. However, the stepmother's prosecution of the main character Kim In-hyang without real reasons, Inhyang's personality inclinations, obstacles to marriage, and love motif, and the combination of these factors have drawn attention. This paper, based on the theory of Freud and Lacan, examines the cause of Inhyang's suicide, and the meaning of her relief of ghost with a grudge and revival. Freud distinguished between sorrow and Melancholy, and Lacan claimed that, only through the process of mourning, sorrow can be properly overcome. Thus, Inhyang's death, namely, suicide, was caused presumably by her Melancholy over her mother's death because she was not able to overcome her sorrow through mourning. Her Melancholy leads Inhyang not to recognize her stepmother as a member of her family, and is seen as the prime cause of the whole story. As described in the latter part of the novel, Inhyang's ghost with a grudge appearance, relief of her revengeful mind and her revival offer a new meaning to the novel. This is because Inhyang's suicide due to her personal Melancholy alone cannot properly explain her ghost with a grudge appearance and revival. As Lacan pointed out, it is possible to say that ghosts appear from a hole that is made when the living does not fully satisfy the dead's desire, relieving aggrievement and revival described in the text are resposes to 'imaginary family' that contemporary readers want. Namely, the readers of KimInhyang-jeon look straight at contradictions of 'symbolic family' that the ideology of patriarchal system requires, and they try to settle them by mourning for Inhyang's death.				｢김인향전｣은 그간 초기 계모형 소설의 하나로 ｢장화홍련전｣의 아류로 인식되었으나, 특별한 이유가 없는 계모의 박해와 아울러 주인공 인향의 인격적 성향, 그리고 혼사 장애와 애정 모티프의 결합과 같은 특징으로 주목받아온 작품이다. 본고는 프로이트와 라깡의 이론을 바탕으로 주인공 인향의 자살의 원인과 아울러 작품 후반부에 등장하는 해원과 재생의 의미를 다시금 탐색해보고 있다. 프로이트가 슬픔과 멜랑꼴리의 특징을 구분한 이후, 라캉은 애도의 과정을 통해서만 슬픔이 적절히 극복될 수 있음을 밝힌 바 있다. 따라서 인향의 자살은 어머니의 죽음으로 인한 슬픔을 애도를 통해 극복해내지 못한 멜랑꼴리에 의한 것으로 판단된다. 어머니의 죽음을 애도하지 못한 인향의 우울은 계모를 한 가족의 구성원으로 인정하지 못하고 있으며, 이는 서사 전체 갈등의 주요한 원인이 되고 있다. 작품 후반부에 드러나는 인향 원혼의 등장과 해원 및 재생은 다른 의미를 찾아볼 수 있다. 개인적인 우울로 인한 인향의 자살만을 가지고 인향 원혼의 등장과 재생을 설명하기 어렵기 때문이다. 라깡의 지적처럼 유령이란 죽은 자의 욕망을 산자가 다 채워주지 못했을 때 생기는 구멍에서 등장하는 것으로 볼 수 있다면, 작품이 가지고 있는 해원과 재생은 당대 향유층이 원하는 ‘상상적 가족’에 반응한 결과이다. 즉 ｢김인향전｣의 향유층은 가부장제 이데올로기가 호명하는 ‘상징적 가족’의 모순을 직시하고, 이를 인향 죽음의 애도작업으로 풀어내고 있다고 볼 수 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-666X		KJD:ART001796360		
J	Paek, Hwankie								A Revolution as a Fable: a Case of Baraka’s The Slave			우화로서의 혁명: 바라카의 The Slave의 경우					Journal of Modern English Drama	현대영미드라마			26	3			89	111					2013	2013	For Baraka, a political activist, drama is the means of achieving the unity of political action and literary art, which has always been crucial to him. The Slave is a fable which deals with an imaginary revolution war through which Baraka is willing to give a lesson to his black people. The revolution is less important as a literal meaning than it is significant as an allegorical background for the conflicts within Walker. The physical violence and the emotional confrontation in the play are actually a projection of Walker’s subjective experience as a split personality. The importance of exploiting a revolution as a plot and a dramatic form was twofold for Baraka; his plays threatened the white oppressor while entering into the discovery of his identity. Characters in the play are the archetype of some ideologies. Walker, a commander of the revolutionary army, is the representative of Black Nationalism or the Black Arts Movement while Grace and Easley are typical of assimilation and liberalism respectively. On any account Baraka thinks that liberalism and assimilation to the American culture are vices to black people who try to establish their own identity. Baraka insists that through crushing all American cultural matrix the black people will emancipate themselves from them, and obtain a true identity.									0	0	0	0	0	1226-3397		KJD:ART001834218		
J	정광숙								Julia Cho’s Desert Trilogy: A Topography of the Lost								Journal of Modern English Drama	현대영미드라마			26	3			291	311					2013	2013	Growing up in the American Southwest as a second generation Korean American, Julia Cho knows the desert and the lives of Asian Americans. She sees the metaphorical analogy between the landscape of the American desert and Asian American life in the United States. Cho focuses on the sense of loss, dislocation, and failure the characters experience and presents their arid life in her desert trilogyThe Architecture of Loss, BFE, and Durango. This paper discusses how Cho configures the background of the trilogy, the desert, to explore the emotional and psychological landscape of the Asian American characters. The subject matters she deals with in these plays like missing child, plastic surgery, or homosexuality, however, transcend their geographical and racial specificity and are the common issues in contemporary America. The spaces of the plays are devastated by memories of personal and familial losses, and the characters go through the process of gaining a clearer understanding of their loss to live with it. Cho fathoms the depth of loss Asian Americans experience in the America by including such elements as rain and water, inexplicable episodes, and imaginary figures in her desert trilogy.									0	0	0	0	0	1226-3397		KJD:ART001834555		
J	이지영								Spinoza's solution for the outcasting problem: Cultivating virtue of community, reinforcement of moral education ― A comment on PARK Sam-yeli's "Spinoza's cure in the Wangdda as a social pathology"			왕따 현상에 대한 스피노자적 대응: 공동체의 덕성 함양, 인성 교육의 강화 ― 박삼열의 ｢사회병리현상으로서의 왕따와 스피노자적 치료｣에 대하여					Journal of the Daedong Philosophical Association	대동철학			63				63	79					2013	2013	This Thesis is a comment on PARK Sam-yeli's 'Spinoza's cure in the Wangdda as a social pathology'. PARK surveys various social science researches. According to PARK's final results of survey, only the empathic ability improvement programs could have positive influence on people related to outcasting problem. The empathic ability improvement programs apply the virtual situation in which "people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones" to people. In this conditions, people could acquire the self-reflection ability as a result of experiencing the harassed scapegoat's pain. And social science researches find that the persons who are relevant to this outcasting problem have strong egocentric personality too. These final findings say that the outcasting problem is connected to ethology. PARK connects this very point to spinoza's human theory. I basically agree with PARK's analysis at this point. PARK insists that 'way of the wise' should be solution for this problem. But unlike PARK, I aim at demonstrating that cultivating virtue of community is Spinoza's solution for the outcasting problem as social pathological phenomena in this thesis. According to Spinoza, Human's actual essence is conatus. Conatus is "striving to preserve in its being". This power appears in the pursuit of more perfection. People of the immature mind understand inadequately his own self and others. He has self-concentrated understanding methods. The outcasting problem is expressed in this inadequate understanding methods. Spinoza have two solutions. for this problem. First solution is becoming rational man, that is, high-intelligent man as Spinoza's meaning. Rational man is generous to other people always. Another one is reinforcing moral education. Spinoza takes a positive view of imaginary truth, such as morals, public rules and universal religions. The public are acted rationally and generously upon these morals, religions and public rules like high intelligent man. Because the outcasting phenomena is mostly the problem of the young, immature students, therefore reinforcing humanity education and moral education is good solution of this phenomena for Spinoza.				본 논문은 박삼열의 ｢사회병리현상으로서의 왕따와 스피노자적 치료｣에 대한 논평 논문이다. 박삼열은 해당 논문에서 이 문제에 대한 폭 넓은 사회 과학적 연구 성과를 검토한다. 사회 과학적 연구에 따르면 왕따 문제에 관련된 이들에게 긍정적 영향을 미친 중재 방법은 서로의 처지를 바꿔 생각해볼 수 있게 해주는 ‘공감 능력’ 향상 프로그램 등에 한정된다. 왕따를 당하는 사람 입장에 서서 그 고통을 체험해보게끔 하는 것이다. 그리고 사회 과학 연구는 왕따 현상에 관련된 이들이 나르시스즘적인 성향, 즉 강한 자기 중심적 성향을 보인다는 결과를 내어놓는다. 왕따 현상에 대한 다양한 대처법에도 불구하고 긍정적인 결과가 도출되는 대처법은 역지사지의 공감 능력 향상 프로그램 등에 한정되고, 왕따 현상에 관련된 이들이 일반적으로 강한 자기 중심적 성향을 보인다는 것은 왕따 현상이 ‘인성’ 문제와 깊은 관련을 맺는다는 결론을 내리게 해준다. 박삼열은 이 지점을 스피노자의 인간론과 연결시킨다. 그리고 스피노자적 의미의 ‘현자의 길’을 사회 병리 현상으로서의 왕따 문제의 치료법으로 제시한다. 그러나 본 논문은 큰 틀에서 박삼열의 분석에 동의하면서도 사회 병리 현상으로서의 왕따 문제에 대한 스피노자적 치료법이 현자의 길을 가는 것보다는 규범, 도덕 교육의 강화에 있다는 것을 보이고자 한다. 스피노자에 따르면, 인간의 본질은 코나투스다. 이 코나투스는 ‘자기 보존과 그 역량의 강화’를 꾀하는 힘이다. 미성숙한 인간은 자기 중심적인 방식으로 이러한 코나투스를 표현한다. 그는 왜곡된 방식으로 자기 자신과 타인을 이해하고, 부적합한 방식으로 자기 실존 역량 즉 코나투스의 강화를 꾀하는 것이다. 왕따 현상은 바로 코나투스가 미성숙하게 표현된 결과라고 할 수 있다. 이에 대한 해법은 두 가지가 있다. 이성적인 인간, 현자가 되어 자기 자신과 세계를 적합하게 인식하고 그에 따라 행위하는 것이다. 이러한 현자는 타인에게 언제나 관용을 베풀기 위해 노력한다. 또 다른 하나는 도덕, 규범 교육을 강화하는 것이다. 스피노자는 이성지를 표현하는 상상지의 역할에 대해 긍정적이었다. 그리고 이성지를 표현하는 상상지의 대표적 예가 바로 도덕과 규범이다. 대중은 규범과 도덕에 의해서 현자와 마찬가지로, 관대하고 적합하게 타인을 대할 수 있게 된다. 왕따 현상이 어린 학생들 사이에서 주로 일어나는 문제인 만큼, 왕따 현상에 대한 스피노자적 해법은 바로 이 규범, 도덕 교육의 강화에 있을 것이다.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-0750		KJD:ART001789946		
J	남진숙								The space and meaning of island in the Korean modern poetry			한국 현대시에 나타난 섬의 공간 및 그 의미					Journal of the Island Culture	『도서문화』			42				181	203					2013	2013	This is a research paper studying on the meaning and symbolism of island in the Korean modern poetry. The significant portion of the study is the texts describing the image and motif of the island. The island is very close linkage of human life and various meanings and symbols are included in it. So, to understand the spatiality of island is very useful to study the human values ​​and philosophical thinking. This paper examined the features how poets recognized and shaped the space of island. First, the island is the experience space that forms a very intimate relationship with human life by showing human livelihoods. At this time, the experience space that is not a psychological or fantasy but a geographically isolated island, is the symbol of their livelihoods. Second, the island for land people is the unfamiliar area to heal mental and physical fatigue, at the same time it is a rest place. Also, for those who live by the sea it is a space that gives emotional stability and hope as a space imaging and reproducing memories. Third, the island is concerned with the perception by exposing the imaginary space through two kinds entities that exist or not, or by dominating perception as aesthetic space. At this time, the island is located as a space revealing the fundamental human emotions such as loneliness, solitude, reflection of life and so on. Fourth, the island is located as the natural space in harmony with the beauty and mystery of the natural ecological space, the unity of man and nature. Over, the island geographically always present, but in poet's recognition it has various meanings and dimensional spaces. The recognition and metaphor on island as ocean literature will broaden the base for the creation of literature and research. Ocean literature can be referred to as fishing villages, islands, the human experience of the sea, as well as the things around the axis of human life including the unique life experience. Therefore, to study the island, including the direct and indirect experience what was done in island, the formation of the poetic perception and worldview through island is to broaden the ocean literature, this paper is also in line at that point.				본고는 한국 현대시에 나타난 섬의 공간이 갖는 의미와 상징성을 연구한 논문이다. 섬을 주요 소재로, 혹은 주요 모티프 및 이미지로 삼은 텍스트를 그 연구 대상으로 삼았다. 섬은 인간의 삶과 매우 밀접한 연계성을 지니며, 기표와 다양한 기의를 내포하고 있다. 그러므로 섬과 그 공간성을 파악하는 것은 인간의 삶과 가치관 및 철학적 사유를 연구하는데 매우 유용하다. 이에 본고는 섬이라는 공간에 대해 시인이 어떻게 인식하고 체험하여 형상화하였는지 그 특징을 살펴보았다. 첫째, 섬은 인간 삶의 터전을 온전히 보여주면서 인간 삶과 매우 내밀한 관계를 형성하는 체험공간이다. 이 때 체험공간은 심리적이거나 공상에 그치는 것이 아니라, 지리적으로 고립되어 실재하는 섬으로서, 섬 사람들의 삶의 터전 그 자체를 상징한다. 둘째, 섬은 육지 사람들에게는 정신적․육체적 피로와 상처를 치유하는 낯선 공간이면서 휴식의 공간으로 존재한다. 또 바닷가 사람들에게는 추억을 상상하고 그 추억을 재생산하는 공간으로서 정서적 안정과 희망을 주는 공간이다. 셋째, 섬은 현실에 존재하는 실재의 섬과 존재하지 않는 비실재의 섬, 두 가지를 통해 상상의 공간으로 추상화 되어 형상화되거나, 심미적인 공간으로서 인식을 지배하고, 인식에 관계한다. 이 때 섬은 인간의 근원적 정서인 외로움, 고독, 쓸쓸함, 삶의 반성 등을 드러내는 공간으로 자리한다. 넷째, 섬은 천연의 자연생태공간으로 아름다움과 신비성, 인간과 자연의 일체성을 이루며 생명력을 이어가는 천연 공간으로 자리한다. 이상, 섬은 지리적으로 언제나 그 자리에 존재하지만, 시인의 인식 속에는 입체적인 공간으로 작용하며 다양한 가치와 의미를 지닌다. 해양문학의 공간으로서 섬을 인식하고, 은유하는 것은 문학의 창작과 연구의 저변을 넓히는 일이기도 하다. 해양문학은 어촌과 섬은 물론, 인간이 바다를 체험하고, 그 주변 것들이 인간의 삶을 중심축으로 하여 독특한 삶의 체험을 아우르는 것을 말한다. 그러므로 섬을 포함한 그 섬에서의 직간접적인 체험이 어떻게 이루어졌고, 섬을 통한 시적 인식과 세계관이 어떻게 형성되었는가 하는 점을 연구하는 것은 해양문학의 연구를 더욱 깊이 있게 하는 것이고, 이 논문도 그런 점에서 맥을 같이한다.					0	0	0	0	0	1598-4893		KJD:ART001834349

J	김용하								A study on the political narrative of the Buddhist Anarchism and the Divination in Shin-chaeho's ｢The Fierce Strife between Two Dragons｣			신채호의 ｢龍과 龍의 大激戰｣에 나타난 불교 무정부주의와 점복 신앙의 정치적 서사 양상에 대한 연구					Journal of The Society of Korean Language and Literature	어문논집			69				299	326					2013	2013	The purpose of the paper is to investigate the political aspects of the Buddhist Anarchism and the divination of grassroots people in the ｢The Fierce Strife between Two Dragons｣(｢龍과 龍의 大激戰｣). The Shin- chaeho’s thought of the latter part is to be the Buddhist Anarchism. He lived as the monk in the early 1920s. After the chinese asylum, he used to be absorbed in the Buddhism scriptures - The Awakening of Faith in Mahayana and Vrimalakirti Sutra - . He combined the Buddhism with the anarchism. He appreciated the limit of the modern thinking. He saw through the violence of the modern thinking. The modern thinking concealed the contraction of the capitalism and colonialism. So, he wished to deconstruct the structure of the modern thinking. He regarded the grassroots people as the subject of the revolution. The grassroots people had to the destructive power. They destroyed the authority of the modern thinking. As mentioned, Shin-chaeho wanted to combined the Buddhism with the grassroots people’s thinking. But practically, he found the project heavy going because of the realistic difficulty. So, he sought to write the fictional writing. The fictional writing provided the possibility for the imaginary community. These thoughts were reflected in the ｢The Fierce Strife between Two Dragons｣. The narrative characters in the ｢The Fierce Strife between Two Dragons｣were as follows. First, it reflected to eradicate the ill- fated relationship and a misdeed of the pre heaven. It wanted to destroy the structure of pre heaven, including the modern epoch. The King of kings(上帝) and the dragon(미르) are the symbol of the violence of the pre heaven. They used violence against grassroots people. Second, it expressed the sunyada(空)of the niratman-subject(無我-主體). the niratman-subject indicated that the association of the grassroots people will be formed as the subversive subject. Because the niratman-subject regarded the modern as the sunyada(空), it overcomed the violence of the modern. the structure of pre heaven, including the modern epoch is not fixed but changeable according to the grassroots people’ degree of self-awarenes about the modern contradiction. Third, the niratman-subject used counterviolence for the vimoksa(解脫). They didn’t admit the modern violence, engaged in aimed struggle for the post heaven. They disaffirmed the repression of pre heaven. Fourth, The eschatology in the ｢The Fierce Strife between Two Dragons｣was Divination and the curse of dragon. The grassroots people depended on the divination in their daily life. As we have seen, ｢The Fierce Strife between Two Dragons｣ demonstrated that the relation between the Buddhist Anarchism and the eschatology of the divination of grassroots people.				신채호는 중국 망명 이후 근대 식민주의의 폭력에 현실적으로 대응할 방식을 고민하던 중 무정부주의를 수용했다. 그는 이론과 실천을 주체적으로 도모했다. 그는 무정부주의를 주체적 관점에서 재해석하는 과정을 거쳐 이론과 실천의 구조를 확보했다. 그가 중국 망명 시기에 불교 서적을 탐독하고 승려 생활을 했다는 점을 고려하면, 그의 무정부주의에 대한 시각에는 불교적 사유가 반영되었다고 추정할 수 있다. 아울러 그는 지식인과 영웅 중심적 세계관을 벗어나 기층 민중이 혁명의 주체로 존재할 수 있다는 점을 인식하면서 민중적 세계관을 수용했다. 그는 근대 사회의 억압을 파괴하기 위해 민중의 자각한 의식이 필요하다고 생각했다. 이러한 조건을 서사적으로 반영하고 있는 작품이 ｢龍과 龍의 大激戰｣이다. ｢龍과 龍의 大激戰｣은 불교 무정부주의와 점복 신앙의 혁명적 조건을 서사적으로 활용하고 있다. 민중은 사적 이익을 추구하지 않고 공적 연대를 형성하면서 혁명 주체로 부각한다. 즉, 민중은 무아 주체로서 상호 연대의 가능성을 도모하기 때문에 연대 가능성을 확대할 수 있다. 민중의 무아 주체에 대한 자각에는 공(空)에 대한 사유가 반영되어 있다. 미리와 드래곤은 무아 주체의 공(空)에 대한 자각 여부에 대한 상징이다. 민중이 선천 시대의 폭력을 무자각한 상황에서는 미리가 등장한다면, 폭력적 해탈을 거쳐 후천 시대의 유토피아를 마련하려는 의식이 갖춰진다면 드래곤이 나타난다. 그러므로 미리와 드래곤은 민중이 현실 세계의 모순을 자각하는지 여부에 따라 다른 상징체계가 형성한다는 점을 말해준다. 아울러 신채호는 민중적 세계관을 재인식했다. 이른바 그는 기층 민중의 점복 신앙을 서사적으로 활용하면서 혁명 주체를 견고하게 만들었다. 민중은 후천 시대를 맞이하기 위해 드래곤으로 표상되는 저주의 주문을 확산한다. 특히 ｢龍과 龍의 大激戰｣은 신점을 통해 천국의 종말을 예언하는 장면을 서사적으로 배치해 후천 시대의 시공간을 확보할 수 있다는 점을 보여준다. ｢龍과 龍의 大激戰｣은 신채호의 후기 사상을 압축적으로 보여준다. 그는 무정부주의를 주체적으로 수용하면서 불교와의 이념적 융합을 모색했고, 민중의 혁명적 조건을 무조건 승인하지 않으면서 민중의 점복 신앙을 전면적으로 수용하면서 후천 시대의 혁명적 기운을 존속하고자 했다. ｢龍과 龍의 大激戰｣은 불교 무정부주의와 점복 신앙을 통해 근대 사회의 억압적 토대를 파괴하고 민중적 세계를 건설하기 위한 정치적 서사의 일환이었다는 점을 알 수 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	1226-6388		KJD:ART001840621

J	Lee, Yunhee								Place-mediated Imagination and Narration: An Analysis of Documentary Flim, Saroyanland			장소를 매개로 한 상상력과 내레이션 - 다큐멘터리 영화 <Saroyanland>를 중심으로					korean association for visual culture	영상문화			23				117	151					2013	2013	This paper looks into the issue of the actual world and the fictional world by applying semiotic analysis to a documentary film, Saroyanland. The film is about a well-known American novelist, William Saroyan. In particular, the film traces his journey to his family’s hometown, Bitlis in Turkey, which Saroyan made in 1964 for the first time and the last time. The director of the film poses the question of what is the boundary between fact and fiction, by portraying two worlds, possible and actual, while welding the two. The director skillfully combines the two worlds, Saroyan’s imaginary world is presented in the literary space by means of voice-over and the actual world represented by an actor playing Saroyan who actually made the trip to Bitlis. The documentary film, unlike a life story of Saroyan in third-person narration, uses first-person narration delivering Saroyan’s words through a carbon-copy voice actor. This results in producing three interacting pairs: image and word, actual world and possible world and, eventually, Saroyan and the viewer. This paper explores the particular point of how the effect of the film makes the viewer use imagination in order to discover the meaning which is presented to the viewer in general. Thus, two different types of place are analyzed in Peirce’s semiotic framework. Accordingly, place as an index and place as an icon are analyzed as to how the two types of place are connected with the idea of creative imagination. A storyworld is a well-captured expression for describing a mental space separate from an actual world. It has a special function as a psychological tool for higher mental processes. When a possible world which resides in the actual mind is realized in an actual world, the two worlds change through dialogical interaction, discovering new meaning in life in a dialectical way. This is the way of interaction between fact and fiction in the form of narrational activity.				본 논문은 다큐멘터리 영화의 기호학적 분석을 통해 실제세계와 허구세계의 관계를 논한다. 분석에서 다루어지는 영화는 미국의 작가, 윌리엄 사로얀이 1964년에 가족의 고향인 비틀리스를 방문한 사실에 기초한다. 감독은 영화에서 가능성의 세계와 실제의 세계를 잘 혼합하여 그려낸다. 즉 사실과 허구의 관계를 실제적 장소의 이미지를 표현하면서 동시에 사로얀 문학을 보이스오버로 내레이션하는 과정에서 이미지와 말의 두 모드를 통해 장소성의 개념을 영화이미지로 그려낸다. 특히 현실과 허구의 경계를 허물어 버린 것이 본 다큐멘터리 영화가 기존의 다큐멘터리 형식과 차별성을 갖는 지점이며 예술형식을 취하게 되는 기점이 된다. 영화는 두 명의 사로얀, 즉 문학공간에서의 보이스오버와 실제적 공간에서의 작가이미지가 대화적인 관계에서 소통하며, 이미지와 말, 실제의 세계와 가능성의 세계, 그리고 감독과 관람자를 매개한다. 본 논문은 이러한 예술적 다큐멘터리 형식이 생산자 뿐 아니라 수용자를 포함하여 모두에게 기호학적 모델링이 됨을 밝히며 내레이션 활동을 통한 예술 형식의 유의미성을 강조한다. 이를 위해 퍼스의 기호학적 관점을 토대로, 도상으로서의 장소와 지표로서의 장소가 상호독립적인 대화적 관계로 재현되는 장소성의 개념을 설명하고, 이러한 장소를 매개로 한 상상력과 내러티브를 매개로 한 상상력에 대해 논한다. 결론적으로 장소와 내러티브를 매개로 한 창조적인 상상력은 서술적 활동(narrational activity)을 통해 제 삼의 의미를 발견하게 한다. 본 논문은 이러한 서술적 활동이 미래를 서술하는 과정으로서 생산자와 수용자의 내러티브 정체성을 구축하는 기제가 됨을 분석을 통해 보인다.					0	0	0	0	0	1598-1088		KJD:ART001838421		
J	이태준								A Study on ‘Main melody’ literary policy and ‘Anti-corruption novel’ of China			중국의 ‘주선율(主旋律)’ 문예정책과 ‘반부패 소설’ 연구					Korean Corruption Studies Review	한국부패학회보			18	3			157	175					2013	2013	Since the launch of China’s Reform and Opening-up policies in 1980, the corruption problem became a pivotal issue that gained the focus of the contemporary public and was therefore reflected in the literary works of various artists. These literatures, called the anti-corruption novels, mainly accused the rulers who utilized their superior positions to pursue private profits in the spread of Mammonism. In addition, the novels criticized the hideous nature of bureaucracy, the corrupt daily lives of the leaders, and the irrationality of exchange of finance and authority. Moreover, government employees’ nefarious inners and personalities are illustrated in the creations. In other words, the writers initialized to examine the abuse of political power and illegal activities committed by public officers that led to political corruption. Obviously, the anti-corruption literature was not established by the spontaneity or genuine conviction of the writers. This is attributed by the fact that the Chinese society severely controlled the media and the freedom of press. The Chinese government was soon threatened by the fact that corruption already turned into a crucial problem which could affect the fatal of the nation and lead to the destruction of the social system. Thus, it began to take extensive measures, such as rectifying laws and policies and more importantly, manipulating literature, in order to prevent corruption. Anti-corruption literature thereby entered the “main melody” literature, representing the mainstream of beliefs and values. Main melody literature aimed to reveal the major trend, fundamental regulation, and mainstream thought of social and historical development of the era. After the 1990s, the political literature played a significant role at satisfying the requirement of the governing class inside the convention set by the ideology of the rulers. Unlike the suppressing mechanism applied before the Reform and Opening-up polices, the mechanism in which the producers of these literary creations worked was encouraging. Hence, the anti-corruption literary was obliged to give priority to describe the ideology of authorities rather than criticizing the corrupt activities committed in reality. Ignoring the fact that the actual corruption emerged from the inner part of the organization that owned and practiced public power and forcing the readers to discover uprightness in communalists, anti-corruption novels sought to cringe to the government power instead of serving the public or Socialism. Owing to the appearance of heroes and solving problems, the endings of the novels are always trenchant. However, the fabrication due to authors’ feeble ideal convictions and the government’s literary policy concealed and distorted the root of corruption. The imaginary settlements of problems were completed in disguise and eventually the authors served as pawns that justify the mainstream ideology under the commands of the nation.				1980년대 이후 중국에서 개혁개방 정책이 실시된 이래, 부정부패 문제는 민중들의 관심이 집중된 시대적 화제가 되었으며 일부 문인들의 창작에 반영되어 이른바 ‘반부패 소설’이 탄생하게 되었다. 반부패 소설은, 개혁개방 이후 갈수록 중국 사회 곳곳을 뒤덮고 있는 배금주의의 만연 속에 권력자들이 우월한 지위를 이용하여 사적인 이익을 추구하는 권력의 부패를 고발한 작품들이 주류를 이루고 있다. 관료사회의 생태와 관리의 생활, 금전과 권력 교환의 부조리를 고발하였고, 관리들의 내면세계와 인성을 묘사해내었다. 즉, 공직자들이 권력을 운용하는 과정 속에서 저지르는 권력남용과 불법행위가 경제 부패로 이어지며 정치권력의 사유화가 작풍의 부패로 이어지는 현상을 파헤치기 시작한 것이다. 언론 및 출판의 자유가 제약되어 있는 중국 사회에서 문인들의 자발성과 순수한 신념에 따라 반부패 문학이 성립된 것은 아니다. 중국의 부정부패는 국가의 운명을 좌지우지할만한 심각한 문제가 되어 버렸고, 이에 체제 전복의 위협마저 느낀 중국 정부에서는 법률과 제도의 개선 뿐 아니라 문예를 수단으로 삼는 부패 방지 대책에 착안하게 되었으며. 이로써 반부패 문학은 이른바 ‘주선율’ 문학, 즉 사회의 주류를 이루는 이념 및 가치를 대변하는 문학의 범주에 진입하게 된 것이다. ‘주선율 문학’은 한 시대의 사회 및 역사 발전의 주요한 추세와 본질적 규율, 그리고 주류 사상 및 이념을 체현하는 것을 목적으로 한다고 할 수 있겠다. 1990년대 이후의 주선율 문학, 즉 정책으로서의 문학은 개혁개방 이전의 폭압적인 매커니즘이 아닌 격려의 매커니즘 속에 지배계급의 이데올로기가 설정해 놓은 틀 안에서 지배계급의 수요를 만족시키는 문학 작품 생산자의 역할을 수행하게 되었다. 그러므로 주선율문학의 한 카테고리를 이루는 반부패소설은 현실 속 부정부패에 대한 비판과 근원에 대한 탐색보다는 통치권 주류 이데올로기의 구현을 우선시해야 하는 태생적 한계를 지닐 수밖에 없는 것이다. 진정한 부패는 공권력을 소유하고 집행하는 체제 내부의 세력들로부터 비롯된다는 사실에 눈을 감은 채, 공산당원으로부터 청백리를 발견할 것을 강요하는 반부패소설이 추구하는 바는, 사실상 인민을 위한 복무도 사회주의를 위한 복무도 아닌, 정권에 대한 눈치 보기와 비위맞추기에 지나지 않는다고 할 수 있다. 영웅의 등장에 의한 사건 해결로 말미암아 반부패소설의 결말은 언제나 통쾌하고 뒤끝이 없다. 그러나 작가의 허약한 이상주의적 신념과 정권의 문예 정책이 만들어낸 소설의 허구성은 현실 속 부패의 뿌리를 감추고 왜곡한다. 결국 부패 문제의 해결은 작가의 상상과 은폐 속에서만 완성될 수 있는 것이며 결과적으로 작가는 국가의 명을 받들어 지배계급 이데올로기의 합법성을 입증해주는 하수인으로써의 역할을 수행하게 되는 것이다.					0	0	0	0	0	1226-7597		KJD:ART001805191		
J	박형진								A Study on the Characteristics of Organic Concept and Interpretation at F. L. Wright and T. Ito’s Architecture			라이트와 이토 건축의 유기적 개념과 해석 특성에 관한 연구					KOREAN INSTITUTE OF INTERIOR DESIGN JOURNAL	한국실내디자인학회 논문집			22	4			23	32					2013	2013	This study represents something in common and differences of organic characteristics between early modern architecture and contemporary architecture analysing F. L. Wright’s Robie House and Toyo Ito’s Sendai Mediatheque. A natural organic body cannot be separated from the natural environment, and each part of an architecture has each own property and forms a whole at the same time. That is a basic concept of organic architecture, and a framework for analysis is set up based on it. The followings are similarities and differences of organic concept and interpretation between Wright’s Robie House and Ito’s Sendai Mediatheque First, Wright’ Robie house unites with the natural surrounding, using a physically close connection to the ground. In contract, Ito’s Mediatheque shows characteristics of noncentural and fluidic space that are metaphorically reflecting tangible and intangible of factors in modern city, where there is an ambiguous physical boundary between architecture and urban environment. Next, floors, walls and ceilings of Wright’s housing as for basic building blocks are physically separated and at the same time form formative unity from the point of view of a physical and structural organic body. And continuous flow of faces of separated walls form an organism united with the nature from a physical aspect. On the contrary to this, there is an no-boudary and floating organic architecture of integrated structure from ambiguous setting of relation between architecture and urban space in Ito’s architecture. Especially, Mediatheque shows semantic integration of floating urban environmental factors through horizontal and vertical integration of horizontal slabs, vertical pipes, and skins. Last, horizontal and vertical factors of Wright’ Housing is appreciated as an basic experienced structure in terms of spacial perception and fluidic inner spaces in Wright’s housing is completed with a series of spatial experiences in a visual sense. On the other hand, no-boundary and floating space of Ito’s architecture accept user’s physical and virtual body. Especially, there is an integration transcending beyond time and space, accepting an imaginary body and events with the course of time at Ito’s Mediatheque.				본 연구는 근대 초기의 유기적 건축과 현대건축의 유기적 특성에 나타나는 공통점과 차이점을 라이트의 초기 주택과 이토의 센다이 미디어 테크를 통해 파악하였다. 자연의 유기체는 주변의 자연 환경으로부터 분리될 수 없으며, 건축물의 부분들은 자체적인 개별성을 지님과 동시에 전체로부터 분리될 수 없다는 유기적 건축의 기본 개념으로부터 분석틀을 설정하였다. 라이트의 초기 주택과 이토의 센다이 미디어 테크에 나타난 유기적 개념과 해석의 유사성 및 차이점은 다음과 같다. 첫째, 라이트의 초기 주택이 물리적으로 대지와 밀착된 관계를 통해 자연과 일체를 이룬다면 이토의 미디어 테크는 현대 도시의 유무형적 요소를 은유적으로 반영한 무중심의 유동적 공간 특성이 나타난다. 둘째, 전체와 부분의 관점에서 라이트의 초기 주택의 기본적 구성요소로서 바닥, 벽체, 천장은 물리적으로 분리됨과 동시에 연속됨으로써 조형적 통일성을 이룬다. 또한 분리된 면의 연속적 흐름은 물리적 측면에서 자연과 통합된 유기성을 형성한다. 반면에 이토의 미디어 테크는 수평의 판, 수직의 관, 외피로 구성되며, 건물에는 메타포적 해석을 통해 부유하는 도시 환경적 요소들의 의미적 통합성이 나타난다. 셋째, 라이트의 초기 주택의 내부의 유동적 공간이 시각적 감각을 통한 연속적 공간 체험을 통해 완성된다면 이토의 미디어 테크에는 시간의 흐름에 따른 이벤트와 가상의 신체를 수용한 시공간을 초월한 통합성이 나타난다.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-7992		KJD:ART001793882		
J	이수진; Kim, Min								A Study of Psychoanalytic Art Therapy based on Jacques Lacan's Theory			자크 라캉(Jacques Lacan)의 이론에 기초한 정신분석적 미술치료 연구					Korean Journal of Art Therapy	미술치료연구			20	3			631	649					2013	2013	This study will shed a light on Psychoanalytic Art Therapy based on Jacques Lacan's theory. The research methodology is a method of psychoanalysis, which Freud straightened out into a method of investigation of a particular subject, a psychotherapeutic method, a group of psychological and psychopathological theories. This study is not only qualitative research but also exploratory research. It draws a conclusion that: Firstly, Lacan's subject investigation of Psychoanalytic Art Therapy is to explain the 3 constituents and fundamental concepts of Psychoanalytic Art Therapy: the subject, the art as object a, and the analyst. Lacan's fundamental concepts of Psychoanalytic Art Therapy explicates the unconscious and drive of the subject, the repetition and projection of the subject through the art, and the desire and transference of the subject towards the analyst. Secondly, Lacan's method of Psychoanalytic Art Therapy is to describe the 2 principles and processes of Psychoanalytic Art Therapy, the 7 techniques of Psychoanalytic Art Therapy possible to apply. The subject can experience two psychotherapeutic procedures that are the process of projection through the art, and transference towards the analyst. While the projection of the subject through art is a process for the subject to discover him/herself in the dual relation of the imaginary of the subject and the art, the transference of the subject towards the analyst a process of the triple relation of the symbolic of the subject, the art and the analyst. Thirdly, Lacan's Psychoanalytic Art Therapy plays a major role in the ethics of life that can help the subject to make self-discovery and self-realization, identify with the symptom, and by extension, keep enduring the act and will towards desire. Therefore, the meaning of Lacan's subject investigation and method of Psychoanalytic Art Therapy proves that it is an independent and singular theory having accumulated its own system.				본 연구는 자크 라캉(Jacques Lacan)의 이론에 기초하여 정신분석적 미술치료를 구명한 연구다. 본 연구의 방법론은 정신분석적 접근법으로, 이 방법은 프로이트가 정신분석을 주체 탐구 방법, 치료 방법, 이론의 세 가지로 정의한 것에 기초한다. 본 연구는 질적 연구인 동시에 탐색 연구다. 본 연구를 통해 얻게 된 결론은 다음과 같다. 첫째, 라캉의 정신분석적 미술치료의 주체 탐구는 정신분석적 미술치료의 세 형성체와 근본 개념을 구명한다. 즉 세 형성체인 분석주체, 대상 a로서의 예술, 분석가는 각각 무의식과 충동, 투사와 반복, 욕망과 전이를 근본 개념으로 한다. 둘째, 라캉의 정신분석적 미술치료 방법은 2가지 정신분석적 미술치료의 원리와 과정, 그리고 7가지 정신분석적 미술치료 기법을 구명한다. 즉 라캉의 정신분석적 미술치료에서 분석주체는 2가지 치료 과정을 경험하는데, 분석주체의 예술을 통한 투사 과정(상상적 2자 관계에서의 자기 발견)과, 분석주체의 분석가에 대한 전이 과정(상징적 3자 관계에서의 자기 발견)이다. 이때 적용 가능한 정신분석적 미술치료 기법은 7가지다. 셋째, 라캉의 정신분석적 미술치료는 분석주체의 자기 발견과 자기 실현, 증상과의 동일화, 삶의 윤리로서 의미를 갖는다. 이처럼 라캉의 정신분석적 미술치료의 주체 탐구와 라캉의 정신분석적 미술치료의 방법을 통해 얻게 된 의미는 그 체계가 응집되어 독자적인 라캉의 정신분석적 미술치료 이론을 구명한다.					0	0	0	0	0	1226-6787		KJD:ART001774961		
J	Hyojeong, Kim; 박정호; 이도준								The interaction between tool affordance and the sense of agency in the Extrastriate Body Area			선조외 신체 영역에서 도구 행동유도성과 행위 주체감의 상호작용					Korean Journal of Cognitive Science	인지과학			24	1			49	69					2013	2013	While we interact with other people or objects, the brain continuously updates our own body schema to recognize the agent of observed actions. The Extrastriate Body Area (EBA) provides an initial interface for the sense of agency by integrating visual inputs of body parts with internal signals related to self-generated body movements. Less is known, however, about how the functional use of tools contributes to such processes. Here, we investigated whether tool-specific affordance would differentially affect the neural responses in the EBA depending on the agency of imaginary actions. In each trial we presented a picture of an object in a rectangular frame. Objects were either the tools typically brought towards the body (body tools; e.g., telescope, earphones) or away from the body (world tools; e.g., pen, dice; Rueschemeyer, Pfeiffer, & Bekkering, 2010). Depending on the color of the frame, participants imagined either themselves or the other person using the tool (self vs. other conditions). These four types of trials were randomly intermixed with blank trials. As results, independently localized right EBA regions of interest showed greater activation when participants imagined themselves using body tools than using world tools whereas no such differential activations were found when they imagined the other person using the tools. The postscan test revealed no significant difference in vividness of imagery between the self and other conditions. Our results suggest that the EBA incorporates functional affordance of tools into the body schema in order to enhance the sense of agency and to guide our own actions.				우리가 타인과 상호작용하거나 물체를 사용하는 동안 뇌에서는 신체 이미지를 추적하고 행위의 주체를 파악하려는 신경 정보처리가 끊임없이 이루어진다. 선조외 시각 피질(Extrastriate Body Area, EBA)은 신체에 관한 시각 입력과 우리 자신의 움직임에 관한 내적 신호들을 통합하여 행위 주체감(sense of agency) 생성을 위한 초기 신경 표상을 제공한다. 그러나 이러한 과정에서 물체의 기능적 특성이 행위 주체에 따라서 어떻게 반영되는지 알려진 바는 거의 없다. 이에 본 연구는 기능성 자기공명 영상 기법을 활용하여 자신 또는 타인이 도구를 사용하는 장면을 참가자들이 상상할 때 도구의 행동유도성(affordance)이 EBA의 신경 반응에 끼치는 영향을 관찰하였다. 각 시행에서 참가자들은 신체를 향해 사용하는 도구(예, 망원경)나 신체 바깥 방향으로 사용하는 도구(예, 주사위)를 제시받았다. 이 때, 도구를 둘러싼 사각형 테두리의 색깔에 따라서 참가자들은 자신 혹은 타인이 그 도구를 사용한다고 상상하였다. 실험 결과, 우반구 EBA는 참가자가 ‘자신’의 행위를 상상할 때 바깥 방향 도구 조건보다 신체 방향 도구 조건에서 더 많이 활성화되었으나, 참가자가 ‘타인’의 행위를 상상할 때는 도구의 사용 방향으로부터 영향을 받지 않았다. 후속 검사에 따르면 자신 조건과 타인 조건에서 각각 상상하는 동안 참가자가 느낀 생동감의 차이는 없었다. 이러한 결과는 EBA가 도구의 행동유도성 정보를 신체 도식에 반영함으로써 행위 주체감을 향상시키고 우리 자신의 행동을 안내하는 데 기여하고 있음을 시사한다.					0	0	0	0	0	1226-4067		KJD:ART001756323		
J	신혜선								Analysis of the course of the main character’s desire formation   in the children’s picture book cloud bread			유아 그림책 구름빵 에 나타난 주인공의 욕망형성 과정 분석					Korean Journal of Early Childhood Education	유아교육연구			33	4			71	93					2013	2013	This study examined the course of the main character’s desire formation in the children’s picture book Cloud Bread from the perspective of Lacan’s desire theory. For this purpose, we analyzed the course of the subject’s division on the sides of the three main concepts in the desire theory, the imaginary, the symbolic order and the real order. As a result of this study, it has been found out that children made their mother and father who initially exist in the symbolic order enter the imaginary to agree with them when they lay hold of clouds in the imaginary. Mother’s concern about father in the symbolic order provokes children’s desire to help him, and this desire is met by the cloud bread created in the imaginary. Children continue to stay in the imaginary abiding their return to the symbolic order by eating the cloud bread again in the real order. This is because the satisfaction of the subject’s desire is fulfilled in the imaginary rather than in the symbolic order, and when returning to the symbolic order, the subject suffers deficiency and dissatisfaction. After all, the cloud bread, which plays the floe of a channel between the imaginary and the symbolic order, make children feel satisfied and deficient at the same time, and serves as a motivation for yearning another desire.				본 연구에서는 Lacan의 욕망이론의 관점에서 유아그림책 ‘구름빵’ 에 나타난 주인공의 욕망형성과정을 고찰해보았다. 이를 위해 욕망이론의 주요개념인 상상계, 상징계, 실재계, 세가지 측면에서 주체의 분열과정을 분석해보았다. 연구결과 상상계에서 아이들은 구름을 손에 넣는 순간 상징계에 있는 엄마와 아빠를 상상계에 편입시켜 자신들의 생각에 동조하게 만든다. 상징계에서 엄마가 아빠를 걱정하는 모습은 아이들에게 아빠를 돕고자 하는 욕망을 불러일으키고 이 욕망은 상상계에서 만든 구름 빵을 통해 충족된다. 실재계에서 아이들은 구름 빵을 또 먹음으로써 상징계로의 복귀를 회피하며 계속 상상계에 머문다. 왜냐하면 아빠를 돕고자 하는 주체의 욕망 충족은 상징계가 아닌 상상계에서 이루어진 것이며, 다시 상징계로 돌아 왔을 때 주체는 충족되지 못한 결핍이 생기기 때문이다. 결국 상상계와 상징계의 통로 역할을 해주었던 구름 빵은 아이들에게 욕망의 충족과 결핍을 동시에 느끼게 해주고 또 다른 욕망을 갈망하게 만드는 동인으로 작용하게 된다.					0	0	0	0	0	1226-9565		KJD:ART001801764		
J	Jung, Kim Hong								The Battle between God Metamorphosed into Society and Messiah under the Mask of Agent: Around the Concept of the Social of Arendt			사회로 변신한 신과 행위자의 가면을 쓴 메시아의 전투: 아렌트의 ʻ사회적인 것ʼ의 개념을 중심으로					Korean Journal of Sociology	한국사회학			47	5			1	33					2013	2013	This article attempts to analyze the semantics of the concept of the social presented by Arendt, and to reveal its difference with the political/the public, at the level of social imaginary. We showed that the social of Arendt comprises i) the national economy appearing between the public and the private ii) the governmentality characterized by self-organization iii) the life style dominated by the norms of mass society. The critic of Arendt as for the social was centered on the liberal imaginary of the social and on its fundamental metaphor of invisible hand. Arendt tried to construct the theology of action which asserts that human political action is capable of changer the society.				이 논문은 아렌트가 제출한 ʻ사회적인 것ʼ의 개념의 의미론을 분석하고, 이와 대립되는 범주로 제시된 ʻ정치적인 것/공적인 것ʼ과의 사회적 상상의 수준에서의 차이를 심층적으로 드러내는 것을 목표로 한다. 연구를 통해서 이 논문은 아렌트의 ʻ사회적인 것ʼ은 i) 공적 영역과 사적 영역 사이에 등장한 국민경제, ii) 자기조절하는 통치성, iii) 대중사회의 규범에 의해 조직되는 삶의 형식을 포괄함을 보였다. 아렌트의 사회적인 것에 대한 비판은 이 개념의 배후에서 작동하는 자유주의적 사회적 상상과 그 핵심 은유인 보이지 않는 손에 대한 비판을 핵심으로 한다. 이에 대립하는 대안으로 아렌트는 인간의 공적 행위(정치적 행위)가 사회세계를 변화시킬 수 있는 가능성을 갖고 있다는 사실에 지대한 이론적 의미를 부여하면서, 사회신학과 대비되는 행위신학을 구성한다. 사회적인 것을 둘러싼 사회 이론과 정치 철학의 논쟁은 이처럼 사회로 변신한 신과 행위자의 가면을 쓴 메시아 사이의 이론적 투쟁에 다름 아님을 논증하였다.					0	0	0	0	0	1225-0120		KJD:ART001817542		
J	Kang, Hyen-mo								Eexamine Aspect of Acceptances of the Folktale Shown  in the <The Dragonfloating under the Earth>			천하에 뜨는 용 에 나타난 설화의 수용양상					Korean Language & Literature	한국언어문학			84				125	147					2013	2013	Eexamine Aspect of Acceptances of the Folktale Shown in the <The Dragonfloating under the Earth> Kang, Hyen-mo The purpose of this research is to examine aspect of acceptances of the folktale shown in the historical novel, <The dragonfloating under the earth(천하에 뜨는 용)>. <The dragon floating under the earth> was made into novel upon the various tales about Yeong-gyu Daesa(영규대사), the commander ofarmy of civil, who had mounted troops In Gapsa when Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592 had broken out. There is so liitle literature records about Yeong-gyu Daesa that one cannot know his detailed account. Yeong-gyu Daesa was one of the Parks who had Giheodang(기허당) as his buddist name.He was also the first pupil of Seosan Daeso from Chengnyeon-am(청련암) in Gapsa(갑사). Yeong-gyu Daesa had gathered the cavalry of civil before anybody else. He and Joheon,his company, had recaptured the Cheongju fortress but he couldn't help but take his last breath with the lose from the Geuman battle. <The dragon floating under the earth> is a conte that consists of 10 chapters. This novel is significant because it is a piece of work about Yeong-gyu Daesa with the background of Japnese Invasion, it takes insertions of many tales and it gives a meaning to Yeong-gyu Daesa's efforts for his fatherland. The novel, <The dragon floating under the earth>, accepts several kinds of tale to emphasize on his heroism. Some of the acceptances is directly relevant to Yeong-gyu Daesa, but some of them are absoultely not. If one takes a look at the novel in the points of the acceptance of tales by chapters, it can be classified in to three. First, a modified acceptance of stories in tales and cases. Second, a realistic modification and an acceptance with imaginations. Third, an acceptance of imaginary stories of tales.									0	0	0	0	0	1229-1730		KJD:ART001755765		
J	Lee, Youngbae								A Study on the Singularity of Korean Shamanism			다중의 습속, 되기 혹은 생성의 사건으로서 무속의 특이성					Korean Shamanism	한국무속학			26				227	259					2013	2013	The purpose of this essay is to explore the specific aspects of cultural singularity in korean shamanism. The korean shamanism is the representations, which consists of imaginary, historical, political, cultural, and ideological events, individual and collective memories, diverse interests and desires. The representations based each social formation in the aspects of history is the media through which we can recognize the singularity of korean shamanism. The representations of korean shamanism have the characteristics of religious event, the elements of rising in arms. They have the reconstructed arrangement of desire which is complicated by articulation, condensation, appropriation, repetition, and accumulation. Therefore, the representation can’t be defined as a single substance. It is the event of rhizomic becoming, which creates in hybrid times of condensed modernization in korean society. In this sense, korean shamanism can be represented by the conjunction with technoetics(or new media-art) in post-modern culture in korean. This paper try to reveal those points. Hopefully, this study is a trigger to extend the horizon of shamanism study in korea folklore.				이 글은 무속 혹은 무 집단이 텍스트 내(혹은 체제 내)에 표상되어온 방식을 검토하여 무속 혹은 무속 표상의 다중적 성격을 규명하려고 했다. 특히 무속과 인접예술의 관계를 묻는 문제를 되짚어보는 방식으로 주체와 양식, 그리고 원리의 차원에서 무속의 성격과 특성을 검토하고 무속과 인접예술의 연구 방향과 전망을 제기해 보았다. 무속의 주체 문제는 편의상 시대적인 흐름을 따라가며, 기록되고 해석된 무속의 표상을 거슬러 독해하는 방식으로 짚어보았다. 무속의 예술적 특성과 원리에 대해서는 무속을 일종의 생성의 사태로 규정하고 논의를 전개하였다. 구조적인 측면에서 무속이 ‘일－놀이’의 특징을 지님과 동시에 ‘제의－놀이’적 특징도 지니기 때문에, 생계－예능의 구조를 근간으로 의례－예능이 구현되고 수준 높은 전문성이 발현되는 것으로 논의하였다. 비근대 무속의 양식적 특성에서 근대 혹은 탈근대적 문제설정을 위해 그 과도기적 특징을 살펴보았다. 비근대 무속의 양식적 특성은 일제강점기를 거쳐 70년대까지 일정하게 유지되었는데, 그 과정에서 토대(생산양식)의 구속력이 완강하게 작동하는 영역과 완만하게 이완되는 영역이 있음에 주목하였다. 무속의 특이성에 대한 논의에서 형태의 변화와, 이접적 생성을 연관짓고자 했으며 그러한 사례로서 테크노에틱 아트를 검토하였다. 이에 더하여 무속과 유비쿼터스의 공통 원리와 특징을 논의하면서 무속 연구의 방향도 함께 모색하였다. 마지막 논의는 문화사회의 대안적 지향과 무속의 주변성 혹은 외부성의 조우로 귀결되었고 이에 관한 연구 과제를 제기하는 정도에 그쳤다. 앞으로 제기된 문제를 더욱 심화하는 연구를 진행시켜야 한다. 표상의 전복적 독해에 대한 이론적 검토와 함께, 분석 자료를 세부적으로 나누어 살필 필요성이 있다. 무속 연구의 확장을 위해 테크노에틱 아트(혹은 미디어 아트)와 같은 예술 장르를 무속과 비교하여 연구하는 것도 유익할 것이다.					0	0	0	0	0	1738-1614		KJD:ART001750383		
J	Kim, Ilhwan								Text Type and Frequency of Language Use			텍스트 유형과 어휘의 사용 빈도					Language & Information Society	언어와 정보 사회			19				161	201					2013	2013	This paper aims to explore some linguistic features to distinguish four major text types, newspaper, magazine, informative text and imaginary text based on SJ-RIKS corpus. In fact, most of native speakers are able to distinguish these texts relying on their experience and knowledge about text information. However without this information we often have some difficulty classifying which category these texts belong to. Our discussion starts from the supposition that most texts can be classified based on their linguistic features, especially morphological and syntactic features. For this purpose we selected 8 lexical categories and 7 grammatical categories. After that we investigated how these linguistic features are represented in text types. In doing so, we are able to find that there are meaningful and coherent relations between text type and language use. These generalized results are helpful to distinguish four major text types quantitatively and effectively.									0	0	0	0	0	1598-1886		KJD:ART001773479		
J	Mariani, Maria Anna								Zeno autobiografoZeno, autobiographer								Lettere Italiane	이탈리아어문학			40				301	332					2013	2013	Il triestino Svevo parlava dunque due lingue, come si potrebbe dedurre gia solo esaminando il suo nome, che fa riferimento a due patrie: l’Italia (con Italo) e la Germania (con Svevo). Pio che di nome, sarebbe pero corretto parlare di pseudonimo, perche all’anagrafe il futuro scrittore fu registrato come Aron Hector Schmitz. Italo Svevo e allora una maschera sonora, una copertura che cela l’autentica, segreta identita racchiusa nel nome proprio. La scelta di uno pseudonimo non e mai casuale e in questo caso sembra riflettere un’orgogliosa dichiarazione di identita bi-linguistica. Una dichiarazione forse fin troppo orgogliosa, perche non e vero che Svevo padroneggiasse perfettamente entrambe le lingue. La sua prima lingua era il tedesco, anzi, il dialetto triestino; mentre l’italiano lo parlava e scriveva da straniero, grazie allo studio libresco, quotidiano e faticoso. L’italiano di Svevo e percio spurio, ovvero impuro, corrotto, germanizzato: lo si nota soprattutto nella morfologia dell’articolo, nell’uso erroneo delle preposizioni e nella anomala distribuzione delle consonanti all’interno di parola. A essere particolarmente dura e poi la sintassi, inasprita da numerosi calchi dal tedesco. L’effetto di lettura e a volte disturbante e fino a qualche decennio fa critici letterari e linguisti dibattevano con accanimento intorno al modo di scrivere di Svevo, giudicandone la prosa contorta, sgrammaticata, brutta. I canoni sui quali era impostato il dibattito erano quelli del bello e del brutto scrivere, categorie vaghe e del tutto soggettive; ma il giudizio pesava, sembrava impossibile da rimuovere. Oggi invece il mistilinguismo di Svevo e considerato un apprezzato elemento della sua originalita, un personalissimo tratto di stile. La scrittura dell’autore non e pio vista come un insieme di errori grammaticali e sintattici da condannare, ma come un innovativo e deliberato progetto di dissoluzione dell’italiano tradizionale.This essay is focused on La coscienza di Zeno by Italo Svevo. It is structured in four parts and it starts with a general introduction to the author, sketching of him an actualized and not conventional image. This first part insists on the peculiar linguistic condition of Svevo, who – treating Italian as a foreign language – could be compared to a stranger writer in his own country. The essay continues by concentrating on La coscienza di Zeno, that is a peculiar kind of autobiography, written by an imaginary character who does not coincide with the author. Even though La coscienza is a work of fiction, it shares many of the elements that define an authentic autobiography. For instance, the book is crossed with reflections on memory and identity, which are the crucial problems of the autobiographic genre. By adopting a comparative method, but never forgetting the rigour of Literary Theory, this essay compares passages from La coscienza with excerpts from canonical autobiographies (mainly Elias Canetti’s one) and tries to open a wide-range perspective for an actualized and problematic study of Italo Svevo’s work.									0	0	0	0	0	1598-5598		KJD:ART001843887		
J	M., Reed Brain								“Some Old Dream of Kingship”: Christopher Brennan’s Poems (1913) and Modernism’s Place								Lingua Humanitatis	인문언어			15	3			123	139					2013	2013	[Abstract] “Some Old Dream of Kingship”:Christopher Brennan’s Poems (1913) and Modernism’s Place Brian M. Reed(University of Washington) Australian poetry rarely plays a role in academic narratives about the origins of English-language literary modernism. This essay spotlights Christopher Brennan’s italies (1913) as an example of a text that deserves more widespread attention. Its author recoils from the historical processes pushing Australia to separate from Britain, and he recognizes that the “old dream of kingship,” the colonial imaginary, cannot be sustained intact and inviolate. He responds by withdrawing from the world and self-reflexively? exalting the book as the only place the old magic can survive. Modernism, in this scenario, is born through evasion, displacement, and escape. What saves italies-what insures that it is more than retro-imperial escapism--is its thorough-going disruptive, broken texture. The act of imagination necessary to reject decolonization wrenches language until it becomes strange and new.									0	0	0	0	0	1598-2130		KJD:ART001837452		
J	Yang, Mi-young								A Study on Antigrowth Characters and Subjectivation: A Psychoanalysis on Kim Young－ha’s “I Hear Your Voice”			반(反)성장 서사 인물과 주체화 기획의 문제 - 김영하 장편소설 『너의 목소리가 들려』를 중심으로					Literary Criticism	비평문학			50				179	207					2013	2013	<Abstract> A Study on Antigrowth Characters and Subjectivation:A Psychoanalysis on Kim Young－ha’s “I Hear Your Voice” Yang, Mi-young This study argues that Antigrowth novel has to be admitted individually, although the concept of 'Antigrowth' in literature has been dealt with discourse of Initiation novel. This essay, therefore, suggests forms of juvenile characters’ subjectivation in ‘antigrowth’ narrative, analysing Kim Young－ha’s “I Hear Your Voice” with basic concepts of psychoanalysis. The main characters (J and Tong－gyu) in “I Hear Your Voice” are isolated in their own world and suffered from the other world that is ‘society’. They cannot become ‘normal’ grownups but end up dead. The unconscious of J and Tong－gyu is analysed like below. J is an orphan and has eager desire to communicate with others. However, his experiences of abandonment make him narcissist and evil. In addition, he is built as a subject who desires to be imaginary phallus. J earns the support of teenage runaways and enjoys mimicking the system of Symbolic. The corrupted desire for power does not lead him to the symbolic way of grownups, but he slides into Real driven by Thanatos came from narcissism. On the contrary to J, Tong－gyu wants to be an orphan fleeing from complicated family affairs. He regards J as his alter ego and follows him unconditionally. Tong－gyu seems to be fixated on J’s desire. In fact, Tong－gyu has a desire to be ‘a desire of J’. However, after all, Tong－gyu, is disappointed to J who is arrogant and full of vanity. As Tong－gyu comes to realise that J is lack and devoid, finally, he wants to be a self as subject planning to kill J. Nevertheless, he rather feels guilty of murder, fails to mourn, and internalises J deeply in the end. Tong－gyu kills himself at last and becomes stranded in Imaginary. As we can see, there are two types of juvenile characters and subjectivation in antigrowth narrative. The first type is the heroic character like J who denies and refuses Symbolic, desires to be a perverse subject and proceeds toward Real. The second type is the tragic character that plans subjectivation him/herself but fails and is caught in Imaginary like Tong－gyu. They have in common that both cannot belong to Symbolic and become ‘adults’, as well as they have differences that they are heading for separate ways ― Real and Imaginary.				<국문 초록> 지금까지 ‘반(反)성장’이라는 개념은 성장소설의 논의 안에서 함께 다루어져 왔다. 그러나 반성장 서사를 성장소설의 한 면이 아닌 개별적으로 살펴볼 필요가 있다는 것이 이 논문의 관점이다. 따라서 이 논문의 목적은 반성장 소설에서 청소년 인물의 주체화 문제가 어떤 양상으로 나타나는지 정신분석학적으로 살펴보는 데에 있으며, 이를 위해 김영하의 장편소설 『너의 목소리가 들려』의 등장인물을 분석했다. 『너의 목소리가 들려』는 반성장소설로, 자신들만의 세계에 고립되어 있으며 외부 사회로부터 받는 고통에 괴로워하다 ‘정상적인’ 주체로 성장하지 못하고 결국 죽음에 이르고 마는 소년들의 삶을 그리고 있다. 두 주인공 제이와 동규는 수동적 성장보다는 능동적 퇴행과 탈선을 선택하여 나름의 주체화를 꾀하는 반성장 인물인데, 정신분석학적 관점에서 제이는 상징계 진입을 거부하고 실재계로 미끄러지는 양상을 보여주고 있다. 그의 자아는 자의적으로 ‘어른 되기’를 거부하는데, 다시 말해 제이는 통상·사회적인 성장을 거부하고 상징계가 아닌 곳에서 스스로 상징(권력)이 되고자하는 나르시시스트적 주체화를 시도하는 인물이다. 한편 동규는 반성장 서사 인물의 또 다른 형태를 보여준다. 자의적으로 성장을 거부한다기보다는, 주체화를 기획하여 상상계적 미성숙 상태에서 벗어나려고 하지만 실패하고 좌절하여 결국 성장의 단계로 나아가지 못하고 상상계에 남게 되어버리는 양상이다. 제이와 동규의 경우로 미루어 볼 때, 반성장 인물의 주체화 양상은 두 가지 유형으로 나누어 볼 수 있다. 첫 번째 유형은 스스로 상징계를 부정하고 거부하는 ‘비껴나간’ 주체가 되어 실재계로 향하는 영웅적 인물형이고, 두 번째 유형은 주체화의 기획을 통하여 상징계로의 진입을 꾀하지만 실패하여 상상계에 고착하는 비극적 인물형이다. 제이와 동규는 둘 다 상징계에 속하지 못하여 ‘어른’이 되지 못했다는 공통점과, 각각 실재계와 상상계로 그 행보를 달리했다는 차이점을 동시에 가지고 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	1225-0430		KJD:ART001841121		
J	오주리											황동규(黃東奎) 초기 시(詩)에 나타난 나르시시즘의 사랑 연구 - 『어떤 개인 날』을 중심으로|A study on the narcissistic love in the Dong－Gyu Hwang’s early poems – focusing on 『One Fine Day』					Literary Criticism	비평문학			50				229	254					2013	2013	<Abstract> A study on the narcissistic love in the Dong－Gyu Hwang’s early poems– focusing on 『One Fine Day』 Oh, Ju-ri The purpose of this study is to examine the narcissistic love in the Dong－Gyu Hwang’s early poems focusing on 『One Fine Day』. Hwang is the poet in the generation of the April 19th Democratic Revolution(1960). His poetry is beyond the colonial consciousness and the nihilistic consciousness of postwar era. His early poems are characteristic of the pure lyricism of the adolescence. The love in his early poems is the narcissistic love as the inner love of the young poet. According to Julia Kristeva’s psychoanalytic theory, this thesis is constituted. The chapter II covers the phase of the identification in the narcissistic love. The identification is formed between the subject of the love and the object of the love by the inner screen(ecran) as Narcissus’s water－mirror. On the other hand, the screen is the shield between the subject and the object. In the Hwang’s poems, the images of ‘River’ or ‘Ice’ have the function of the inner screen for the identification of the narcissistic love. The chapter III covers the phase of the idealization in the narcissistic love. The idealization is formed between the subject of the love and the object of the love by the function of the enunciation for the Other. In the Hwang’s poems, ‘Letter’, ‘Postcard’ and ‘Prayer’ are the enunciations that make the other idealistic being. The idealization makes the narcissistic love get to the maximum of the subjectivity. On the other hand, the idealistic other frustrates the subject of the love. The aggressivity for the other in the narcissistic love comes from the frustration of the subject. In the Hwang’s poems, the images of the actions such as ‘Waiting’ or ‘Sirum’(Korean traditional wrestling) are expressed as the tragic phase of the idealization in the narcissistic love. The chapter IV covers the thanatos of the narcissistic love. Thanatos means death－drive in the psychoanalysis. The conflict between the subject of the love and the object of the love is concluded at the defeat of the subject. It is a kind of self－sacrifice for his lover. Such a self－sacrificial subject experiences the imaginary death in the poems. In the ends, the death for his lover becomes the most sublime action. In Hwang’s poems, ｢Pieta｣is such a representative work. Finally, in the chapter V, I summarizes this thesis. In addition, the narcissistic love in Hwang’s poems includes the characteristics of the non－genital love of the adolescence. 『One fine day』 is the chastity for his lover of the young poet.				<국문 초록> 이 논문의 목적은 황동규의 초기 시에 나타난 나르시시즘의 사랑(the narcissistic love)을 『어떤 개인 날』을 중심으로 구명하는 것이다. 황동규는 4.19 민주화 혁명 세대의 시인이다. 그의 시는 식민지의식과 전후 허무의식을 넘어선다. 그의 초기시편들은 미성년 시기의 순수한 서정성을 특징으로 한다. 그러한 사랑은 젊은 시인의 내면의 사랑으로서의 나르시시즘의 사랑이라고 할 수 있다. 줄리아 크리스테바의 정식분석학적 이론을 원용하여 그러한 논제를 증명하고자 한다. II장은 나르시시즘의 ‘사랑의 동일시(identification)’의 국면을 다룬다. 동일시는 사랑의 주체와 타자 사이에서 내면에 비치는 화면(screen)으로서의 나르시스의 물거울에 형성된다. 반면에, 그 화면은 주체와 타자를 가로막는 차폐막이 되기도 한다. 황동규의 시편들에서는 ‘강’과 ‘얼음’의 이미지들이 나르시시즘의 사랑에서의 동일시에 대한 내면의 화면으로서의 기능을 갖는다. III장은 나르시시즘의 ‘사랑의 이상화’의 국면을 다룬다. 사랑의 주체와 타자의 이상화의 국면은 대타자(the Other)에 대한 언술행위(enunciation)에 의해 형성된다. 황동규의 시편들에서 ‘편지’, ‘엽서’ 그리고 ‘기도’는 타자를 이상적인 존재로 만드는 언술행위들이다. 이상화는 나르시시즘의 사랑을 주체성(subjectivity)의 절정에 이르게 한다. 반면에 이상화된 타자는 사랑의 주체를 위협한다. 나르시시즘의 사랑에서 타자에 대한 공격성(aggressivity)은 그러한 주체의 위협으로부터 온다. 황동규의 시에서 ‘기다림’ 또는 ‘씨름’ 등의 행위들의 이미지는 나르시시즘의 사랑에서의 이상화의 비극적인 국면을 표현한다. IV장은 나르시시즘의 ‘사랑의 죽음충동(thanatos)’를 다룬다. 타나토스는 정신분석학에서 죽음충동을 의미한다. 사랑의 주체와 타자 사이의 대립은 주체의 패배로 귀결된다. 그것은 자신의 연인에 대한 일종의 자기희생이다. 그러한 자기희생적 주체는 시 안에서 상상적 죽음을 겪는다. 결국, 그의 연인의 죽음은 가장 숭고한 행위가 된다. 황동규의 시편들에서 ｢피에타｣는 그러한 것이 재현된 작품이다. 마지막으로 V장에서는 이 논문의 결론을 맺으며 황동규 시의 나르시시즘의 사랑은 젊고 순수한 시인의 비성애적(non－genital)이고도 미성년적인 사랑이란 특성을 내포하고 있다는 점을 덧붙인다.					0	0	0	0	0	1225-0430		KJD:ART001841123		
J	Farra-Haddad, Nour								Staging the Extraordinary Emergence of Divine Entities in the Daily Life of a Visionary House in Beirut								mediterranean review				6	1			43	64					2013	2013	Catherine, a Maronite resident of Nab'a (Beirut), married and the mother of three children, claims that for the past twenty years she has “seen” and been “kidnapped” by the Virgin Mary and the saints. Hundred of Christian and Muslim devotees meet regularly in her house, which has almost been turned into a sanctuary. At Catherine's house, the presence of the divine is built up through an interplay between the visionary, the faithful, the priests and the saints. Every Tuesday the divine manifests itself through the body of the visionary by means of ecstasies and on Good Friday each year stigmata appear on the body of Catherine, on her front, her feet, her hands and her side. The saints, as a spiritual force, overcome her and possess her body. Their interventions seem very precise and ritualized. The miracle expected - "descent of the saints", "divine messages", appearance of the stigmata - is within a spectrum of actions. Our discussion will present the ritualized intervention of the saints by focusing on the performance itself. In other words we will approach the performance of the visionary and the actors around her as an art on the borders between the real and the imaginary. We will focus on the pace of ceremonies marked by moments of variable intensity. This rhythm gives the ritual both the aspect of a well-settled "performance" at times and that of an unexpected or even disorganized one at other times. It plays an essential role in the staging of the extraordinary emergence of divine entities in the daily life of an ordinary household.									0	0	0	0	0	2005-0836		KJD:ART001779723		
J	Sukyung, Chung											현대 숭고이론에서 상상력의 위상에 관한 고찰: 장-프랑수아 리오타르의 아방가르드 숭고론의 경우|An Inquiry on the Waning of Imagination in the Theory of the Sublime of Jean Francois Lyotard					Mihak -The Korean Journal of Aesthetics	美學(미학)			76				141	174					2013	2013	Imagination is the key notion to explain the sublime in the modern aesthetics of Kant and Burke. But the contemporary theories of the sublime parenthesizes the imagination (as in Lyotard’s) or gives a warning on the negative functions of the imagination (as in Lacan’s). This paper tries to manifest the reason of this waning of imagination and to suggest the genuine aesthetic value or the humanistic value of the sublime through the theory of the sublime of Jean-Francois Lyotard. In Kant’s theory, the imagination’s inability to make a total representation of the huge or the overwhelming in nature cause the pain or displeasure to the mind. But when the imagination find its purposiveness toward the Reason by the fact that it can think about the totality of the huge or the overwhelming, the realization bring the mind the delight of the sublime. So the imagination is the master key. But Lyotard regard the great Avant-Garde art works as the objects of the sublime. The indeterminacy by the negativity of the Avant-Garde to violate or private the established norms of arts bring the pain or displeasure to the thinking subject for he cannot recognize the meaning of the work. But the failure is not of the imagination but of the recognition. And he suggests the two ways of rising of the pleasure of the sublime without an imaginary reconciliation. One is that the duration of the indeterminacy causes the intensification of the human ability to think as in the works of Marcel Duchamp. The other is that the art work reminds the viewer of the presence of the human through its material presence itself. There’s no place for imagination in Lyotard’s schema of the sublime. The reason Lyotard parenthesizes the imagination is that it can be appropriate by the bad intentioned powers or the grand narratives. As a Jewish philosopher, Lyotard well knew the catastrophic results of the imaginary identifications lacking of critical reasoning. So he deters the imagination as an ability of identification and promotes the ability of critical thinking on the indeterminacy.				상상력은 근대미학에서 숭고의 감정을 설명하는 핵심 개념이다. 그러나 현대의 숭고이론들은 상상력에 대해 함구하거나(리오타르) 상상력의 부정적인 역할에 대해 경종을 울리는(라캉) 경향이 있다. 이 논문은 장-프랑수아 리오타르의 숭고론을 통해 이처럼 상상력의 위상이 낮아진 까닭을 살펴보고, 리오타르가 상상력 없는 숭고 개념을 통해 개진하려 했던 미적 가치, 인간적 가치를 드러내는 것을 목표로 한다. 숭고와 상상력을 가장 분명히 연관 지었던 칸트의 숭고론에서 상상력은 너무나 거대하거나 위력적인 자연 대상들 앞에서 전체로서의 표상을 만들어내지 못하거나 심한 정신의 위축을 겪으면서 불쾌/고통을 겪게 되는데, 이 때 상상력이 자신이 총괄하지 못한 대상의 전체성, 그 무한함을 생각은 할 수 있다는 점에서 이성이념을 향한 스스로의 합목적성을 발견하거나, 일정한 안전의 확보를 통해 그 자연 대상의 위력을 상상적으로 극복하게 되면 이러한 불쾌가 해소되고 쾌가 생산된다. 칸트의 숭고론은 상상력의 유희를 중심으로 구성되어 있는 것이다. 그러나 리오타르는 자연 대상들 대신 아방가르드 예술작품들을 숭고의 대상으로 삼는다. 이때 숭고의 제 1계기라 할 수 있는 고통의 국면은 기존 예술 규범을 위반하고 박탈하는 아방가르드의 부정성이 배태한 작품 의미의 비결정성에 의해 그 대상에 대한 의미를 규정하려는 인식 주체에게 초래된다고 간주된다. 이는 상상력의 실패가 아니라 인식적 의미화의 실패로 규정된다. 또한 그런 상황에서 불쾌/고통의 상상적 해소를 통하지 않고 쾌가 발생되는 유형을 두 가지로 보았다. 하나는 뒤샹의 작품에 해당되는 경우로서 비결정성의 지속이 인간의 사유 능력을 강화하는 가운데 쾌를 발생시키는 것이다. 다른 하나는 바넷 뉴먼의 작품에 해당되는 경우로서, 작품의 물질적 현존 속에서 계시되는 인간의 현존을 깨달음으로써 쾌가 생겨나는 것이다. 이처럼 리오타르는 자신의 숭고 도식에서 상상력을 지워버렸다. 리오타르가 상상력을 괄호 친 까닭은 상상력이 거대서사에 의해 전용되어 인간성을 억압하는 데 동원되어온 현실적 문제 때문이다. 아우슈비츠를 겪은 유태인 철학자로서 리오타르는 비판력이 결여된 상상적 동일시가 얼마나 참혹한 결과를 낳는지 알고 있었고, 그리하여 동일시의 능력으로서의 상상력을 억제하고 비결정성에 대한 비판적 사유의 능력을 진작하고자 했던 것이다.					0	0	0	0	0	1225-0732		KJD:ART001830109		
J	윤방실								A Lacanian Reading of Harold Pinter's Dumb Waiter			라캉적 시각에서 본 덤웨이터					Modern Studies in English Language and Literature	현대영어영문학			57	3			101	124					2013	2013	This essay aims to psychologically analyze two characters, Gus and Ben, in Harold Pinter's Dumb Waiter in terms of their language and action. For this, some Lacanian terms are used as critical tools; ‘ideal ego,’ ‘ego ideal,’ ‘the imaginary,’ ‘the symbolic,’ ‘signifier,’ ‘signified,’ ‘trauma,’ ‘empty speech,’ ‘full speech,’ and ‘object a.’ Some of these are, of course, not Lacan's original terms. In the basement room which stands for the symbolic controlled by the big Other, master signifier, Wilson, their conversations go around in circles and their actions are repeated to no purpose, with Gus being viewed as the ideal ego in the imaginary using empty speech, and Ben seen as the ego ideal employing full speech. They also, as speech subjects, have to wait for the big Other's order or decision, when the chain of the signifier is in a tangle. Accordingly their language and actions are seriously affected by the pressure from the big Other. Gus, suffering from that pressure as well as the trauma of killing a girl, is trapped with the narcissistic ego at the mirror phase of the imaginary and shows a tint of insubordination or infidelity to Wilson. That's why Ben who seeks to solidify the symbolic world for the big Other and himself as well, is doomed to kill his partner Gus.									0	0	0	0	0	1738-7620		KJD:ART001799524		
J	이영준								On the Ontological Tragedy in Sons and Lovers: ‘The Impossibility of LoveThere Is No Sexual Relationship Between Man and Woman			아들과 연인들 에 나타난 존재론적 비극: ‘사랑의 불가능성 남녀관계 그런 것은 없다.’					Modern Studies in English Language and Literature	현대영어영문학			57	2			133	153					2013	2013	For Lacan, desire cannot be satisfied even when our demands are met. The lack of being is the cause of constructing love-illusions. The act of love is caught up in fantasies. Morel, Gertude, Paul, Miriam and Clara fall in love in Sons and Lovers, but their relationships are found out as self-deceptions. Their love has been mediated through the 'object a' without which love is impossible at all. Each of lovers is positioned at an 'object a', promising the fulfillment of being by their Imaginary integration. However, this is a mis-recognition; in love, there is only the signifying process of metonymic displacement. Furthermore, the love-illusions are manipulated by the sexual differences through 'all' and 'not-all' or 'Having the Phallus and 'Being the Phallus.' Men and women are camouflaged according to their gender roles under the structural effects of the Phallus. This kind of sexual relationship inevitably ends in a disaster. Sons and Lovers unveils an ontological tragedy - the impossibility of love, and the lack of being is the criminal of causing the existential tragedy of love.									0	0	0	0	0	1738-7620		KJD:ART001773928

These archetypes have reappeared differently in the narrative forms of myth, legend, folk tales and fairy tales. Fairy tales, a literary form of bourgeoisie society, repeatedly regenerates a particular archetype of desire and illusion with ideological bias. “Sleeping Beauty”, “Snow White” and “Rapunzel” contain typical images of the idealized women designed to satisfy the imaginary needs of the patriarchal men. These tales are a sort of ‘romantic myth’: the beautiful damsel in suffering and distress by bad dragon should be rescued by the brave knight. The heroines have the customized images by the bourgeoisie ideology in which beauties can be manipulated by human arts. These women look like fairies and nymphs or they are ‘bimbo types’ who are beautiful but not intelligent. The patriarchal images of women have the power of culturally determining forces, thus, structuring the desire and illusion of men. The ‘romantic myth’ exposes an archetypal form of love – a fantasy of men filled with the prejudices of the bourgeoisie society.									0	0	0	0	0	1738-7620		KJD:ART001825210		
J	Park, Geum Hee								The Grotesque Realism in Charles Dickens's Novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood			『에드윈 드루드의 비밀』의 그로테스크 리얼리즘					Nineteenth Century Literature in English	19세기 영어권 문학			17	1			27	52					2013	2013	It is well-known that Charles Dickens wrote his novels to reform a variety of problems in his society. There is no exception in his last and unfinished novel, The Mystery of Edwin Drood. Here he criticizes the Anglican Church because he thought it was neglecting its duties toward its society as well as its congregation. Dickens believed many church leaders must play an important role in their social changes, but they were satisfied just with their routines in serious mannerisms. Dickens sets this novel in the small, imaginary of Cloisterham (which means a monastery corridor), where church doctrines are absolute. He portrays the cathedral and the heroes working in or being influenced by it with Rabelaisian grotesque form, and shows how much all things in the residents' lives were being affected by the church. Through this narrative, Dickens succeeds in blocking his readers' negative response and carrying his critical massage effectively. So that his readers can enjoy reading, he characterizes Cloiterham Cathedral and the main characters by combining some imageries representing something noble, spiritual, transcendent, divine with other imageries expressing something low, animalistic or worldly. The mixture of such opposite and heterogeneous imageries results in letting his readers think about whether what they have believed is true, and recognize various problems of the Christianity and the politics they have supported without any direct and negative statements. In M. M. Bakhtin's perspective, this narrative can be explained with the concept, 'degradation,' one of Rabelaisian stylistic characteristics. Also, it enables Dickens to create grotesque and comical imageries in this novel and show how the church image is different from what his readers accept as normal. Furthermore, through parody of public culture, such as children's plays and Christmas festivals, Dickens enhances the comicality both in characterization and narration as well as makes his readers enjoy reading. This can be explained as the Rabelaisian carnival-grotesque concept of liberation and resurrection in that it is not the criticism just for criticism.									0	0	0	0	0	1598-3269		KJD:ART001743845		
J	정진만								The Limit of Crossing the Boundary: Family-formation by Miscegenation and the Myth of Hybridity in the Novels of Child and Cooper			경계 넘어서기의 한계: 차일드와 쿠퍼의 소설에 나타나는 이종혼의 가족형성과 혼종성 신화					Nineteenth Century Literature in English	19세기 영어권 문학			17	2			109	133					2013	2013	This essay investigates the politics of cultural and territorial expansionism in the representations of miscegenation and cross-cultural hybridity, in Lydia Maria Child's Hobomok (1824) and James Fenimore Cooper's The Pioneers (1823). In Child's Hobomok, in the early colonial period Mary's seemingly radical choice of intermarriage with Hobomok, a native in Massachusetts, cannot transcend safely the taboo of crossing the racial/ethnic boundary prevalent in Mary's and/or Child's age. In terms of mutual acculturation between Hobomok and Mary, the author biasedly foregrounds that Hobomok is Europeanized rather than the other way around, which means crossing the boundary does not make white Americans' identity unstable at all. Additionally, Child portrays Hobomok's later renunciation of his marital status as an inevitable course prepared for a doomed Indian. Little Hobomok, a hybrid progeny symbolizing the (imaginary) reconciliation between the two racial parties, eventually loses his Indian heritage. In The Pioneers, similarly, unifying myth in the formative period of the United States is provided not only in the symbolic miscegenation between Elizabeth Temple (a representative of white pioneers in newly-built New York) and Oliver Edwards (a symbolic descendant of the vanishing Delawares) but also in the hybridization of several figures like Natty Bumppo, Oliver, and Indian John Mohigan. However, it turns out to be a rhetorical gesture imaginatively solving some historical tension from the whites' encroachments of Indians' lands. As in the case of Hobomok, crossing the boundary in The Pioneers does not actually endanger white Americans' identity in terms of blood and culture, which testifies the author's valorizing of asymmetrical and hegemonical relationship between the two racial groups. More than that, Cooper's portrayals of symbolic intermarriage between Elizabeth and Oliver elaborately pave way for rationalizing white Americans' entitlement of Indians' land. Besides, this essay identifies that Indianized Natty's romantic impulse to escape from the restrains of the Eastern civilized world is weirdly converted into a pathfinder's desire for westward expansion. Also, this essay examines how Natty's ostensibly sympathizing attitude toward a degenerated Indian John is involved with expansionist rhetoric often employed by a lot of Jacksonian politicians who campaigned for Indian removal into the West. This study would help us to understand that Child and Cooper conceal and reveal simultaneously expansionist rhetoric in diverse ways, in conformity with their contemporary (mis)belief of Manifest Destiny, in spite of (or more precisely because of) their construction of unifying “myth” between white Americans and Native Americans.									0	0	0	0	0	1598-3269		KJD:ART001799601		
J	김재숙								The Aesthetic Meaning of the 'Mountain-Water' Space expressed in 'Three Distances'			삼원법에 나타난 산수공간의 미학적 의미					Philosophia , Journal of Korean Philosophical Society	철학연구			125				83	107					2013	2013	Guo-xi presented the 'three distances', that is high-distance, deep-distance, level-distance. And then he established the law of perspective in Shan-shui landscape painting. This study is to research the aesthetic meaning of the ‘mountain-water' space in Shan-shui landscape painting centering on 'three disctances' from Guo-xi's Lin-quan-gao-zhi(The Great Message of Forests and Streams) in nothern Song period. By the law of perspective, the three-dimensional space is converted into the two-dimensional plane of the picture. Unlike western perspective, three distances is composed of the moving visual-point and multiple viewpoint. It is not only the problem of the pictorial plot and technic, but also the philosophical and aesthetic subject. Shan-shui landscape painting is not the drawing of mountain-water (streams, rivers), but those of the space with mountain-water and the space with heaven-earth. Mountain-water space is the space of unworldlyness and absence of vulgarity. The literati who lived in the worldly space sometimes longed for the space of the eremitism far away the social and moral, oridinary life. They wanted the space and time of rambling about this space without destination and cultivating their nature. Shan-shui landscape painting substituted for their desires, instead of leaving the mundane society and going the mountain. The perspective suitable to these purpose is the Three Distances. First, mountain-water space is the space of after-experience and imaginary travel lying in the room. Second, mountain-water space is the infinite and transcendental space full of Qi-spirit from the thought of Laozi and Chuangzi. For the embodying this thought, the picture is largely composed of empty space. Third, mountain-water space is the those of cultivation. The empty space full of Qi-spirit is the space of the 'fast of the mind', that is to empty the mind, to clear out the mundane refuse. Accordingly the painters and appreciators could amplyfy and extend their mind infinitly into the mind of Heaven-Earth.				산수화는 산수를 심미적 대상으로 바라보게 됨으로써 나타나게 되는 회화예술양식이다. 유가적 출사관에서 나온 은일처로서의 산수 의식과 도가적 은일문화에서 나온 산수의 아름다움이라는 의식이 송대 문인사대부들에 의해 종합되어 산수화라는 주요 예술장르가 나타났다. 송대 산수화론을 대표하는 곽희의 임천고치 에서는 인간의 삶에 관계되는 공간으로 현실세속공간과 임천의 탈속공간, 두 공간을 제시하고 있다. 현실세속공간은 시끌벅적하고 고삐와 쇠사슬처럼 인간을 구속하는 진효강쇄(塵囂韁鎖)의 성격을 지니고 있기에 이 구속에서 벗어나게 해주는 또다른 공간이 요구된다. 그 곳은 “미적 만족감에서 오는 즐거움을 주면서 마음을 사로잡는,” “아름다운 공간”(佳處)이다. 임천탈속공간에 대한 근원적 그리움을 만족시켜주면서도 현실에 충실할 수 있는 매개가 산수화이다. 삼차원의 산수공간을 실제로 체험하는 것처럼 느끼게 해주는 이차원의 원근법이 바로 삼원법이다. 회화에서 시점과 구도의 문제는 기법의 문제이면서 시각인식체계와 심미의식을 반영하는 미학적 주제와 연결된다. 특히 삼원법은 기법 이상의 사상을 함축하고 있다. 곽희는 고원, 심원, 평원의 삼원법을 제출하여 산수화의 원근법을 정립시켰다. 서양화의 일점 투시에서는 풍경이란 ‘나’ 밖에 있는 세계에 불과하다. 그곳은 소요유할 수 있는 공간이 아니라 ‘보고 있는’ 세계일 뿐이다. 삼원법은 움직이는 관점을 다원적으로 가지고 있으며(산점투시), 그래서 ‘보아 가는’ 그림이다. 산은 계절, 시간, 시점 등에 따라 무수히 다양한 모습을 띤다. 상이한 시점이 얽혀 마치 감상자로 하여금 그 공간 속에 들어가 있는 것 같은 느낌을 주어야 한다. 그곳에 들어가 소요유할 수 있게 하기 위해서는 다시점의 관점에서 그 공간이 통일되는 것이 요구될 수밖에 없다. 그래서 삼원의 공간구성은 그곳에 들어와 있다는 현장감을 가지면서 산수의 공간에서 소요유하도록 하는 와유의 공간 구조를 갖게 한다. 삼원법은 또한 한정된 화면에 깊이있고 무한한 공간을 구현하기 위한 구도법이다. 산수의 공간은 하늘과 땅 사이의 공간을 말한다. 그 공간은 노자 에서 말하는 풀무와 같아서 움직여질수록 바람을 내보낼 뿐 고갈되지 않는다. 산수공간 개념은 우주공간 개념과 연계된다. 노자와 장자에서 보듯 산수화의 공간은 단순히 평면적인 것이 아니라 ‘무한 공간과 초월적 공간’에 해당된다. 이는 인간이 유위의 세계에 나오기 이전 무위자연의 근원적 상태를 상기시킨다. 우주의 원초적 기와 생동하는 기가 마찬가지로 화면에 구현되어야 한다. 안개와 구름으로 처리되는 빈 공간은 보이는 세계를 보이지 않는 세계에 연결하는 기에 의해 전파되는 공간이다. 우주에서와 같이 산수화에서도 빈 공간이 없다면 기는 순환할 수 없고, 음양도 작용할 수 없다. 삼원법은 단지 투시원근법만을 의미하는 것이 아니다. 화면 안에 정신적 공간을 구성하고, 이 정신적 공간을 통해 화면의 유한 공간을 벗어나 무한공간으로 진입하게 한다. 이 공간은 심재의 공간이 되어 세속의 먼지와 사심(私心)을 비우게 하며, 이어 무한의 근원공간으로 확대되면서 자신의 마음을 천지지심(天地之心)으로 확대시켜나갈 수 있게 한다.					0	0	0	0	0	1226-9727		KJD:ART001744573		
J	이지현								Imagining the Reinvention of Definitions :an Analysis of Lesson Plays			‘정의’의 재발명을 상상하다 : Lesson Play의 분석					School Mathematics	학교수학			15	4			667	682					2013	2013	Though teachers’ lesson plays, this article analysed teachers’ knowledge for mathematical teaching about mathematical definitions and their pedagogical difficulties in teaching defining. Although the participant teachers didn’t transmit definitions to students and suggested possible definitions of the given geometric figure in their imaginary lessons, they didn’t teach defining as deductive organization of properties of the geometric figure. They considered mathematical definition as a mere linguistic convention of a word, so they couldn’t appreciate the necessity of deductive organization in teaching definitions, and the arbitrary nature of mathematical definitions. Therefore, for learning to teach definitions differently, it is necessary for teachers to reflect the gap between the everyday and mathematical definitions in teachers’education.				이 연구에서는 도형 정의의 재발명에 대해 세 교사가 쓴 lesson play를 통하여, 교사들이 가지고 있었던 정의 개념과 연역적 조직화로서의 정의하기를 가르치고자 할 때 봉착했던 교수학적 문제들을 살펴보았다. 교사들은 lesson play에서 도형의 정의를 주입식으로 전달하지 않았으며 여러 다른 정의의 가능성을 제시하였으나, 연역적 조직화로서의 정의하기를 적극적으로 구현할 수는 없었다. 교사들은 정의를 어떤 용어에 대한 언어적 약속으로 생각하여, 정의를 가르치는 데 있어 연역적 조직화와 같은 과정이 왜 필요한지를 이해하지 못하였다. 또 수학적 정의의 임의성 및 정의와 정리의 지위가 절대적이지 않다는 사실을 수용하는 데에도 어려움을 겪고 있었다. 이와 같은 결과는 교사들이 도형의 수학적 정의를 자신이 배웠던 방식과 다르게 가르치도록 하기 위해서는, 교사교육에서 단순히 Freudenthal의 이론과 같은 이상적인 교수 방향 및 철학을 소개하는 것만으로는 부족하며, 상식적인 정의 개념과 수학적 정의 개념의 차이를 인식하고 반성해보는 것이 필요함을 보여주고 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-4322		KJD:ART001835763		
J	조재희								The Construction of Masculinity and   the Maternal Fantasies in Macbeth			맥베스 에 나타난 남성정체성과 모성환상					Shakespeare Review				49	2			321	342					2013	2013	The Construction of Masculinity and the Maternal Fantasies in Macbeth Abstract Jae-HeeCho This essay aims to explore the maternal fantasies which Macbeth depends on for the construction of his masculinity. The patriarchal male subject constitutes his masculinity in relation to a fantasized pre-oedipal maternal. Like most male subjects Macbeth also constructs his masculinity, going through the fantasy of escape from maternal matrix into patriarchal hierarchy. Witches’ prophecy, “None of woman born / shall harm Macbeth”makes Macbeth keep internalizing his psychological fantasy. In the battle of Macdonwald and Macbeth, Macbeth fights with Macdonwald allied with the tainting female, the whore Fortune in his fantasy so that he sustains masculinity. Macbeth manages in the fantasy of self-birth his own caesarian section, caving his passage out from Macdonwald, the imaginary female to achieve heroic male action. The destructive maternal fantasy and the fantasy of escape are also represented in the murder of Duncan and the encouragement of Lady Macbeth inducing the murder. Macbeth creates defensive fantasy, projecting the image of infantile vulnerability and maternal into Duncan. In addition, Macbeth projects the mother to infants sharing her hardness, born without vulnerability into Lady Macbeth then reconstitutes himself as the invulnerable male child of such a mother. However hard he tries to keep the fantasy, he is to fall into the dilemma that he can’t avoid the power of the man not born of woman, who is Macduff born by caesarian section. In conclusion, at the beginning, it seems that Macbeth becomes the bearer of the shared fantasy that secure male community depends on the prowess of the man not born of woman, the man who can carve his own passage out. But, at the end of the play, his death disproves that the masculinity is the mark of exemption from maternal origin and the vulnerability that are its consequence metaphorically.									0	0	0	0	0	1226-2668		KJD:ART001785640

Instead, nation defined as an imagined community, a term proposed by Benedict Anderson, began to take shape through complex negotiations among people who felt the need for a shared political identity while seeking to promote self-interests. Among the multiple factors that mediated the historical process, Englishness was most prominent. It served as a common anchorage in the development of a collective national identity. Analyzing Henry V and Sir Thomas More, this paper argues that Englishness was not a given political category but a mode of identification creating a fantasy of bond among scrappy individuals divided otherwise by the preexisting formulations of subjecthood, such as class, religion, ethnicity, places of origin, and so on. The most immediately available sources for creating a shared fantasy were found among common cultural practices, especially the ones involving food choices and eating habits. The “band of brothers” in Henry V and the rioters in Sir Thomas More are examined as showcases of the emerging national consciousness in Shakespeare’s time. The first suggests that the subject’s willing imaginary identification is the determining factor of a nation. The second envisions London as a civic body, a form of the national political order on a smaller scale, which is based on fraternal alliance among citizens.									0	0	0	0	0	1226-2668		KJD:ART001840158

J	박정호								Religious Origin of Utilitarianism: From ‘the Economy of Grace’ to ‘the Grace of Economy’			공리주의의 종교적 기원: 은총의 경제에서 경제의 은총으로					Society and Theory	사회와 이론			23				313	359					2013	2013	This paper explores the clue to the historical shift from ‘the economy of grace’ to ‘the grace of economy’ by reexamining the central theme of Max Weber’s The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. For this purpose, the imaginary notion of ‘gift of god’ serves as the conceptual framework for clarifying the sociological meaning of the grace. This historical shift is closely associated with a series of processes; deritualization, dematerialization and internalization of the notion of ‘the gift of god.’ To understand these processes, it is needed to examine how the protestant notion of God cultivated the ethos of asceticism in the minds of the faithful and how this ethos was eventually dissolved and reconstituted into utilitarian creed. However, such a change from the ascetic ethos to utilitarian creed disgruntles the foundation of the gift-relations between humans, whose meaning has ceaselessly been put to the test. From this perspective, this paper, firstly, compares the ‘magical’ gift of god and the ‘religious’ gift of God in order to illuminate the peculiar meaning structure of religious grace formed outside the magical environment. Secondly, it attempts to examine the notion of ‘the economy of grace’ formed in the context of christianity and to evaluate the value of ‘loving neighbors’(caritas), a typical secularized form of grace in the gift relations. Thirdly, it reconstructs Weber’s thesis on the affinity between Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism from the double aspects; the transformation of the meaning of ‘grace’ and a decline of the value of ‘loving neighbors.’ Finally, it elucidates how the protestant notion of ‘the gift of God’ has closely bound up with the spirit of the ascetic accumulation of goods and has eventually given birth to modern ‘Weltbild’ represented by utilitarianism.				이 글은 막스 베버의 프로테스탄티즘의 윤리와 자본주의 정신 의 중심 테마를 ‘신의 선물’이라는 상상의 관념이 겪었던 변화의 관점에서 재검토함으로써 ‘은총의 경제’에서 ‘경제의 은총’으로 넘어가는 이행의 실마리를 추적하고자 한다. 이 이행은 신의 선물이라는 관념의 탈의례화(deritualisation), 탈물질화(dematerialisation), 내면화(interiorisation)와 같은 일련의 과정과 깊이 연관되어 있다. 이 과정을 파악하기 위해서는 은총의 관념이 어떻게 인간의 깊은 내면에 개입해 현세적 금욕의 에토스를 키워내는가를 고찰하고 이 에토스가 어떻게 공리주의적 신념으로 용해되고 재구성되는가를 해명해야 한다. 그런데 신의 선물이라는 관념이 겪었던 이러한 변화 과정은 인간들 사이의 증여 행위의 전통적인 지평을 뒤흔들고, 그것을 끊임없이 시험대 위에 올려놓는다. 이러한 문제의식을 바탕으로 이 글은 첫째, ‘신의 선물’의 주술적 유형과 종교적 유형을 비교 고찰함으로써 주술적 환경의 바깥에서 형성되는 종교적 은총의 특수한 의미 구조를 논한다. 둘째, 기독교 신학의 맥락에서 형성된 ‘은총의 경제’라는 관념을 살펴보고, 이 관념을 따르는 세속적 증여의 전형적인 태도인 ‘이웃 사랑’의 가치를 논한다. 셋째, 베버가 해명한 ‘프로테스탄티즘의 윤리와 자본주의 정신’의 친화성을 ‘은총’ 관념의 변동과 ‘이웃 사랑’의 가치 쇠퇴라는 측면에서 고찰한다. 끝으로 프로테스탄티즘의 초월적 신이 제공한 은총이 어떻게 금욕적 재화 축적의 정신과 긴밀히 결부되어 마침내 공리주의로 대표되는 근대적 세계상을 잉태하게 되는가를 논한다.					0	0	0	0	0	1598-6500		KJD:ART001824342		
J	조석연								A Study of Phoenix as Symbol in Ancient Oriental Music			고대 동양 악(樂)에 나타나는 봉황의 상징성 연구					STUDIES IN KOREAN MUSIC	한국음악연구			54				395	414					2013	2013	Through a study into the close relation between ancient oriental music and Phoenix in eastern philosophy, this paper deals with Phoenix as symbol that appears in music. In ancient music-theory Phoenix was endowed with supernatural meaning and was held sacred. Phoenix symbol shown in the literature can be divided into two categories:As a symbol of the god of music and as a symbol of origin of 12律. The origin of 12律 that rules the melody as the fundamental principles of ancient philosophy was defined also due to the cry of Phoenix. The crying sound of Phoenix acquires absolute symbol character of god. Furthermore, it explains naturally the philosophical origin of yin-and-yang-theory. Phoenix, auspicious imaginary animal, hereby beyond logical and reasonable measure has retained ideological symbolic meaning of eastern philosophy, even. As ancient musical instrument which was modeled on the figure of Phoenix, there are Bongso and Saenghwang. But this Bongso means current Baeso, and according to many ancient literatures and archeological specimens it can be seen that Bongso expresses not merely outward appearance of Phoenix. It demonstrates also the symbolism of Phoenix. Meanwhile, Saenghwang is musical instrument that shows the will of the Creator, to create a finished Music, by means of the visual imitation of Phoenix. Phoenix patterns that appeared in Korean ancient instruments indicate Phoenix’s primitive symbol as absolute god of music and Eastern philosophy based on yin-and- yang-theory. Moreover, Phoenix patterns show ingenious meaning that was only in Korea granted. In this sense we can say that both Phoenix’s head decoration of Sugonghu (vertical harp) engraved on the bell of Sangwonsa and Phoenix pattern of Silla-Geum (Silla zither) show the unique form of ancient Korea and general symbol system of Phoenix in Northeast Asia.				본 논문은 동양 사상 속에 등장하는 음악과 봉황과의 밀접한 관련을 통하여 음악에서 드러나는 봉황의 상징성을 살핀 글이다. 고대 악론에 등장하는 봉황은 초자연적인 의미를 부여하여 신성시되었다. 문헌에 보이는 봉황의 상징은 크게 음악의 신으로서의 상징과 12율 발원으로서의 상징으로 나눠 볼 수 있다. 고대사상의 기본 법칙인 음률을 결정짓는 12율 발원도 봉황의 울음소리에 기인하여 정하였다. 봉황의 울음소리는 신으로서의 절대 상징성뿐 아니라 사상적 근원인 음양론을 자연스럽게 설명하고 자연계의 섭리에 의한 음양의 순환사상까지 부여하였다. 이로써 상상 속에 존재하는 상서로운 동물인 봉황은 논증적, 합리적 척도를 뛰어넘어 동양 사상의 관념론적 상징 의미까지도 갖는다. 고대 악기 중에는 봉황의 모습을 본떠 만든 악기로 봉소와 생황이 있다. 봉소는 현재 배소를 가리키며 고대 문헌과 고고학 자료에 의해 단순한 봉황 형태를 본떠 만든 것에 그치지 않고 봉황이 갖는 상징성을 표명하고 있음을 알 수 있다. 생황은 악의 신인 봉황의 형상을 본뜸으로써 인하여 고차원적 음률과 ‘완성된 악’을 만들고자 하는 조물주의 의지와 생동성의 상징성을 가지고 있는 악기이다. 한국고대악기에서 등장하는 봉황문양은 봉황이 가지고 있는 절대 악신으로서의 원시적 상징과 음양론의 동양 사상을 바탕으로 하고 있는 동시에 한국에서만의 독창적인 의미부여를 하고 있는 특징을 가지고 있다. 상원사 범종에 새겨진 수공후의 봉수장식과 신라금 봉황문양 모두 고대 한국이 가지고 있는 독특한 양식에서 변모한 봉황의 틀에서 제작된 형태인 동시에, 봉황이 가지고 있는 동북아의 상징체계를 함께 공유하고 있는 요소라 할 수 있을 것이다.					0	0	0	0	0	1975-4604		KJD:ART001831188		
J	신영헌								“A Psychoanalyst Reading of William Faulkner’s “Knight’s Gambit”			체스와 정신분석: 윌리엄 포크너의 ｢기사의 첫 수｣ (“Knight’s Gambit”)를 읽는 두 개의 키워드					Studies in Modern Fiction	현대영미소설			20	3			465	488					2013	2013	William Faulkner’s “Knight’s Gambit” is a novella which depicts the way Gavin Stevens tries to prevent a family tragedy from taking place. In return for his role, he succeeds in marrying his first love, Melisandre Backus. The story begins with a scene where Gavin and his nephew are playing a chess game. Chess is the most important motif in the story and contributes to enriching the meaning of the text. In the fiction, Max Harriss, Melisandre’s spoiled son attempts to kill his would-be father Sabastian Gualdres because Gualdres courts his mother and his sister at the same time. However, Gavin finds out his plan in advance and prevents it from being put into practice. He urges Max to enlist in the army. Max cannot but obey his demand. Gavin is able to marry Melisandre with no interference. In this sense, the title of the novella comprehensively accounts for the plot. Knight’s gambit, a chess term refers to the move of the Knight which sacrifices the Pawn to rapidly develop his own forces. Gavin discards his Pawns like Max and Gauldres in order to capture the opponent’s Queen, Melisandre. Chess is also closely related with psychoanalysis in that it aims to checkmate or capture the king symbolizing the father. Patricide or the desire to kill and replace one’s own father is the basic motif of the psychoanalytic theory posited by Sigmund Freud. In terms of Lacan’s theory, Gavin, the county attorney of Yoknapatawpha is playing the role of the symbolic father when he tells Max to enlist, which can be compared to spiritual castration. Max enters the Symbolic by accepting Gavin’s demand. At this moment, the imaginary ego becomes the symbolic subject. In other words, the fictional “I” becomes the true “I”. In conclusion, the psychoanalytic theory of Freud and Lacan adds to the depth and meaning of the story.									0	0	0	0	0	1229-7232		KJD:ART001837620		
J	Na, Jongseok								Korea’s Democracy and Confucian Culture			한국 민주주의와 유교문화					The Catholic Philosophy	가톨릭철학			21				219	250					2013	2013	The thesis will observe the positive relationship between democracy and Confucianism by focusing on the positive impact Confucian traditions had on Korea’s democratization process. From this perspective, the thesis will refute the common misperception that Confucian values are only feudalistic, anti-modern and critical barriers to pursuing modernity. This misperception is dominant in regards to Joseon Confucianism and especially Joseon Neo-Confucianism,due to the history of Joseon Dynasty’s demise from the shock of opening to the West and the Japanese colonial era that ensued. This thesis will challenge that prevalent misperception. The thesis will elaborate on the positive roles that Confucian political culture, which was established throughout Joseon Dynasty, played on the development of Korea’s democracy. Here, the thesis defines Korea’s democracy as Seonbi(士)Democracy, and explains the internal dynamics of Korea’s democratization movement as a process of creative merger between Seonbi Spirit and democracy. Also, the thesis will look at how Confucian traditions changed due to the shock of opening to the West, and considers the democratization of the chung(loyalty, 忠). The thesis is also an effort to produce a Korean theory of democracy, which is non-existent at present. The thesis aims to identify unique qualities of Korea’s modernity by establishing an independent theory of Korea’s democratization. The author believes the symbiotic relationship between Confucian culture and democracy show the distinct qualities of Korean modernity				이 글에서 필자는 민주주의와 유교문화 사이에 긍정적인 연관이있다는 점을 한국 민주화 과정에서 유교적 전통이 끼친 긍정적 영향을 중심으로 살펴보고자 한다. 이 논제를 통해 이 글에서 비판하고자 하는 관점은 유교적 가치는 오로지 봉건적이고 반(anti)근대적이어서 근대성을 추구하는 데 결정적인 방애물이라는 통념이다. 이 통념은 한국사회에 국한해보아도 서구의 충격으로 인해 조선왕조가 멸망하고 일본 제국주의의 식민지로 전락한 경험으로 인해 지금까지 조선 유학, 특히 조선 주자학을 바라보는 주류적 관점이다. 이 글은 이런 주류적 관점에 대한 도전이다. 이 글에서 필자는한국의 민주주의의 실현 과정에서 조선시대를 거치면서 축적되어온 유교적 정치문화가 어떤 방식으로 긍정적인 역할을 수행했는지를 보여주고자 한다. 이 글에서 필자는 한국의 민주주의를 선비민주주의로 규정하고 선비정신과 민주주의의 창조적 만남의 과정을통해 민주화 운동의 내적 논리를 해명하고자 한다. 또한 이 글은유교적 전통이 서구의 충격을 통해 변형되는 과정을 충(忠)관념의민주적 변형이라는 시각에서 고찰한다. 이를 통해 유교적 정치전통의 민주적 잠재력이 한국사회에서 어떤 방식으로 구현되는가를보여준다. 이 연구는 아직도 제대로 된 한국 민주주의론이 없는 학문적 공백을 채워보기 위한 시도이기도 하다. 한국의 민주주의의 실현 과정에 대한 독자적 논리에 대한 이해를 통해 궁극적으로 해명하려는 과제는 한국적 근대성의 고유한 성격이다. 유교문화와 민주화의 상생적 만남이 바로 한국 근대성의 독자적 성격을 보여주고 있다고 보기 때문이다.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-2915		KJD:ART001814720

But, the understanding and study trend about the space of the academic world is pointing of merely the stage shaping and the core subject of staging courses for this and at methodical sides. This is revealed the limits at the point of interest expression for the only small part of space-theory discussion surrounding drama text. Although we consider that the stage space makes the first point of contact of a good understanding with audience, this needs reflection. This study was arranged the past discussion surrounded with the space of drama (chapter1). Based on this, it was studied that shape it would be tasting interpretation about the concrete individual works(chapter2). But understanding the space in this way has a limit that it doesn't get a deep interpretation on that work through the understanding of space reflecting in the literary work. Therefore, it was introduced the achievement of human geography and critical geography lately (chapter3) through this by researching how space idea produced socially showed the reality revealing in the work and human life, it tried to show that it could be reached a new work understanding (chapter3)Through the achievement of this study, it is trying to emphasize that the past methodology can be contributed steadily for the imaginary reading of works and for staging.

J	Seo, Youngin								Pro-Japanese Imperialist Literature of Jung, In-taek in the late Japanese Imperialism and Manchuria On-site Inspection  : Ideological Interpellation of National Policy and Response			일제 말기 정인택의 친일협력문학과 만주 시찰체험 ―국책 이데올로기의 호명과 그 수용과정을 중심으로					THE JOUNAL OF LITERARY THEORY	현대문학이론연구			53				201	222					2013	2013	This essay scrutinizes literary works of Jung, In-taek, who is notorious as a pro-Japanese Imperialist writer, focusing on the motive of Manchuria on-site Inspection. The inspection means subsumption into the ideology of national policy and the result of response to the interpellation of the ideology led him to accept the policy. His two works, “Black Soil and White Face” and “Dense Fog”, which were written based on the inspection, show how ideological discipline draws the voluntary cooperation of the writer. While the former work makes pure imaginary space from Manchuria revealing its problems of frequent closures, the latter links narrative of Manchuria colonization with ideology of ‘Hwangkuksinmin’ reproducing something beyond the ideology. Transcending Manchuria discourse of representation and placation of “Exploiting Spirit of Hope and Summon”, “Dense Fog” make rebirth of Manchuria as a sacred war-space. Through the idea and works of Jung, In-taek, we can examine how colonial power transforms the colonized into the “national subject” by the ideological apparatus.				이 글에서는 만주 시찰을 모티브로 하여 일제 말기 대표적인 친일 협력 문학자 정인택의 작품세계를 해명해 보고자 했다. 만주시찰은 국책 이데올로기를 내세우는 제도적 포섭에 해당했고 정인택은 이 이데올로기적 호명에 응답하면서 국책을 받아들이기 시작했다고 볼 수 있다. 만주 시찰 경험을 기반으로 창작된 두 작품 ｢검은 흙과 흰 얼굴｣과 ｢농무｣를 통해 이데올로기적 훈육이 어떻게 작가의 자발적 협력을 이끌어내는가를 확인해 볼 수 있다. ｢검은 흙과 흰 얼굴｣이 만주 시찰 보고에서 보여주었던 폐쇄성의 문제를 거듭 노출하면서 작가의 상상적 공간만으로 구축된 만주의 이미지를 만들어낸다면, ｢농무｣는 만주 개척의 서사를 황국신민의 이데올로기와 연결시키면서 이데올로기가 지시하지 않은 것까지 재생산해 낸다. ｢농무｣는 ‘희망과 소명의 개척정신’의 재현과 선무(宣撫)라는 만주 담론의 지배 이데올로기를 초월하면서 만주를 더욱 신성한 전시(戰時)공간으로 재탄생시킨다. 정인택을 통해 우리는 어떻게 식민권력이 이데올로기적 장치를 통해 지배 이데올로기를 유포하고 식민지인들을 ‘국민적 주체’로 변신시키는가를 살펴볼 수 있었다.					0	0	0	0	0	1598-124X		KJD:ART001783811		
J	Jung, Yeonsik								Anxiety and Immunity			불안과 면역					The Journal of Criticism and Theory	비평과이론			18	2			141	159					2013	2013	Sigmund Freud’s theory of anxiety, particularly of “neurotic anxiety,” as an elusive affect related to the indeterminacy of object suggests the creativity of anxiety through which the ego imagines the object of fear or “realistic anxiety.” As a response to the impossible threat to the unity of the ego, neurotic anxiety serves as a unique symptom of the human being that discloses the imaginary structure of the ego. Yann Martel’s Life of Pi(2001) provides an effective parable of creative anxiety, in which the protagonist imagines a Bengal tiger as a companion and foe, a virtual threat that keeps him alive. The imagined, life-preserving object of fear, as manifested also in Freud’s case study of Little Hans who fears being bitten by a horse, indicates the reality principle governing the dynamics of anxiety. The ways in which the anxious subject preconceives the object of fear, evades it, and contains it as a way to maintain its subjectivity construct the defensive mechanism of anxiety, which shares a common ground with that of the immune system. Immunity can be acquired through the antigen-antibody reaction, in which antibodies register pathogens, exterminates them, and incorporates their trace as the part of a body. Roberto Esposito’s definition of immunity as the simultaneous protection and negation of life not only reveals the paradoxical nature of immunization, which requires an element of heterogeneity in order to maintain the homogeneity of life, but also sheds light on the dialectical dynamics of anxiety hinged on a threat to subjectivity. Following the reality principle, anxiety and the immune system contradictorily perform the inclusion and exclusion, respectively, of a fear-object and an antigen, which function as pharmakon, as both remedy and poison, that maintains the homeostasis of the ego and life.									0	0	0	0	0	1598-9089		KJD:ART001832338

The early Chinese Americans needed to hold on to diasporic imagination, called national imaginary. While doing so, their subjectivities were represented as the subjectivity searching for the American dream or returning to the home country. Paper Angels shows how their both of two Chinese and American identities are influenced in their immigrant life in Angel Island, which is neither China nor America, and how their Chinese American subjectivity is constructed.									0	0	0	0	0	2005-5862		KJD:ART001831263		
J	Amiran, Eyal								Occupy Publishing: A Postcard to the Peer-Review Imaginary								The Journal of English Language and Literature	영어영문학			59	3			457	465					2013	2013	Peer-reviewed publishing is the gold standard of academic integrity,but it is not itself an integral process. Different kinds of practices and procedures in the publishing world pass for peer-review and so serve legitimizing functions for scholarship. On the one hand, this has led to a kleptocracy in which established scholars cash in on their (often deserved)establishmentarianism. On the other, it has allowed the proliferation of new kinds of publication that operate outside established cultural institutions like university presses, yet also serve legitimizing functions. These new forms of publication deconstruct the authority of institutional publishing and enable new ways of defining and occupying the interstices of public culture. More recently, even as traditional print journals have been slow to move to born-digital publishing (making do with PDF versions of their print pages, posted on the web), many new journals have formed on the web, often without regular press sponsorship. These journals, such as N+1,Southern Spaces and nonsite.org, offer the opportunity of publishing shorter and less scholarly pieces, like travel essays and commentary, in a context that offers the legitimacy of peer review. They have large editorial boards and list their credentials prominently. In so doing, they help heretofore minor forms of writing get credit, and also help conventional academic work move away from past institutional boundaries.									0	0	0	0	0	1016-2283		KJD:ART001787067

More specifically, this essay closely analyzes how Shadrack andSula, who are considered social outcasts, build up a counter-culturalspace and achieves freedom and the sense of agency right in the middleof oppressive ground. The first part examines how Shadrack in Sula, ashell-shocked veteran, subtly makes resistant gestures taking advantageof his insanity as a way to excuse his abnormal behaviors. In the novel,Shadrack regresses to the non-verbal space or the imaginary dimensionin Lacanian term in the process of reclaiming his sense of identity. However, Shadrack’s regression to the non-verbal space helps him tounlearn not only his cultural knowledge but also the negativity of hisblack identity. And more significantly, Shadrack’s ability to unlearn thesocial norms empowers him to constitute a National Suicide Day thateventually serves as a counter cultural space for black people. The secondpart of this essay discusses Sula’s queer identity. Morrison describesSula as a character that eludes all the categorical identities. This essayexamines how Morrison envisions a true sense of freedom through Sula’squeer identity nullifying the moral, racial, and sexual borderlines.									0	0	0	0	0	1016-2283		KJD:ART001844548

This study was conducted with 44 male young children and 46 female young children, 90 children in total. To measure young children's cognitive ability, the language and intelligence test method of Yeong-hee Ju(1982) was adopted, and to measure young children's creativity, the young children's diagram-based creativity test method of Gyeong-won Jeon(2001) was used. To analyze young children's imaginary narrative structure, the imaginative narrative structure analysis criteria of Yeong-ja Lee and Ji-hyeon Lee(2005) was used. The data gathered were analyzed for verification of the hypothesis by using SPSS. To grasp the individual changing patterns of the storytelling among young children of 48 to 64 months, the lineal growth model was analyzed. The findings were as follows: First, It turned out that the storytelling abilities of young children's were enhanced over time. The initial values and the rates of changes in terms of storytelling abilities were different among individual young children. Second, it turned out that the young children's cognitive ability and the creativity had positive effects on the initial values and some rate of changes in storytelling abilities. Thus, the higher the cognitive ability and creativity of young children are, the higher the level of young children's storytelling abilities are.				이 연구에서는 이야기꾸미기 능력과 관련하여 종단 자료를 이용하여 유아의 이야기꾸미기 능력의 개인별 변화양상과 개인차가 존재하는지를 알아보는데 목적을 두었다. 또한 유아의 인지능력과 창의성이 이야기 꾸미기 능력에 어떤 영향을 미치는지를 알아보고자 하였다. 본 연구의 대상은 남아 44명, 여아 46명, 총 90명이었다. 유아의 인지능력은 주영희(1982)의 언어 및 사고능력 검사를 이용하여 측정하였고, 유아의 창의성을 측정하기 위하여 전경원(2001)의 유아 도형 창의성 검사를, 이야기꾸미기 능력을 측정하기 위하여 채미영(2003)의 이야기꾸미기 능력 평가 도구를 사용하여 측정하였다. 48개월부터 64개월까지 유아의 이야기꾸미기 능력의 개인별 변화양상을 파악하기 위해 선형적 성장모형 분석을 실시하였다. 연구 결과는 다음과 같다. 첫째, 유아의 월령이 높아질수록 이야기꾸미기 능력의 하위 요소인 이야기 구조 개념, 상상력, 언어능력의 개인별 변화양상은 높아지는 경향이 있었다. 또한 유아의 이야기 구조 개념과 상상력의 경우는 초기값과 변화율 모두 개인 간에 차이가 있는 것으로 나타났고, 유아의 언어능력(어휘력과 문장력)의 경우는 초기값에만 개인 간에 차이가 있는 것으로 나타났다. 둘째, 유아의 인지능력과 창의성은 유아의 이야기꾸미기 능력의 모든 하위 요소의 초기값에 영향을 미치는 것으로 나타났다. 또한 유아의 인지능력은 유아의 이야기 구조 개념과 상상력의 변화율에도 긍정적인 영향을 미치는 것으로 나타났다.					0	0	0	0	0	1226-8119		KJD:ART001763918		
J	노춘기											1930년대 황석우 시의 정치성과 탈정치성- ≪영화시대≫, ≪계명시보≫ 수록 작품을 중심으로 -|Study on the poetical works of Hwang–Sokwoo in the 1930’s magazines.					The Journal of Korean Studies	한국학연구			47				215	239					2013	2013	The objects of this article are analyzing the poetical works of Hwang–Sokwoo in the magazines of YeongHwaSiDae and KyeMyungSiBo and understanding the poems of his middle works on the logic of his poetic attitude in 1930’s. In his early works, Hwang argued that the essence of poetry is the severance of relation with everyday language and the resistance to conventional standard is the staring point of the modern poetry. Especially his argument of that the emotion is not the object of control but the object of serious attention. In his middle works, he showed remarkable change of poetic words and methods of speaking as ‘Nature Poetry’. In 1930’s works, he focused not on individual but on public, not on the problem of inner side of private person but on the problem of reception of social reality. The Nature in ‘nature poetry’ meant imaginary reality as alternative of real world in the voretex of worldwar and colonization. Continuously, Hwang proposed the new way of accepting the real world by idealized images and symbols of the Nature based on the concept of utopianism and anarchism. The aesthetic attitude of Hwang was different from the Nationalism and Socialism of the 1920’s korean poetic trends.				이 논문은 기존의 연구에서 언급되지 않았던 『映畵時代』와 『啓明時報』 소재의 작품 23편을 중심으로 황석우의 1932년 무렵과 공백기 이후 1938년 무렵의 시적 지향과 전략을 검토하였다. 이 작품들은 황석우 시세계에서 중기시의 의미를 보다 확장하여 이해할 수 있는 1930년대의 자료이며, 작품 연보에서 공백기를 단축하고 황석우라는 문화적 현상의 복합성을 이해할 자료라는 점에서 충분한 의의를 갖는 것으로 판단되었다. ‘자연시’ 계열의 작품들은 자연에 대한 미적 감각을 환기시키는 소박한 미적 계몽의 목적에 부합하는 측면이 있었으며, 현실적 고통을 소거한 채 묘사되는 탈역사적이고 탈현실적인 유토피아는 비루하고 잔혹한 현실에 대한 소극적인 부정의식을 역설적으로 전제하고 있었다. 그리고 명시적인 사상성과 정치성을 노출하고 있는 ‘사상시’ 계열의 작품들에서 황석우는 그 소재적 측면에서는 검열에 의해 삭제되지 않은 것이 의아할 정도로 강한 표현들이 보이지만, 적대적인 대결의지나 투쟁의 선동적 표현을 구체적으로 내세우고 있지는 않았다. 1930년대의 이들 작품들을 볼 때 황석우에게 혁명가로서의 자의식은 그의 정치적 언표에서뿐만 아니라 탈정치적 언표에서도 흔들리지 않는 구심점을 형성하고 있었다. 1930년대의 황석우는 사상적 근거였던 아나키즘의 유토피아적 성격으로부터 출발하여 사회주의적이면서도 일종의 이상주의로서 KAPF류의 전략과 구별되며, 1910년대의 신체시가류의 계몽적 문학과도, 1920년대의 국민문학파의 시조나 민요조 시와도 구별되는 독자적인 문화운동의 영역을 개척해 나가고 있었다.					0	0	0	0	0	1225-195x		KJD:ART001840404

J	황정현								The Making of Korean Modernity: Gender, Nation and Korean Realism in The Stray Bullet								The Journal of Literature and Film	문학과 영상			14	3			885	911					2013	2013	By analyzing Yu Hyeon-mok’s 1961 film The Stray Bullet, in the context of South Korean “Golden Age” films from the 1950s and early 1960s, this essay explores the ways in which popular imaginaries were enacted, probed, and recast in the emergent yet divided nation caught in-between tradition and modernity. Yu’s film illustrates the making of modern Korea as an allegorical process of constructing Korean modernity and gendered nationalism. It attempts to re-masculinize the nationalist subject/national cinema of realism at the expense of the female other/feminized genre of melodrama. In this dual terrain of Korean modernity and Korean realism, gendered nationalism is deployed as a discursive strategy to resolve contradictionsthe ambivalent stance toward modernity vis-a-vis tradition, and ultimately to be integrated into the global project of modernization.									0	0	0	0	0	1229-9847		KJD:ART001810962

Gilman describes the development of women’s suffrage movement through sisterhood in her three short stories which were written in five year intervals. In “Yellow Wall-Paper”, the narrator is unsuccessful in fostering female solidarity in the social and domestic spheres. However, through her persistence in seeking sisterhood, she finally succeeds in establishing sisterhood with the imaginary women trapped in the wallpaper. Encouraged by sisterhood with the imaginary women, the narrator creeps over her husband in the final scene which is the first courageous step towards women’s liberation in real life. “Five Girls” does not have any conflict or dramatic reversal to form sisterhood. It creates a model for women to ascertain a comfortable residence and live a happy life. In “Turned”, when Mrs. Marroner realizes that Gerta, the young maid, did not commit the crime but got afflicted with the crime of her husband, she decides to leave her husband and take care of Gerta and her baby. These two women, Mrs. Marroner and Gerta, upon exchanging respect and protection for each other, are united through strong sisterhood. Gilman, in her purposeful short stories, highlights the concept of sisterhood as a powerful and rebellious tool to emancipate women from patriarchy in the feminist context.

J	임세화								Growth and Aporia of the Young : Focusing on Son, Chang-Seop’s The Road			청년의 성장과 젊음의 모순- 손창섭의 길 을 중심으로					The Journal of Modern Korean Literature	한국현대문학연구			41				495	532					2013	2013	This study was willing to consider the meaning of Sung-Chil’s man formation and (im)possiblity of self growth shown in the road, a novel written by Son, Chang-Seop in 1960’s. The protagonist of this novel was the young man that want to answer the question what did the world demand to him. The city, Seoul was of special significance to him as the space of self-formation. He was a self-formative subject in ‘animal city’ as Seoul and was becoming an ascetic subject by learned protestant ethic. In a course of the search for the authentic self, he was confronted with the aporia of the young. It was caused by finding real himself and non-himself simultaneously. And it was the tragedy of the young man, Sung-Chil that grew up with losses of a homeland, a childhood and a mother. Historically, his dreams for the future were related with the inconsistency or disruption of the modern society. Especially the socialization of an individual as the imaginary solution of Biludungsroman was nonvalidated in the Korean novel 1960's. Sung-Chil's desire and adventure to social adjustment was a sign and the identity of himself presented bourgeois ethics. He as a self-contradict subject was tied up by the sign and identity. In the adventure for self-creation, Sung-Chil as a modern individual explicitly used a desire mediated by the social as the instrument of the search for the self and practiced self-denial to the purpose. His process of the socialization was not to be identified himself ordinary social way of life. But it was to be freaky socialization learned a way of accumulate wealth. Therefore Sung-Chil's authentic 'I' was interested in worldly success. It was a mimetic desire mediated by modern society. And his desire was never satisfied. In here, the young man's tragedy started. It was also the tragedy of the search for the self when it was completed, lost all of I. Finally, Sung-Chil's adventure in 1960's Seoul, was not only a report on the ugliness of the social reality and condition, but also Korean version of a form western novel. An inconsistency or disruption of the modern society and a continual pointing of future was represented in the novelistic form in the West and 1960's Korea.				이 글은 ‘세속이 나에게 무엇을 요구하는가’를 빠르게 알고 습득해나가는 청년 성칠을 통해 1960년대 손창섭의 장편소설 길 에 나타나는 ‘인간의 형성’과 ‘성장’ (불)가능성의 의미에 대해 살펴보았다. 고향을 버리고 서울이라는 공간에서 자아상을 구축해나가는 성칠에게 도시는 ‘자기 형성’의 공간으로서 중요한 의미를 갖는다. 서울이라는 ‘동물도회’ 속의 주체로 스스로를 자리매김하는 성칠은 프로테스탄티즘의 윤리를 체득하고 더 큰 욕망의 획득을 위해 욕망의 실현을 끝없이 유예하며 금욕하는 인물이다. ‘진정한 나’를 찾아가는 이 여행길에서 성칠은 온전한 ‘나’와 ‘나’ 아닌 것을 동시에 추구해야 하는 젊음의 모순과 맞닥뜨리게 된다. 그것은 성장의 기점에서 모든 것(고향, 유년, 어머니 등)을 상실할 수밖에 없음에도 불구하고, 그 불행을 감수하며 성장하기를 원하는 젊음의 비극이기도 하다. 성칠에게 주어진 수많은 가능성들은 그로 하여금 미래만을 꿈꾸게 하는데, 그것은 근대세계 자체가 지닌 모순, 분열과 맞닿아 있다. 근대 유럽의 ‘교양소설’이 개인의 사회화라는 문제에 해결책을 제시해주던 ‘상상적인 해법’은 1960년대의 한국에서도 더 이상 유효하지 않은 방식이 되어버렸다. ‘욕망’은 성칠을 사회에 복속시키고 길들이는데, 그것은 간접화된 부르주아적 윤리를 체현해내는 하나의 지표이자 그 자신의 정체성으로서, 모순적인 ‘자율적 주체’ 성칠을 점점 포박하게 된다. 명백히 근대적인 인물인 성칠은 자아 창조의 모험 속에서 사회가 매개한 욕망을 ‘자기 찾기’의 수단으로 삼고 그를 위해 금욕한다. 그러나 그의 사회화는 사회의 보편적인 삶의 방식을 자신의 것으로 동일화하는 하나의 학습이라기보다, ‘돈’을 벌기 위한 한 방편으로써의 편입이라는 점에서 대단히 기형적이다. 성칠이 찾는 ‘진정한 나’, 그가 추구하는 성공의 상이란 근대 사회가 매개한 간접화된 욕망이고, 이 근대적 인간의 이상은 결코 충족될 수 없다는 점에서 청년의 비극은 시작된다. 그것은 자신을 찾는 여행이 완성되는 순간 모든 것을 상실하게 되는 ‘자기 찾기’의 비극이기도 하다. 1960년대 서울이라는 공간에 던져진 청년 성칠의 ‘자기 찾기’의 도정은 단지 더럽고 추잡한 현실 세태의 고발과 비판을 위한 것만은 아니었다. 오히려 그것은 끝없이 가능성과 미래만을 꿈꾸게 하는 근대세계 자체가 지닌 모순과 분열에 맞닿아 있는 근대소설의 한 형식(form)의 변형에 가까운 한국적 판본이었다.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-2052		KJD:ART001842260

That view rejects the supposition that the only one real world exists and suggests that the real world coexist with the unreal or the imaginary. Slavoj Zizek developed the thinking, saying that the real world is just 'empty space' and that the function of the matrix is to cover up the contradiction of the real 'empty space'. Thus, a subject can be located neither in the real nor in the imaginary but in the 'empty space'. That means a subject should appropriate the space which he or she is alienated from and then only becomes a real subject.Can a human being, as the subject of body combined with almighty machines, in the matrix of many relations be in the place where he or she thinks he or she is?The reality the subject should become aware of is not inside nor outside of the matrix but the 'empty space'. Furthermore, a human being can not be a real subject until he or she recognizes his or her absence with the impotent position in the 'empty space'.									0	0	0	0	0	2005-1239		KJD:ART001769328		
J	陳明柔								Images of the Injured: The Intellectuals’ Psychological Dilemma in Taiwan Fictions during Japanese Colonial Period			負傷者的身影──日治時期台灣小說中知識分子的心理困境與疏離					The Journal of Study on Language and Culture of Korea and China	한중언어문화연구			33				553	580					2013	2013	This paper focuses on Taiwanese intellectuals’ psychological dilemma and their sense of alienation in the fictions. During Japanese colonial period, Taiwanese intellectuals had spiritually burdened with the identities both as an illuminator and the colonized when they started to appear in that specific era. On one hand, the colony status is the reality that they cannot avoid; on the other, as they are stimulated by the world view and value formed by modern education and the ideological trend of their time, they inevitably have to break up with the tradition and fight against the colonial ideology with their newly formed modern identity. They are simultaneously the pioneers and the reformers of the Taiwanese modern culture but are also trapped powerlessly within the colonized identity, perceiving sense of alienation for being the colonized. At the beginning, most of the fictions which are given the responsibility of enlightening during the colonial era often carry the theme of criticizing the injustice of the colonial society and the theme of the hopeless agony of the colonized in realist style. As a result, the main characters in the texts are usually different from the stereotypical activist’s images praised by the intellectuals, but they are often the prototype characters of frustration in both ideal and material aspects. The utopian ideal they eagerly pursue has never been realized. What they really burden is the historical trauma and destiny, and also the tragedy of being lost in the colonial reality. Such psychological dilemma embodied in the texts becomes the typical “superfluous man” who cannot fit into the family and society in reality, while alienating themselves spiritually. In these characters we could find that after the disillusionment of idealism, the petit intellectuals who suffer from the precocious colonial capitalism, face the bitterness and the lure of urban life alone, and objectify themselves in the material worlds, forming self-contradictory sense of alienation and psychological dilemma. The images of the injured are often the combination of the colony’s tragic destiny and the failure of realizing the ideal of socialism or individualism. Through the imaginary texts, the authors are able to represent the collective disillusionment of ideality and able to represent how the structure of feeling that has been gradually reformed along with the colonial modernization carries new values. In the structure of feeling constructed under such leaping-forward colonial capitalism, as the elites of Taiwan society, these colonial intellectuals have attached their own images on to the characters in the fictions and thrust to represent the strait, trauma and inability of these characters, and furthermore, to reflect the powerless colonial reality with the dispirited petit bourgeois’ personal consciousness.									0	0	0	0	0	1738-0502		KJD:ART001817251		
J	박난영								A Study of Bajin’s Religious View Based on His Works of Gods, Ghosts and Men			《신․귀신․인간(神․鬼․人)》을 통해 본 巴金의 종교관					The journal of the research of chinese novels	중국소설논총			40				187	208					2013	2013	This paper explores the significance of Buddhism in Japan by looking into the life of the real life figure that became the model for the protagonist in Gods and Ghosts. Moreover, it examines the Bajin’s view of religion reflected in Ghosts which was written based on his experience in a detention center on Japanese grounds. In his work Gods, the author portrays the process of a good-natured intellectual, Hasegawa, turning into a Buddhist from being an atheist. The death of Hasegawa was also depicted as spiritual rather than physical. Although the author saw the conversion of Hasegawa, who was once respected worldwide for his knowledge of culture, into a devout Buddhist studying Buddhist scriptures all night as an act of escaping reality, the actual model for the figure, Takeda, took it a step further by spearheading the Japanese invasion of China. In Ghosts, Horiguchi feels that resisting one’s destiny is foolish after being separated from his lover Mitsuko by his family’s fierce opposition. After getting married by arrangement, he soughs to heal his wounded spirit in nirvana – a world of ghosts. He saw that everything was related to the law that one reaps what one has sown and considered that there is always a cause and effect for the good, evil, joys and sorrows of human life. He thereby tries to work out his own salvation through reading Buddhist scriptures all day, chanting prayers, and offering sacrifices to the sea. Eventually, Mitsuko dies a miserable death while Horiguchi depends on ghosts and offer sacrifices to them at the sea for the rest of his life. The social atmosphere in Japan at the time can be best represented by ‘conversion’, which could be seen as relevant to why the protagonist, who once had progressive views of the world, converted to Buddhism and became passive in life. Men is a piece inspired from Bajin’s experience in a Japanese detention center for the reason of having rebellious idea by the Japanese government in an attempt to prevent any possible hazard before Manzhouguo emperor Pu-yi’s visit to Japan. Most of the inmates appearing in Men were detained because of poverty and barely madea living under the harsh circumstances of hunger, abusive language, and violence. Criticism of Christianity by anarchists is mainly focused on denying a transcendental authority such as god interfering with the life of humans. The criticism was a rebellion and a refuse to obey God as an ideology and as a deception of the mind. Bajin points out that the power of human is stronger than the vain power of God. Rooted from the idea that religious alienation of individuals has resulted into forming a dual world of religious fantasy and the reality, he further emphasizes that the religious sphere has to return to the mundane world Bajin’s most basic perception of the world is that the power of human is greater than an imaginary god regardless of the era. His criticisms of religion are connected to his criticisms of the old system dependent on religion for its survival. He seeks to transform the people living like slaves under abuse through his criticisms. Bajin’s atheism ultimately strives toward establishing humanitarianism and individualism that prioritize human while opposing feudalism in order to build a world based on freedom and equality.									0	0	0	0	0	1225-9624		KJD:ART001794049		
J	Joo, Bong-Ho								An Exploratory Study of the Direction and Contents of the East Asian Community			동아시아공동체의 내용과 방향 모색					The Korean Civic Ethics Society	한국시민윤리학회보			26	2			93	124					2013	2013	‘East Asia’ and ‘East Asian Regionalism’ and the East Asian ‘Community’ and ‘Identity’ have received substantial recognitions as a topic for debates from both the inside and outside of the Korean scholarly society. The early debate had been mainly about how to define East Asia from the standpoint of humanities studies such as literature, history, and philosophy, but from the late 1990s, especially among social scientists specializing the development studies, the focus of the topic has been shifted to the particularity and identity of East Asia. In that regard, economists and political scientists have raised the necessity of economic community and security community. For a comprehensive investigation of East Asian regional community, it is necessary to take interdisciplinary imaginary beyond academic parochialism. This is especially for the case of mutually shared fundamental understandings on East Asia. Nowadays, it is appropriate to share discourses across different disciplines. The starting point would be in defining the scope and boundary of East Asia. ‘Soft regionalism’ or ‘Elastic regionalism’ can be a reference point because the boundary and membership of a regional community is dependent upon the characteristics of its objective rather than is predetermined. The recent interdependence among citizens and countries in East Asia is the holistic social interaction process. Rather operating separate manners, the economic, political, security, and cultural aspects are coherently shaped, thus efforts on how to produce synergistic effects have substantial merits. The East Asian Community is not necessarily to be a counterpart of those of the western society. To achieve a certain objective of a community, it is essential to work in collaborative manners nowadays because the global society has become increasingly interdependent. The global-level effort for sustainable environments would be a good example. Under the fast-paced, interdependent global regime, with exclusive manners, it would not be possible to structure a regional community. Through the open regionalism, which is the progressive and collaborative approach with countries in other regions, realistic and sustainable East Asian Communities would be possible.				‘동아시아’와 ‘동아시아지역주의’, 그리고 동아시아 ‘공동체’ 및 ‘정체성’ 형성에 관한 문제는 지난 20년간 우리나라 학계 안팎에서 꾸준히 주된 논쟁의 주제가 되어왔다. 초기에 주로 문학, 역사, 철학 등 인문학 분야에서 ‘동아시아’가 호명되기 시작하더니, 1990년대 말부터 동아시아 발전문제를 다루는 사회과학자들 사이에는 동아시아의 특수성과 정체성에 대한 논의로 이어졌고, 그 후 경제학자들과 국제정치학자들 사이에서 동아시아지역에 경제공동체와 안보공동체를 형성해야 할 필요성에 대한 논의가 제기되었다. 동아시아의 지역공동체 형성이란 주제를 제대로 다루기 위해서는 자신의 학문적 소영지를 고수하려는 학문적 지역주의에서 벗어나 분과학문간 경계를 자유롭게 넘나드는 융복합적 상상력을 발휘할 필요가 있다. 또한 이는 동아시아에 대한 기본적인 문제의식만 공유한다면 어떤 학문영역에서 제기된 논의라도 분과학문 간의 경계를 뛰어넘어 이를 하나로 묶어 사유해 보고자 하는 시도이기도 하다. 그리고 지금이야말로 동아시아와 동아시아지역주의에 관한 여러 가지 의제를 놓고, 여러 학문 분야에서 다양한 관점과 주장을 가진 사람들이 서로 소통하고 함께 고민할 수 있는 공통의 담론의 장이 열려야 할 때가 아닌가 생각한다. 그리고 타지역을 타자화하고 이를 배제하고 경계하는 폐쇄적 자세로는 시공간적으로 더욱 더 압축되고 있는 미래의 지식정보화, 세계화 사회에서 지역공동체를 담보하는 것이 결코 쉽지 않은 일일 것이다. 보다 전향적, 적극적인 입장에서 타지역의 여러 국가와 대화하고 협력하는 개방적 지역주의에 입각할 때만이 비로소 보다 현실적이고 미래사회에 적합한 동아시아공동체의 가능성은 열릴 것이다.					0	0	0	0	0	1738-6497		KJD:ART001841655

I suggest that the movements of horse dance contains the meaning of ‘choice’ that lacks conviction and ambition in ‘man and woman epic’, conservatism and conformity in ‘son and daughter epic’ and shortage of generosity in ‘father and mother epic.’The Horse Dance is the reflection of worldwide economic crisis and women's desire to advance into society. Also it contains the wisdom to overcome the fears arising from these social phenomena.				무용인류학적으로 말춤의 언어적 의미, 즉 무용서사(the epic of dance)를 해석하고, 이를 통해 말춤에 담겨있는 한국적인 원형과 현재 세계인의 공통의 서사가 무엇이며,그리고 한국인의 춤이 어떻게 세계인의 문제를 해소하고 있는지 살펴보는 것을 목표로 한다. 무용서사는 문학치료학의 ‘서사(The epic)’이론과 인간의 네 가지 기초서사 유형을 근원으로 춤동작의 언어적 해석을 시도하는 것이다. 춤동작의 의미를 인간의 서사와 관련지어분석하는 연구는 아직 무용학의 어떤 분야에서도 시도되지 않았다. 문학치료학에서는 인간의 삶은 ‘서사(the epic)’가 작동하는 것으로 ‘인간이 바로 문학이며, 문학이 곧 인간’이라고본다. 문학치료학의 ‘서사’개념은 “인간관계의 형성과 위기와 회복”에 대한 이야기를 말한다. 문학치료학은 인간의 기초 서사를 크게 네 가지로 ‘자녀서사·남녀서사·부부서사·부모서사’로나누어 설명하는데, 각각 ‘순응, 선택, 지속, 양육’이라는 인간의 근본적인 문제를 문학을 통해 파악하고 치유하는 것이 기본 원리이다(정운채, 2008, pp.247~256). 무용서사는 춤동작으로 이어진 무용작품의 서사뿐만 아니라 개별 춤동작도 ‘서사’로 해석될 수 있으며, 그 속에인간의 ‘서사’가 발견된다고 본다. 무용서사는 춤동작 또는 작품 전체의 서사를 통해 역사적,사회적 변화에 따른 인간의 서사의 변화, 그리고 안무자 개인의 서사도 읽어내는 것이다.					0	0	0	0	0	1598-4672		KJD:ART001818050		
J	신상진; 김윤희; 황진섭; 안정훈; Lee, Sang Moo; 이윤재								Utilities for prostate cancer by cancer stage and treatment step in Korea			한국에서 전립샘암 병기별․치료시기별 삶의 질					The Korean Journal of Health Economics and Policy	보건경제와 정책연구			19	2			1	20					2013	2013	This study was conducted to estimate the quality of life of the prostate cancer patients by cancer stage and treatment step in South Korea. Health scenarios including clinical symptoms and treatment complications that the prostate cancer patients may experience were developed through discussion with clinical experts and Korean Urological Association. A face-to-face survey using Time-Trade Off (TTO) to each imaginary health scenario was administered to 160 male subjects to measure the preference of general public. The results showed that the utility index was estimated to be 0.727 at the first year of treatment and 0.653 at the second year after local cancer diagnosis, 0.545 at the first year and 0.451 at the second year after locally advanced cancer diagnosis. For metastatic cancer diagnosis, the utility index was 0.321 in the first year and 0.149 in the second year. The utility index decreased by cancer stage, and it was lower in the management and follow up period than in intensive treatment period. Caution is needed to estimate the utility index by asking the general public using imaginary health scenarios, especially, about complex health status. The study would encourage discussion about estimating utility index for use of economic evaluation among health care researchers.				본 연구는 전립샘암 환자의 병기별 치료시기별 삶의 질을 추정하고자 수행되었다. 일반인의 선호도를 반영한 전립샘암의 삶의 질을 측정하고자 실제 환자들이 겪게 되는 증상 및 치료 부작용에 대한 시나리오를 관련 임상전문의 및 비뇨기과 학회의 도움을 받아 작성하였다. 일반남성 160명을 대상으로 시간교환법을 이용하여 가상의 시나리오에 따른 전립샘암의 삶의 질을 조사하였다. 연구 결과 국소암 진단 후 첫 1년째의 삶의 질은 0.727, 2년째는 0.653, 국소진행암은 진단 후 첫 1년째의 삶의 질은 0.545, 2년째는 0.451로 나타났다. 전이암 진단 후 첫 1년째의 삶의 질은 0.321, 2년째의 삶의 질은 0.149로 분석되었다. 즉, 국소암, 국소진행암, 전이암 순으로 삶의 질이 더 낮고 집중적 치료시기보다 관리 및 정기적 호르몬 치료시기에서 더 낮은 것으로 나타났다. 본 연구 결과를 통하여 경제성 평가에서 활용하는 삶의 질을 추정하는데 있어 복잡한 건강상태의 경우 각 건강상태별로 가상의 시나리오를 구축하여 일반인에게 설문하는 것에는 세심한 주의가 필요함을 재확인하였다. 본 연구를 계기로 경제성 평가에서 필요한 삶의 질 가중치를 추정하는 방법에 대한 관련 연구자들간 활발한 논의가 이루어지길 기대한다.					0	0	0	0	0	1738-7302		KJD:ART001783003		
J	오민석								Literary (Cultural) Theory and Ethics: Focusing on Terry Eagleton			문학(문화)이론과 윤리: 테리 이글턴을 중심으로					The New Korean Journal of English Lnaguage & Literature	새한영어영문학			55	1			67	88					2013	2013	This essay tries to explore the category of ethics in literary and cultural theory focusing on Terry Eagleton. Eagleton has constructed the theory of ethics more drastically since the publication of After Theory. His project is to combine the materialism of everyday life with Christianity for which he appropriates the Lacanian tripartite of the Imaginary, the Symbolic, and the Real. To opt for the everyday life is based upon his belief that the redemption should be practiced on the material level and his selection of Christianity is to extend the height of ethics to the utmost, since, if not, there will be no absolute way of resolution. To avoid the suspicion of moralism, he bestows the level of politics on his ethics and warns the violence of religious fundamentalism. This ethical and theological turn of his has long been prepared since his first book titled The New Left Church. Considering the academic market since late 1960s which denies any kind of meta-narrative and emphasizes the multiplicity of meaning, Eagleton’s ethical attempt not only seems to be a kind of intellectual adventure, but also has the significance of breaking through a new way of theory. His ethics has some lacks despite the achievements. To combine materialism and Christianity, there should be a more detailed, material, and institutional medium to connect these two too oppositional poles, but it is hard to find it in his ethics. One more thing to be completed in his ethics is to provide the theory with devices of interpreting literary and cultural texts.									0	0	0	0	0	1598-7124		KJD:ART001743178		
J	Thompson, Erik Robb								Cultural Not Political Colonization in the Poems of Wallace Stevens								The New Korean Journal of English Lnaguage & Literature	새한영어영문학			55	1			191	213					2013	2013	The reason for Stevens’ skepticism regarding cultural colonies is clear. Most of the people in America are descendents of immigrants who bring with them their own cultural ideas to a colony. That is the reality of the American situation, and it is also Stevens’ modest understanding of the reality of an America that was still in the process of trying to express its cultural relationship to the vast continent of North America. Tacit in that choice, however, is a rejection of a political solution that would preserve out-of-date cultural ideals such as that contained in the example of General Andrew Jackson, a figure who appears several times in Stevens’ poetry and prose and who was famous both for waging brutal wars against the Seminole Indians in Florida and for being a champion of a populist form of political democracy. Stevens’ emphasis on failure and division in his poems about American colonization, then, can be understood as a way to defamiliarize a political understanding of who Americans are as a people in order to create a basis for a new modernist cultural understanding of an American place. Of the many characters and motifs that typify Stevens’ imaginary colonists in exile, I will focus on Stevens’ hidalgo figure as a unifying concept to cover all figures who fail at cultural colonization in Stevens’ poems. The term hidalgo, meaning a Spanish country gentleman, only appears five times in the corpus of Stevens’ poetry, but it can be deployed usefully to describe a colonist from a traditional as opposed to a modern culture. As the term is used here, hidalgo refers to the inhabitants (landed elites and feudal peasants alike) of a place who have acquired “tenure in the land” through generations of habits and customs cultivated in tandem with the particulars of a homeland’s culture, climate and landscape.									0	0	0	0	0	1598-7124		KJD:ART001743192		
J	Chang-Won, Kim								On the Symbolism & Historicity of the space of Gangnam in classical poetry			고전시가에서 “江南”이라는 공간의 상징성과 역사성에 대하여					The Research of the Korean Classic	韓國古典硏究			28				55	76					2013	2013	In classical poetry, the word Gangnam, meaning to the south of Yangtze River, appears as various different names such as Gangsa, Sosanggang, Dongjungho, Chango etc. in which the most important feature of those areas lies in their nature of tragedy. And this symbolic space of tragedy appears frequently as a space longing for King or exile literature that depicts faithful subject, virtuous women as a main character. This imaginary space of Gangnam of such meaning appears mainly in the literature of Seoul yangban in Joseon Dynasty. As such it likely to reflects Shimsangjiri-the imaginative geography- of Seoul yangbans -noble men, who had been living over several centuries centered in Gyeongjeo (resident in Seoul)- Byelseo(resident outside Seoul). Furthermore, if it was related to the residential space of Seoul yangban, the original birth place of imaginative geography can be deemed to have come from center oriented directivity that yangban had at that point of age.				우리 고전시가에서 ‘양자강 이남’이라는 의미의 “강남(江南)”은 장사(長沙), 소상강(瀟湘江), 동정호(洞庭湖), 창오(蒼梧) 등의 다양한 이름으로 나타난다. 이때 이 지역이 가지는 가장 중요한 특징은 그 비극성에 있다. 그리고 이 비극적 상징공간은 충신, 열녀를 주인공으로 하는 연군, 유배문학의 공간으로 자주 나타난다. 이런 의미의 “강남”이라고 하는 상징공간은 특별히 조선시대 서울양반들의 문학에서 주로 나타나고 있다. 그것은 누대에 걸쳐 경저(京邸)-별서(別墅)를 중심으로 생활했던 서울양반들의 심상지리를 반영하는 것일 가능성이 높다. 그리고 그것이 서울양반의 거주지 공간개념과 연관된 것이라면, 이러한 심상지리의 더욱 근원적인 발생지는 당대 양반들이 가지고 있던 중앙중심적 지향성에 있다고 볼 수 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	1226-3850		KJD:ART001832409

This paper explains that the specificity of literary spatiality is the contradiction originated in blending the Idea and the Real. I've analyzed the travel essays and novels with their backgrounds in Russia written by Lee Kwang-soo. Especially, I've tried to emphasize on 'the outside of imaginary geography' which exist as the origin of anxiety without binding the subject in an owner's viewpoint. Main points are:Ontological abyss caused by overlapping civilization dis- course and fatalism, drive toward dissipated pleasure hidden Tolstoyan Idealism, and interaction between the self and the other appeared in his book, titled 'His autobiograghy'. All points can be evidence of 'abyss of uncertainty', the Real faced with the border of the ideal certainty.				이 논문은 춘원의 러시아 관련 산문 및 소설을 대상으로, 문학적 공간의 재현 양상을 관념적 공간과 실재적 공간의 경합 혹은 모순적 겹침의 형태로 읽어보고자 한 것이다. 근대 문학의 지리적 상상력을 식민지의 심상지리로 還元하곤 하는 분석 경향을 반성하고, 문학적 공간의 재현 방식이 도리어 관념과 실재의 錯綜에서 오는 모순상태의 현현으로서 나타난다는 점을 주장하였다. 춘원 문학에서 러시아라는 공간이 재현되는 방식을 들어, 시선의 주인인 주체에게 귀속되지 않은 채 불안의 源泉으로 존재하는 세계의 형상, 즉 심상지리의 ‘외부’를 제시하고자 했다. 문명 담론에 겹쳐진 숙명론의 그늘, 톨스토이적 이상주의와 겹쳐진 육체적 쾌락 및 방탕을 향한 충동, ‘그의 자서전’이라는 명명에 내포된 자아와 타자의 겹침이라는 테마를 논하였다. 이들은 모두 명료한 관념적 질서의 영역의 경계에서 마주친 통제 불능의 실재, ‘불확실성의 深淵’의 정황이다.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-1617		KJD:ART001785730		
J	박종용								The Confucius' Theory of Great Unity and The Open Society			儒家의 大同社會와 열린사회					THE STUDY OF CONFUCIAN PHILOSOPHY AND CULTURE	유교사상문화연구			54				361	388					2013	2013	Traditionally we have used the phrase "the Confucius’ theory of Great Unity in East-Asia, which is the spirit of establishing the moral identity and restoring the human's good Nature with practicing the benevolent administration based on Humanity (仁) and Justice (義) in our mind. Here Humanity (仁) is the philanthropy (汎愛) as the relationship of the counterpart in that 'I’and 'you' can love each other truly and heartily. We in boundless imagination conceive Utopia and expect the newly reformed society at the thought that one's dream can be vision, if shared with others'. We think that human basically aims at the universal love for Beings, not at the control for possession. So this is why we believe in the possibility of accomplishing Utopia. The Great Unity and Utopia have two directly-opposed ideas. The first is the difference in that the one has the strong will to step toward the existent society in the past and the other desires a nonexistent society in imaginary. The second is the common now that two concepts above aim at the philanthropy among people out of distorted possession and control in the present. The Open society relies on Reason, Liberty, and Belief in universal love for human, not at the invariable rule or the traditional authority. A world that sage kings in Confucianism govern can be only thought as the Open society composed of a unified humankind. The Open society puts emphasis on the harmony and respects the differences and the diversities among people. So it is the place where Coexistence and Peace have their vitalities. Our greed in a maternalistic world that gives priority to the private desire before the public utility may be the primary cause that changes the Great Unity into the Little society and the Open society into the Closed society. The basic solution for this can be sought for in the Confucius' theory of Great Unity for truly realizing peace for all mankind, not in ‘the Globalization of Desire’ indulged in economic profits. The Confucius' theory of Great Unity is the humanistic Utopia that fulfills all human's ability with bearing the fruits of Love and is ‘the Art of Loving [汎愛]’ for identifying that ‘you are in my mind [萬物皆備於我矣]’. This is the very society such as the Open society to Karl. R. Popper, the Sane society to Erich Fromm, and Utopia to Thomas More. We suggest that the Confucius ' theory of Great Unity can include all the ideal societies of both East and West.				전통적으로 동아시아에서는 정치적 이상세계를 의미하는 말로 유가의 대동 사회라는 말을 사용해왔다. 이는 인간의 마음속에 내재되어있는 仁과 義를 바탕으로 德治를 행함으로써 인간의 착한 본성을 회복하여 도덕적 주체성을 확립하고자 하는 理念이다. 여기서 仁이란 내가 타자를 사랑하고 타자가 나를 사랑하는 대대관계에서의 汎愛인 것이다. 인간의 상상력은 ‘나의 꿈을 사람들과 공유하게 되면 비전이 된다’는 생각에서 유토피아를 잉태하게 되고 새로운 변혁의 시대를 희구하게 된다. 유토피아의 실현이 가능하다고 보는 근거도 인간이 근본적으로 ‘소유를 위한 지배’가 아니라 ‘존재에 대한 사랑’을 지향한다고 믿기 때문이다. 대동 사회와 유토피아는 두 가지 상반된 관념을 지니고 있다. 하나는 전자가 존재했던 곳을 향해 나아가려는 의지이고 후자는 존재하지 않았던 곳을 희구하는 상상력에서 차이점이 있다 하겠고, 다른 하나는 위의 두 개념이 모두 현실의 뒤틀린 소유와 지배에 대한 충동에서 벗어나 인간의 존재와 존재간의 汎愛를 지향하려는 데서 공통점이 있다고 하겠다. 열린사회는 불변의 규칙이나 전통적 권위에 의존하는 것이 아니라, 이성과 자유 및 인간에 대한 박애의 신념에 의존한다. 儒家에서는 聖王이 다스리는 세계야말로 ‘하나 된 인류’로 이루어진 ‘열린사회’ 라고 생각한다. 열린사회는 사람들 간의 조화를 중시하고 차이와 다양성이 존중됨으로써 비로소 공존과 평화가 가능한 곳이다. 물질만능 시대에 公보다 私를 앞세우려는 우리의 過慾이 大同을 小康으로, 열린사회를 닫힌사회로 변질시키는 주된 원인이 아닐까 싶다. 이에 대한 근본적인 해법은 경제논리[利]에 매몰된 욕망의 세계화 (Globalization)가 아니라 참다운 인류평화를 실현하기 위한 ‘위대한 통일의 세계화 [大同 : The Confucius' Theory of Great Unity]’에서 모색될 수 있다. ‘위대한 통일의 세계화’란 인간이 갖고 있는 모든 역량을 꽃피우고 사랑으로 열매를 맺게 하는 휴머니즘의 유토피아(Utopia)이자 ‘내안에 그대 있음[萬物皆備於我矣]’을 확인하는 ‘사랑의 기술[汎愛]’이기 때문이다. 이러한 사회가 칼 포퍼에게는 열린사회이자, 에리히 프롬에게는 건전한 사회가 되고, 토마스 모어의 유토피아인 것이며 이와 같은 동․서양의 모든 理想社會觀을 아우를[綱] 수 있는 것이 儒家의 大同社會라고 본다.					0	0	0	0	0	1226-7082		KJD:ART001839074		
J	Sam, Kim Dug; 최원혁								Pre- qin Confucius thought's empathy from Me, Here and Now.			선진유가에 나타난 공감으로서의 나 여기 지금					THE STUDY OF CONFUCIAN PHILOSOPHY AND CULTURE	유교사상문화연구			54				389	414					2013	2013	Although ruled the world once but fell as a symbol of conservatism, pre-qin Confucius thought is re-lighted on the theme of empathy nowadays. Confucianism have three major backgrounds as a re-illuminated empathy theory. First, re-illumination of empathy as a theoretical backgrounds, second, rediscovery of acceptence and confrontation of Eastern and Western culture as a historical background, third, the creativity possessed by the Confucianism as empathy theory. First, with regard to re-illumination of empathy , the discovery of mirror neurons , de-construction of reason, and the end of ideology showed that morality is more related to emotions rather than to rationality. Actually non-humane experiments and modern evolution theory demonstrated that empathy is immediate, unconcious and rational unlike existing theory that empathy is irrational and imaginary. Empathy can be an powerful alternative to rationality nowadays. Second, a re-enlightment on acceptence and confrontation of Eastern and Western culturealso showed empathy theory of Confucianism became basis on tolerence theory of Locke, Hume,and Adam Smith. Thirdly, empathy theory of Confucianism have the pecularity of Confucious and Mencius bravity to confront violence and immediateness of empathy. The reason that Confucianism ruled the world once started from here, now, and me. The mean (中庸) and the concentration(執中) represent Empathy theory of Confucianism beggining from here, now, and me.				본 연구에서는 선진시기 유가의 사상을 중심으로 공감과 존재론적 측면의 나 여기 지금이 어떠한 의미를 가지고 있는지 알아보았다. 이를 위해, 본고에서는 선진유가와 공감, 선진유가와 나 여기 지금, 그리고 선진유가에 있어 공감과 나 여기 지금의 문제를 알아보았다. 선진시기 유가의 사상은 일상 속에 살아있는 학문으로 존재했다. 바로 나와 여기와 지금의 문제에 집중하였다. 공감을 도덕의 기초로 발견시킬 수 있었던 것은 바로, 나 여기 지금을 중심으로 생각했기 때문이다. 또한 집중(執中)과 중용(中庸)을 통해서 나 여기 지금을 공감이론의 방법론으로 활용하였기 때문이다. 본 연구는 선진시기 유가를 공감으로서의 나 여기 지금으로 알아본 시론(試論)에 불과하다. 아직, 선신시기 유가에 대한 공감이론으로의 접근이나, 공감으로서의 나 여기 지금으로서의 접근이 많이 시도되고 있지 않기 때문이다. 그러나 시대적 요청과 유가 사상의 창신(創新)이란 측면에서 지속적으로 연구해야 할 것임을 미약하나마 본 연구를 통해 확인할 수 있을 것이라 기대한다.					0	0	0	0	0	1226-7082		KJD:ART001839075		
J	NAM, Sung Hyun								A Collaboration for the Poor of the Early Byzantine Empire and Christianity			초기 비잔틴 제국과 기독교의 빈민을 위한 협력 모델 연구					The Western History Review	서양사론			118				5	32					2013	2013	New Christian leaders called ‘Poor Euergetes’ came into existence in the 4th-6th century in the Byzantine World. The Poor Euergetes,monks or bishops who abandoned their property for Christ, were new heroes of the Christian period inaugurated by Constantine the Great in the 4th century. Nevertheless, they did not originate simply from Christian monastic spirituality. With the birth of the new leading class, the Poor Euergetes were also influenced by Hebrew-Jewish spirituality. This called for the care on the poor and the Greeko-Roman tradition of euergesia. It is worthwhile to pay attention to the imperial constitutions written since the 4th century. These influenced numerous Christian institutions. Constantine the Great offered to the church a right of inheritance. This right was not a problem until the 6th century. On the other hand, several Emperors like Leo, Anastasios and Justinianus aimed at the growth of numerous of Christian institutions with a policy called ‘prohibitio alienandi.’ This policy helped them to engage in the establishment and operation of the hospitals of the Christian Euergetes for the poor. I presented a list of some hospitals administrated by monasteries and churches. The Poor Euergetes that Christian hagiography of the 4th-6th century described were not imaginary but a historical leading group which established these hospitals and cared for the poor. Consequently, the imperial policy and Christian institutions collaborated for the charitable care of the poor in Early Christian Civilization.									0	0	0	0	0	1229-0289		KJD:ART001812181

Fox Hunting by Hu-myung Yoon was analyzed in this research and the findings are as follow. Firstly, the character's cognitive strategy which illustrates the confident travel from South Korea to Russia foregrounds the two elements: ground and path. Secondly, the character sharpens the ideological fault line through top-down processing and the character hereby deals with uncertainty accompanied with traveling experience. Thirdly, the character's categorical personal perception shows both cognitive appraisal (danger) and emotional biases (anxiety and fear) and it reveals behavioral characteristics that the character consistently watches out for others. Fourthly, the character copes with vulnerability as a liberalist through appropriation from an actual forest to an imaginary forest. This reveals political meanings implied in narrator's cognitive mapping.				본 연구는 여행서사의 작중인물이 정보를 처리하는 인지전략 혹은 인식의 지도그리기를 해명하고 이로써 서사에 대한 인지서사학적 접근 가능성을 모색하는 데 목적을 둔다. 윤후명의 <여우사냥>을 분석한 결과, 첫째, 한국에서 러시아로의 당당한 여행을 강조한 작중인물의 인지전략은 배경과 경로 요소를 전경화한다. 둘째, 작중인물은 하향식 인지과정을 통해 한국과 러시아의 이데올로기적 단층을 예각화하고, 이로써 이동경험에 수반된 인식의 불확실성에 대처한다. 셋째, 작중인물의 범주적 대인지각은 위험하다는 인지적 평가, 불안과 두려움이라는 감정적 편향에 이르고 지속적으로 타인을 경계하는 행동특성을 드러낸다. 넷째, 작중인물은 사실의 숲을 상상의 숲으로 전유함으로써 자유주의자로서의 취약성을 상상적으로 해결한다. 이것이 서술자의 인식의 지도그리기가 함축한 정치적 의미이다.					0	0	0	0	0	1226-9913		KJD:ART001762664

The experiences appear as fantasy and cause confusion repeating the fantasy and reality. This paper is aimed to analyze the agony in the real world and the fantasy of Lee, Myung Joon in KWANG JANG and then study on the process to find the world he dreamt. Lee, Myung Joon, main character, tried to satisfy his desire that was not filled from his mother in his youth by changing an object of desire. His pursuing object of desire is replaced; from mother, South Korean society, Yoon Ae, North Korean society, Yoon Hye, neutral nation to sea. Psychological anxiety over reality is the reason why he changes the object of desire, but Lee, Myung Joon is the character who is faithful to his desire. Freud said that human desire can be satisfied by his/her death. This means that desiring nothing is death itself. Endless desire of human being is natural. Thus, humankind develops. The desire for instinct of Lee, Myung Joon is concluded with the freedom in a fantasy world, but psychological contemplation on his fantasy and death needs more research.				최인훈은 여러 작품에서 유년기 체험이 반복되어 나타난다. 유년기의 체험은 작품에서 환상으로 나타나며, 환상과 현실의 반복으로 혼란을 일으키기도 한다. 본고는 <廣場>을 자끄 라깡의 ‘욕망이론’과 에리히 프롬의 ‘도피의 메카니즘’을 적용하여 주인공 이명준의 심리적 세계를 분석한다. 사실주의 대표작으로 알려진 <廣場>을 환상성이라는 시각으로 고찰하는데 목적이 있다. 상상계, 상징계, 실재계에 의한 대상의 환유과정은 이명준의 욕망심리를 구체적으로 표현하고 있다. 주인공 이명준은 어린 시절 어머니에게 충족되지 못한 욕구를 성인이 되어 그 대상을 바꾸어가며 충족하려고 한다. 그가 어릴 때 어머니로부터 충족하지 못한 욕망은 남한 현실에서 윤애로 대체되며, 윤애에게 총족하지 못한 그의 욕망은 북한 사회로 대체된다. 그러나 북한 사회에서도 그의 욕망은 충족하지 못하고, 은혜에게 대체된다. 전쟁으로 인한 은혜의 죽음으로 다시 새로운 욕망 충족을 위해 중립국으로 향하지만 그것 또한 만족하지 못한다. 결국 푸른 바다를 유영하는 갈매기들은 그가 사랑하는 은혜와 딸이 환각되어 보인다. 그는 그녀들이 유영하는 푸른 바다로 뛰어든다. 푸른 바다는 이명준이 현실에서 욕망하는 것을 충족할 수 있는 자유로운 곳으로 여겨진다. 현실에 대한 심리적 불안이 욕망의 대상을 바꾸는 원인이 되기도 하지만, 이명준은 본능적인 욕망 충족에 충실한 인물이다. 인간의 욕망은 죽음만이 충족시킨다는 프로이드의 말은 아무것도 욕망하지 않는 것은 죽음뿐이라는 말과 같다. 이명준의 본능에 대한 욕망은 환상 속의 자유로 끝났지만, 그의 환상과 죽음에 대한 심리적 고찰은 <廣場>을 욕망과 환상이라는 각도로 분석하는데 의의를 가진다.					0	0	0	0	0	1226-9913		KJD:ART001795847

Regional Pathways: Transnational Imaginaries, Infrastructures and Implications of Student Mobility within Asia								ASIAN AND PACIFIC MIGRATION JOURNAL				22	4	SI		475	500					2013	2013	This paper offers a critical analysis of the narratives of South Korean international students attending universities in the Asian region. It draws in particular on a transnational approach to understanding these mobilities that highlights the imaginaries that generate a desire to be mobile among students, the social and institutional infrastructures that enable mobility, and the implications of student mobility for students' future aspirations and identities. Through this approach, the paper offers a starting point for exploring what is an understudied dimension of international education the increasing number of international students who are choosing to study in Asia rather than in traditional western destinations. The transnational approach taken in this paper also opens up analytical space for understanding student mobility as a social and geographic process that relies on the creative agency of students and their families, but also social networks of friends, alumni and teachers, and the work of institutional actors in piecing together the possibilities for mobility in the region. In this regard, the paper also draws attention to the imbrication of student flows in the emergence of an increasingly interconnected Asia, one that is articulated in the career pathways of graduating students, their identities and their sense of place in a regional future.									2	0	0	0	2	0117-1968		WOS:000331851000002

The article begins with a retrospective genealogy of media and touristic discourses, based on interviews and documents, in order to unveil the knowledge-power discursive order in the image of <Brazilian women>. The second part analyzes subjectivations of Brazilian immigrant women in Portugal, drawing on interviews and participant observation, to unveil situations of prejudice and discrimination and shed light on how the women confront the discursive order by resisting and re-existing as subjects. According to the conclusions, Brazilian women are seen as a "colonial body" to the extent that they are defined, essentialized, and stigmatized through characteristics attributed to them ever since the historical colonial period and related to hypersexuality. Three modes of subjectivation are identified by which these women resist stigma and re-exist: passive, affirmative, and combative resistance.									0	0	0	0	0	0011-5258		WOS:000331867800005

In particular, despite its often elliptical and disjointed structure, Djebar's film represents an important piece of post-colonial Algerian film-making in that, whilst hegemonic and commercial Arab cinema rarely represents narrative space in 'correspondence with the protagonist's subjective perceptions', Djebar's film instead establishes an intimate relationship between sociospatial loci and affective/psychological states. Expanding upon this hypothesis, this article will thus argue that through its subtle spatial grammar Djebar's film symbolically emancipates Algerian women from their state of subalternity within Orientalist/colonial discourse and the post-colonial imaginary.									1	0	0	0	1	1471-5880		WOS:000331803700003

J	Nae, Cristian								RHETORIC OF DISPLAY: CURATORIAL PRACTICE AS ART HISTORY IN POST-COMMUNIST EUROPE								ZIVOT UMJETNOSTI					93			50	67					2013	2013	The ideological aspects of writing art history as parts of a rhetorical construction have been variously stressed. However, less stress has been put both on the association and dissimilarity between curating and writing art history. Especially in the case of the art from the former Central and Eastern-Europe, the curator lately appeared as a substitute for an underdeveloped art historical research on the Region. The present text analyzes the art historical shift in recent curatorial practices concerning art produced in Central-Eastern Europe after 1945, regarded as form of art historical revisionism by creating specific political and temporal imaginaries. By focusing on the logic of visual display as a knowledge/power apparatus and on the operations of archiving, framing and narrating, it addresses the way aesthetic experience and visual rhetoric construct the idea of historicity. It also questions the ways politics of regional identity is embedded in politics of time and the way temporality is enacted by different strategies of spatialization.									0	0	0	0	0	0514-7794		WOS:000332352000004

Application de l'art therapie en psycho-oncologie: evaluation d'une etude exploratoire en milieu extrahospitalier.				Bulletin de la Societe des sciences medicales du Grand-Duche de Luxembourg					1			48	71					2013	2013	According to the state-of-the-art in health psychology and psycho-oncology, a cancerous disease, as well as the accompanying medical treatments, is a source ofintense emotional stress. As feelings of insecurity and anxiety are likely to induce negative effects on immune defences, those effects may overlap with the cancerous disease and complicate its evolution. As arts therapies tend to favour the imaginary and symbolic elaboration of the tensions of daily life, as well as the re appropriation of one's body and personal history, different artistic mediations may occupy an important function in the psychological follow-up of the patient. Following an exploratory study in a hospital, we carried out an action-research in an out-patient setting during six moths. The arts therapeutic treatment comprehended alternatively drawing and writing sessions while listening to music, opening tracks for a thorough verbal elaboration. The evaluation was based on psychometric scales (HADS and MDBF), rating scales for the pictorial and literary production and a semi-structured interview. According to the results of the quantitative analyses, based on non parametric statistical procedures for small groups and non metric data, as well as to the qualitative content analyses, arts therapies could become a valuable treating measure within a multidisciplinary bio-psycho-social approach.									0	0	0	0	0	0037-9247		MEDLINE:23808110	23808110

Why then was she so popular? The article offers original research highlighting how Stein was constructed as a kind of "opium queen" in the popular American press, and the ways that this decadent, bohemian celebrity persona allowed her to operate as "broadly queer" rather than "specifically gay" in the American cultural imaginary-a negotiation that accounts for the mass-market success rather than censure of The Autobiography of Alice B.

J	Gaudilliere, Jean-Paul								Changing the scale: slides and electron microscopy at the Virus Laboratory of the Pasteur Institute.								History and philosophy of the life sciences				35	3			395	414					2013	2013	Slides are material objects, the daily existence of which cannot be diassociated from the practice of microscopy. But what happens to slides when the examination tool is no longer an optical apparatus but an electon microscope? This is the core issue this paper examines. The answer it proposes is that electron microscope slides are not slides in the classical sense of the word but complex arrangements of materials including plates, cards, photographs and notebooks, which constitute an imaginary "slide," an assemblage the status and existence of which is defined in reference to the heritage of optical microscopy. To illustrate this argument, the paper follows the experimental work of Odile Croissant, the first electron microscopist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris during the 1940s and 1950s when the practices of the new microscopy were introduced and calibrated.									0	0	0	0	0	0391-9714		MEDLINE:24779109	24779109	
J	Ostria Gonzalez, Mauricio								THE 'EXALTED COSMOS' OF TERNURA								ATENEA					508			187	196					2013	2013	The poems of Ternura are constructed from images of a permanent childhood in the sense explained by Bachelard: images of solitude impregnated by dream states that allow us to see the world in its beginnings. In this state, all archetypes (fire, air, water, light, earth) are manifested as "exalted cosmos" and are profoundly linked to human beings in a deep and happy communion: the exterior world is an aspect of the inner being. An animistic perception of existence is called up, a great consciousness in which everything exists and interrelates. This is because at the root of this contemplation as expressed in poetry there is a force that allows us to accept life with its intimate contradictions: "synthesis of sentiments that are contraries" (Bachelard) in the imaginary instant that it becomes word.									0	0	0	0	0	0718-0462		WOS:000334150500013

J	Mehring, Frank								"I am an American!" The Thrill of American Citizenship								ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ANGLISTIK UND AMERIKANISTIK				61	4			355	371					2013	2013	The allure of American citizenship and the function of patriotism among naturalized foreigners bring into focus questions of American national identity and the contested belief in the "whole of America." European immigrant perspectives on the promise of the Declaration of Independence, naturalization, and political activism in the cultural arena created unforeseen conflicts in the process of acculturation. Patriotic declarations of Americanness resemble a means of distinguishing oneself from other Americans who appear to be less enthusiastic about the moral responsibility of American citizenship or take it for granted. The difference has often been described in terms of a "thrill." This emotional excitement results from the creation of a fantasy space. Instead of being American by birthright, immigrants repeatedly emphasized the challenge of having to earn citizenship and democratic rights. How does the immigrant definition of Americanness differ from that of American born citizens? In how far does the State Department shape, channel, and control the cultural imaginary connected with the moment of becoming an American? The following article analyzes the complex interplay between the cultural imaginary of intellectual immigrants and the processes of the naturalization ceremony. I will focus on the series of 69 radio broadcasts entitled "I am an American," which were produced between 1940 and 1943 by the Department of Justice of the United States in cooperation with the National Broadcasting Company.									0	0	0	0	0	0044-2305		WOS:000334565400003

A Content Analysis on Spanish, Polish and Romanian TV Representations of EU								TRADITION AND REFORM: SOCIAL RECONSTRUCTION OF EUROPE								253	256					2013	2013	This paper examines the way Spanish, Polish and Romanian prime time TV news programs construct the social representation about the European Union. The data used in this article are part of the international project "Media about the European Union" that aimed to map the EU representations currently in circulation within European countries. The article does not intend to confirm or invalidate various stereotypes that persist today in the collective imaginary, but aims to offer some data which may be useful to understand how various types of Spanish, Polish and Romanian TV channels construct social representations about the EU. The research project analysed the role of political institutions in the development of social representations of the EU. Moreover, this project aimed to examine Spanish, Polish and Romanian media coverage of EU political, economic, legal, cultural, and social affairs. It attempted to outline some of the important debates regarding the effects of the actual economic crisis that have changed media messages in each of sampled country. It has also sought to answer several questions, including the role of the Spanish, Polish and Romanian media in the democratic process at the European level and the extent to which the media contribute to and reflects the process of Europeanization. The methodology applied in this research project combine a mixture of quantitative and qualitative analysis. The Spanish, Polish and Romanian TV channels (TVE1, TVN and ProTV) were monitored during 4-week periods (21st of January to the 21st of February 2013) documenting the themes, topics, actors, schedules, and formats in each TV news program.

Korean has one peculiar type of mitigating discourse markers that came into existence recently and is widely used among the young generation, i.e. makilay and its variants. An analysis of their grammaticalization processes reveals that they involve (i) meta-discursive strategies in that the speaker is monitoring the self's utterances, (ii) a shifted perspective in that an imaginary third-person's evaluative viewpoint is adopted, and (iii) elaborate intersubjectification in that the speaker is attenuating the self's talk by protecting the face of the addressee as well as the speaker in a potentially face-threatening act.

J	Simpach, Ondrej; Pechrova, Marie						Vojackova, H		Assessing the impact of standard of living on the life expectancy at birth using Vector Autoregressive Model								MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN ECONOMICS 2013, PTS I AND II								921	926					2013	2013	The aim of the paper is to evaluate the impact of living standards (LS) on the life expectancy at birth. The LS of the population can be described using different variables. Therefore the first part deals with the questions how to alternatively express the LS and whether a significant correlation exists between the imaginary LS variable and other chosen variables used to express it. As there is a problem with quantifying the LS with specific variables or a specific coefficient, the development of monitored life expectancy is modelled by trend function. The LS is one of the key variables that significantly affect the trend of particular demographic indicators such as life expectancy. Using certain assumptions, we can express the quality of life and its level, which should affect the development of life expectancy. However, as it is shown using Granger causality and VAR model, these general assumptions has limited usage. The life expectancy in the last quarter of 2011 was influenced by its values from previous quarter, last year capacity in elderly homes and the percentage of population living in houses connected to water supply system and drains five quarters ago. The impact of other variables was negligible. In summary, in case of CR, it is difficult to express the indicators, which can at the statistical significance level express and influence the quality of life and the life expectancy.					31st International Conference on Mathematical Methods in Economics	SEP 11-13, 2013		Jihlava, CZECH REPUBLIC	1	0	0	0	1		978-80-87035-76-4	WOS:000335578000156

At the dawn of modern Philosophy, with Descartes, a still metaphysical dualism between "two modes of the same substance" is transformed into a gnoseological dua-lism between, on the one hand, a subject of the scientific knowledge (the epistemic subject), and, on the other hand, systems to be explained: The human body and the nature, i.e., systems of biochemical and physical concepts. Therefore, Descartes's philosophy carries within itself the philosophical content of all inquiries that preceeded it, and it becomes the core from which the several paths and tendencies of the criticism of knowledge and of the Philosophy of Science spring.		Procuraremos mostrar que o imaginário ocidental a respeito da filosofia cartesiana como um "dualismo" não superado e responsável pela ruptura do homem com cultura e natureza colide com as reais posições do filósofo. Na aurora da filosofia moderna, com Descartes, um dualismo ainda metafísico entre "dois modos da mesma substância" transforma-se num dualismo gnoseológico entre, de um lado, um sujeito do conhecimento científico (sujeito epistêmico), e, de outro, sistemas a serem explicados: corpo humano e natureza, ou seja, sistemas de conceitos bioquímicos e físicos. Assim, a filosofia de Descartes reúne em si o conteúdo filosófico de toda investigação anterior a ela, convertendo-se no centro do qual se irradiam os múltiplos caminhos e tendências da crítica do conhecimento e da filosofia das ciências.							0	0	0	0	0	0103-4014		SCIELO:S0103-40142013000300012		
J	Carbullanca N, Cesar								Martyrdom and Jewish apocalyptic outburst in : A proposed biblical theological aesthetics								TEOLOGIA Y VIDA				54	3			411	439					2013	2013	The Article exposes the imaginary antecedents of martyrdom in Jewish apocalyptic, which can be seen through the Study of two Metaphors: the Rapture to Heaven and the Blood of the Righteous. The apocalyptic as aesthetic thought, develops such metaphorica in marginal groups Jews who returned from exile to begin to develop a historical project based on a metaphorical delivery of life by the people or by God, with his subsequent exaltation to Heaven. This imagery is mainly characterized as a political-eschatological interpretation of Death because of the Justice of God, which shows a new rationality of giving life by divine justice.									0	0	0	0	0	0049-3449		WOS:000336523300002

He is a pale reflection of all the others, of the outside world as if he would carry a mirror all the way. At the very beginning of the 20th century aware of their uncertain aesthetic condition, the artists couldn't avoid the nature of the dispersion that deeply infused their reality. Soon, the diseased European atmosphere became a symptom for the disembodied space and for the whole world's disenchantment. Hence, building imaginary spaces out of words prevails in all Modernist programs and ideas and came as a quick response to the extremely perished state of the dissolved Ego but also as an imperative need of regaining a lost unity Extremely eloquent for staging the psychological evolution of the subject, the space textuality comes to re-establish the relation of the underworld fire and the celestial light. Inner and outer space echoes the individual's quest of himself just as microcosm and macrocosm mirror each other. For that reason, the. tremendous effort of building (a book, an imaginary city, a library as utopian space of vegetal memory) fuses iconic figures with a coherent vision of a spiritual universe.									0	0	0	0	0	1221-1249		WOS:000336875300014

From a teratological perspective, I shall try to structure the various forms of monstrous found in fantasy literature according to criteria relating, in general terms, to either the manner in which the human characters perceive the fantastic world, or the manner in which fantastic characters perceive the human, or even the manner in which both the human and the supernatural contribute to the construction of dystopian dimensions.									0	0	0	0	0	1221-1249		WOS:000336875300019

The "counting numbers" are part of us. We know them forward and backward. Babies as young as five months old, psychologists claim, 1 are sensitive to the difference between 1 + 1 and 2 - 1. We sing numbers, counting up the days of Christmas and counting down to the poignant monotheism of "One is one and all alone and evermore shall be so." Our ancestors have added to this repertoire and reckoned with zero and the negative numbers, which were sometimes referred to as fictions (ftctae) before they gained familiarity. All these together constitute what we call the whole numbers,... , -2, -1, 0, + 1, + 2 ...More formally, they are called integers, from the Latin adjective meaning "whole, untouched, unharmed." "Whole," "untouched"; their very name hints that integers can be touched, or fractionated. Indeed they can be, and when they are, we get the larger array of numbers that are fractions, ratios of whole numbers. Fractions, as their notation vividly displays, also stand for proportions (think of 1/2 = 2/4 as "one is to two as two is to four") and for actions (think of 1/2 as "halving," ready to cut in half anything that follows it). To bring fractions into line, we express them as decimals (1/2 = 0.5000000 ...). The modern world gives us much experience with decimals to a high degree of accuracy to " many decimal places"; mathematics, as always, goes all the way, happy to deal with numbers with complete accuracy to infinitely many decimal places. Numbers represented by infinitely many decimal places, whether they are fractions or not, are called real numbers. But the revealing adjective real suggests two things:That these numbers are somehow real to us and that, in contrast, there are unreal numbers in the offing. These are the imaginary numbers. The imaginary numbers are well named, for there is some imaginative work to do to make them as much a part of us as the real numbers we use all the time to measure for bookshelves. So, the purpose of this paper is to give a historical study of the imaginary number from the philosophical point of view.

J	Ali, Nadia Bou								Butrus al-Bustani and the Shipwreck of the Nation								MIDDLE EASTERN LITERATURES				16	3	SI		266	281		10.1080/1475262X.2013.891601			2013	2013	During the outbreak of violence and civil war in 1860 Mount Lebanon, Butrus al-Bustani (1819-1883) in a series of political pamphlets entitled Nafir Suriyya painted an image of an imaginary nation that was meant to be the cure for this social crisis. He also translated the story of Robinson Crusoe during these times and proposed it as an allegory for the instruction of society. This article analyzes Bustani's allegorical use of Robinson Crusoe for a war-torn society. It explores the implications of translation as an epistemological stance in the time of modernity. By Iooking at the two sources, Nafir and Crusoe, we come to understand how the logic of 19th-century liberal political economy works to naturalize sectarianism and depoliticize it through the discourses of pluralism and co-existence that are articulated in Bustani's formulation of 'love' as a binding force for the nation. The article explores the formation of a 'national fantasy' as a response to crisis in affectual terms. Moreover, it shows how Bustani's invocation of the trope of human rights, huquq al-insaniyya, overlaps with a utopian view of justice that is knowingly anachronistic.									0	0	0	0	0	1475-262X		WOS:000339101000004

My paper incorporates three spatial dimensions into this fourfold framework. First, there is the regional context of the city of Helsinki as a KBUD node in Finland, and, similarly, the role of the University of Helsinki as a resource for producing highly educated individuals for the needs of a knowledge-economy. Second, this is the new main library for the University of Helsinki, and as such it is a localized project renovating and creating physical spaces and architectures that is designed for knowledge distribution and dissemination across all mediums. Third, urban image creation has significance as the library is part of the World Design Capital Helsinki 2012 program promoting the international image of Helsinki as a knowledge-based (design) city.

Delta H Lambda O Sigma 'EKIN'H Theta H: AN 'IMAGINARY EARTHQUAKE' ON DELOS IN HERODOTUS AND THUCYDIDES								JOURNAL OF HELLENIC STUDIES				133				135	145		10.1017/S0075426913000086			2013	2013	Thucydides' and Herodotus' comments on a portentous (and unique) Delian earthquake contain the same phrase, but date the event almost 60 years apart and mutually rule out each other's datings. Two additional problems in these passages - geology demonstrates that Delos has never in fact had an earthquake of any significance and kappa iota nu epsilon iota nu is not the word for an earthquake - point to an explanation for the historians' treatment. They are based on the Delphic oracle quoted by Herodotus which promised to 'move unmoved Delos', a paradox based on the island's mythical transition from floating to fixed (Pindar), but liable to confusion with its equally well-known aseismicity. Normally kappa iota nu epsilon iota nu tau alpha alpha kappa iota nu eta tau alpha is used of interfering with religious sites; but the oracle's prediction was interpreted as an earthquake, that was assumed to have occurred in due course (although it had not). Both historians accepted the interpretation, but followed different datings since they invested it with different symbolism, Herodotus of the evils of the Persian and subsequent Greek wars, Thucydides of excited anticipation on the eve of the Peloponnesian War, since for him kappa iota nu eta sigma iota zeta meant 'mobilization' (1.1).									0	0	0	0	0	0075-4269		WOS:000339662500008		
J	Rogers, Dallas								The Poetics of Cartography and Habitation: Home as a Repository of Memories								HOUSING THEORY & SOCIETY				30	3			262	280		10.1080/14036096.2013.797019			2013	2013	This article brings Proust and Bachelard into conversation about inhabiting the home and the role that remembrance, memory and the imagination might play in producing knowledge about the world. Proust and Bachelard both suggest that once a material object, such as a house, has been seized upon by the imagination by those who inhabit the dwelling, it no longer makes sense to assess the space-of-home using "objective" or "mathematical" modalities. Proust's novel has particular relevance in suggesting how we might think about how the material objects of the home serve as the repository for memories. The aim is to investigate the tension between the experience of urban space and its representations to make cognizant and explicit the use of mathematically informed signs. I suggest that the material features of the urban landscape and home itself hold memories that should be viewed as significant artifacts that constitute how we understand the world. I argue that the formation of the self is constituted through our relations with both imaginary and material objects. This position challenges a concept of the home whereby habitation and imagination are constructed as subordinate to the mathematical measurements of the material world.									1	0	0	0	1	1403-6096		WOS:000343027800004		
J	Gerkushenko, Georgy; Sokolova, Svetlana						Escudeiro, P; DeCarvalho, CV		What Can Play Theory Tell us About Computer Games for Young Children?								PROCEEDINGS OF THE 7TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON GAMES BASED LEARNING, VOLS 1 AND 2		Proceedings of the European Conference on Games-Based Learning						179	189					2013	2013	Play-based learning is defined as a context for learning through which children organize and make sense of their social worlds, as they interact actively with people, objects and representations. Young children's play allows them to explore, identify, negotiate, take risks and create meaningful ideas. Children who are constantly engaged in play experiences have much more developed memory skills, language development and self-regulation than children who lack the play activity. The purpose of the paper is to find out what the most important factors are for teachers' selection computer programs for kindergarten classroom activities. Whether the factors concern the theory of children's play development? Do kindergarten teachers need the scaffolding program for their choice of computer games for using in the classroom? What should be the essence of the program? Preliminary study made by authors in Russian Federation shows the lack of teacher's computer literacy. This situation leads the absence of computer games or incompetent using them in pedagogical work with children. By studying general characteristics of play we identify the main criteria which can be used for choosing appropriate game for classroom activities. For instance, choosing a game teacher should answer the question, if this computer game allows children to create their own scenarios, rules and characters of the play or if it enables children acting in an imaginary situation? The paper gives an overview of the computer games for preschool children used in Russian kindergartens; it also contains the scaffolding features on using computer games for children's development. It summarized the problems and recommendations to scaffolding process for teachers who are interested in using computer games for effective children's development.					7th European Conference on Games Based Learning	OCT 03-04, 2013		Inst Super Engn Porto, Porto, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	2049-0992	978-1-909507-65-4	WOS:000343421700022

The narrators would bear several roles, on the one hand, as the writer's "second self", on the other hand, rolling as the imaginary reader who is responsible for the double tasks of both lengthening or shortening the distance between the writer and the readers. So the function of a narrator lays not only classifying the sea of stories and framing the novel, but also influencing the narration and the reading effects directly by the narrator's involvement.					3rd International Conference on Social Sciences and Society (ICSSS)	DEC 27-28, 2013	Informat Engn Res Inst	SOUTH KOREA	0	0	0	0	0	2160-1070	978-1-61275-061-3	WOS:000345533900061		
J	Chiriac, Horia Costin								SCIENTIFIC AND RELIGIOUS IMAGINARY IN THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY				9	1			111	122					FEB 2013	2013	Knowledge society was favoured in its evolution by the rise of information society; therefore there is a strong relation within this type of society between information, knowledge and power. But this relation is mediated by technology, which nowadays has a remarkable influence on life conditions and social dynamics. One can easily observe the particular way in which informational networks influence the development of a veritable 'social synergy' as regards the spreading of new convictions, new lifestyles, new customs and new attitudes regarding social realities. As a consequence, the relation between technology and axiology becomes significant within contemporary culture, the modern ideal centred on the moral neutrality of Science and technology becoming obsolete in postmodern times. In this respect, one could also notice the fact that the emergence of new technologies, among them the genetic ones, could have tremendous influence upon ethics debates but also upon the way in which spirituality is conceptualized. As regards the interference between scientific mythology and contemporary religious mythology, the influence of imaginary is remarkable. Thus, we consider that in knowledge society the engineer becomes directly responsible for understanding and explaining the implications of this relation between Science, technology and spirituality for the general public. What we intend to emphasize in the present paper refers to the way in which contemporary technology, as a practical effect of descriptive scientific scenarios, could influence the way in which human condition is understood and assumed at practical but also spiritual level by contemporary people. Such a situation could also have important implications as regards the ethics of research and engineering teaching.									1	0	0	0	1	1841-0464		WOS:000312054200012

In Study 1, participants viewed either a famous actor's Twitter page or a news article merely relaying his Tweets. Exposure to the Twitter page (vs. news article) induced stronger feelings of actual conversation (i.e., social presence) among less affiliative individuals, whereas the reverse was true for more socially proactive ones. Social presence, in turn, facilitated parasocial interaction with the target and heightened the participants' willingness to watch his movie, with limited effects on their overall evaluation of the target. Study 2, which employed a lesser known local politician using a different microblogging service, replicated the advantage of SNS communication over the news article for socially reserved individuals, with no corresponding effect for more affiliative ones.									5	0	0	0	5	0093-6502		WOS:000313057400002		
J	Lammerts, D. Christian								Narratives of Buddhist legislation: Textual authority and legal heterodoxy in seventeenth through nineteenth-century Burma								JOURNAL OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN STUDIES				44	1			118	144		10.1017/S0022463412000653			FEB 2013	2013	For more than a century scholars of central and western mainland Southeast Asia have sought to characterise the status of dhammasattha - the predominant genre of written law from the region before colonialism - and define its authority vis-a-vis Pali Buddhism. For some, dhammasattha texts represent a predominantly 'secular' or 'customary' tradition, while for others they are seen as largely commensurate with, if not directly derived from, the religio-political ideas of a cosmopolitan and purportedly canonical 'Theravada'. However, scholarship has yet to investigate the way that regional authors during the late premodern period themselves understood the character and legitimacy of written law. The present article examines seventeenth through nineteenth-century Burmese narratives concerning the genealogy and status of dhammasattha to advance a pluralist conception of the relationship between law and religion in Southeast Asian history. This analysis addresses a historical context where ideas concerning Buddhist textual authority were in the process of development, and where there were multiple and competing discourses of legal ideology in play. For elite monastic critics closely connected with royalty, dhammasattha stood in problematic relation to authoritative taxonomies of scripture, and its jurisprudence was seen to contradict authorised accounts of the origin and nature of Buddhist law; the genre thus required reform to be brought into alignment with what were construed as orthodox legal imaginaries. The principal hermeneutic move these monastic commentators performed to achieve this involved redescribing dhammasattha in light of such accounts as a variety of Buddhist royal legislation and written law as the prerogative of the Buddhist state.									0	0	0	0	0	0022-4634		WOS:000312393000007

During these years, children's fantasy-reality differentiation undergoes significant development. Our study was aimed at exploring the links between nighttime fears and fantasy-reality differentiation in preschool children. Eighty children (aged: 4-6 years) suffering from severe nighttime fears were compared with 32 non-fearful controls. Fears were assessed using child and parental reports. Children viewed images depicting fantastic or real entities and situations, and were asked to report whether these were imaginary or could occur in real life. The results revealed that children with nighttime fears demonstrated more fantasy-reality confusion compared to their controls. These differences in fantasy-reality differentiation were more pronounced in younger children. Additional significant associations were found between fantasy-reality differentiation and age and specific characteristics of the stimuli. These preliminary findings, suggesting a developmental delay in fantasy-reality differentiation in children with nighttime fears, have significant theoretical and clinical implications.									0	0	0	0	0	0009-398X		WOS:000314065000012	22760490

The Assessment of Elaborated Role-play in Young Children: Invisible Friends, Personified Objects, and Pretend Identities								SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT				22	1			75	93		10.1111/sode.12011			FEB 2013	2013	Role-play (i.e., pretending in which children imagine and act out the part of another individual) was assessed with child interviews and parent questionnaires about invisible friends, personified objects, and pretend identities in a sample of 208 young children. Children who engaged in role-play did not differ from other children in age or vocabulary comprehension. However, they were better able to generate a pretend conversation than other children and were rated by their parents as less shy. The overall pattern of results suggests that the capacity to interact with imaginary others (in and out of the lab) is more closely associated with individual differences in personality than developmental level.									2	0	0	0	2	0961-205X		WOS:000313723400005

Two experiments show that, given the same experienced facts of reality, future imagination may differ from past reconstruction. When participants failed a task, their counterfactual thoughts focused on uncontrollable features of their attempt (e.g., "Things would have been better if the allocated time were longer/if I had better logic skills"). But their prefactual thoughts focused on controllable features of their ensuing endeavor (e.g., "Things will be better next time if I concentrate more/if I use another strategy"). This finding suggests that compared with prefactual thinking, counterfactual thinking may be less subject to reality checks and less likely to serve preparatory goals.									0	0	0	0	0	0096-3445		WOS:000314193600005	22468671

Through a visual and textual discourse analysis of materials related to the event, as well as a series of interviews with participants, promoters, judges and audience members, I argue that these male participants articulate a distinctly masculinized form of South Sudanese nationalism. They do so by promoting notions of both a shared, militarized and oppressive past and a peaceful, proud and celebratory future. Central to the production of this nationalist imaginary is an emphasis on the healing of past ethnic-regional conflicts within the South and an image of South Sudanese unity and brotherly, non-violent masculinity. However, whilst pageantry emcees, speakers and musicians call on men to build and nurture the New South Sudan', the event itself emerges as a site for conflict both online and in incidences of physical violence amongst young male attendees. Members of the community understand this conflict to be bound up with a sense of ethnic-regional allegiance as well as a collective crisis experienced by many young men following the war and amidst the challenges of life in the diaspora. In this way, the pageant works to promote South Sudanese nationalism through the efforts, performances and bodies of young men and the scripting of peaceful nationalist masculinities even as these are contested and contradicted behind the scenes.									0	0	0	0	0	0966-369X		WOS:000315022300006		
J	Wetzstein, Steffen								Globalising Economic Governance, Political Projects, and Spatial Imaginaries: Insights from Four Australasian Cities								GEOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH				51	1			71	84		10.1111/j.1745-5871.2012.00768.x			FEB 2013	2013	This paper explores how territorial economic governance is discursively constituted in a globalising and neoliberalising world. It acknowledges both the increasingly recognised formative role of spatial imaginaries in economic interventions and the workings of co-constitutive political projects that link particular imaginaries with political ambitions and policy strategies. Embracing recent calls for comparative ethnographic urban research at the local-global interface, it explores currently dominant spatial imaginaries across the four Australasian cities of Auckland, Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth. Based on multiple qualitative methods, this study claims that a considerable number of actor's spatial associations and reference points can be related to particular city-specific governmental projects; Auckland's Super-City, Sydney's Global and Green City, Melbourne's Liveable City, and Perth's Vibrant City. It is demonstrated how discursive governance techniques such as story-telling', benchmarking, and policy transfer have been pivotal in the activation, circulation, and performance of those spatial imaginaries and their transformation into temporarily dominant visions for strategic urban interventions aimed at repositioning urban actors, spaces, and activities. While spatial imaginaries can be related to differently framed global aspirations, the effects of spatial political projects on urban governance and investment trajectories differ significantly across space. Theoretically, the paper stresses the importance of particular conceptions of territorial relations and time- and place-specific institutional mediation in shaping context-dependent discursive material governance alignments.									0	0	0	0	0	1745-5863		WOS:000315384900007

Unlike hunger or thirst, it can be satisfied with indirect strategies. Loss of social connection changes the way people usually view nonhuman objects, such as technological devices, personal keepsakes, and pets. Do imaginary creatures, inspired by religious beliefs, media, literature or art, also change their psychological significance as a result of social disconnection? Two experimental studies showed that social disconnection affected the way that imagined beings were created. Lonely people ascribed more supernatural and communal features to their imaginary companions. The images elicited by social disconnection retained significant long-term personal importance as they were persistently experienced as emotionally close. Drawing a link between theories of religious experience and research on anthropomorphism, we propose an integrative view on compensatory attachments.									0	0	0	0	0	0278-016X		WOS:000315676200004

The analysis is based on a sample of eighty-five cross-class romance films released in the 1929-39 period. The films deal with a dilemma evident in the choice of partners: between interests of wealth and social status and the value of romantic, disinterested love, an ideal which had spread throughout the class structure. Gender distinctions are reinforced by narratives in which the wealthy male is redeemed by the poor female so that he can perform the appropriate male gender roles. When the female is wealthy, the poor male insists on her economic dependence on him. Films with gold diggers reached a peak in the early 1930s and provided imaginary solutions to social anxieties about class and gender among both women and men.									0	0	0	0	0	0021-8758		WOS:000314784800037

Within this new scholarship, categories of migrancy are all seen through the same analytical lens. This article and Regimes of Mobility: Imaginaries and Relationalities of Power, the special issue of JEMS it introduces, build on, as well as critique, past and present studies of mobility. In so doing, this issue challenges conceptual orientations built on binaries of difference that have impeded analyses of the interrelationship between mobility and stasis. These include methodological nationalism, which counterpoises concepts of internal and international movement and native and foreigner, and consequently normalises stasis. Instead, the issue offers a regimes of mobility framework that addresses the relationships between mobility and immobility, localisation and transnational connection, experiences and imaginaries of migration, and rootedness and cosmopolitan openness. The introduction highlights how, within this framework and its emphasis on social fields of differential power, the contributors to this collection ethnographically explore the disparities, inequalities, racialised representations and national mythscapes that facilitate and legitimate differential mobility and fixity. Although the authors examine nation-state building processes, their analysis is not confined by national boundaries.									7	0	0	0	7	1369-183X		WOS:000315717500001

Perspectives from Cameroon								JOURNAL OF ETHNIC AND MIGRATION STUDIES				39	2	SI		237	257		10.1080/1369183X.2013.723256			FEB 1 2013	2013	This article argues that both global and national power differences play a crucial role in shaping local imaginaries of international migration among youths in two Cameroonian citiesBamenda and Yaounde. While Yaounde is the national capital, Bamenda is the headquarters of the Anglophone north-west, an area generally opposed to the ruling regime and claiming historical as well as contemporary political marginalisation. Physical mobility has long been associated with social mobility and viewed rather positively. In both areas more critical perspectives on international migration are emerging. This is reflected in differences in envisioned destinations as well as in terminologies and concepts. Thus, in Yaounde the dangers of illegal migration' have become the topic of the daya theme publicised by international organisations in collaboration with local NGOs. Conversely, youths in Bamenda consciously compare their conceptualisations of the advantages and disadvantages of life abroad on the basis of imparted experiences of migrant family members and friends. These discourses influence not only youths' perception of different forms of migrancy but also their assessment of their future in Cameroon. International migration is thus viewed in a broad discursive spectrum from virtue to vice, and perceptions are shaped by regional, national and international political discourse.									0	0	0	0	0	1369-183X		WOS:000315717500004

But, over the last 60 years, the jembe has progressively gone global', and today some master drummers earn a living by teaching jembe workshops to amateur aficionados everywhere. In Asia one week, Europe the next and North America the following, these masters build global social networks, opening and plying the trade routes for the commodification of their roots. In this paper, I describe how the modern fetish for African drumming has created an alternative economy of status for jembe musicians. I examine how, against significantly increasing barriers, young musicians in Guinea are leveraging this economy to follow their elders into global mobility, attempting to achieve a cosmopolitanism through which they, too, can inscribe themselves into West African imaginaries of heroism. And I show how their life paths in turn can allow us to reconsider the notion of cosmopolitan citizenship, in a very unequal world.									0	0	0	0	0	1369-183X		WOS:000315717500007

He argues encounters are always deeply mediated and attitudes shaped by material, technological and symbolic influences with provenances near and remote. This paper targets the sphere of public narratives of encounter, providing two examples of interventions aimed at mobilising sentiment towards ideas of intercultural solidarity and care, and at re-working place identities in ways that highlight multiplicity, interdependency, and intersecting realities.									0	0	0	0	0	1070-289X		WOS:000316065400006

In order to understand these outcomes, we must recognise that diseases acquire durable identities, conditioned by collective imaginaries and institutional contexts when they first come to attention, which bias subsequent decisions, notably about how to balance the value of mandatory testing against the rights of the individual.									0	0	0	0	0	0141-9889		WOS:000316630700007	23517416	
J	Kahn, Paul W.								Imagining Warfare								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW				24	1			199	226		10.1093/ejil/chs086			FEB 2013	2013	War and law enforcement refer to structures of the political imaginary before they refer to legal norms. In this article, I delineate the basic categories through which this framing of political violence takes place: the aesthetics of war, the subjectivity of the combatant, and the ethos of battle. Together, these elements produce a picture of what war is, what it is about, and what sort of rules should govern it. Today, however, the different elements no longer exist in relationships of mutual support. Political violence is no longer between states with roughly symmetrical capacities to injure each other; violence no longer occurs on a battlefield between masses of uniformed combatants; and those involved no longer seem morally innocent. The drone is both a symbol and a part of the dynamic destruction of what had been a stable imaginative structure. It captures all of these changes: the engagement occurs in a normalized time and space, the enemy is not a state, the target is not innocent, and there is no reciprocity of risk. We can call this situation war, but it is no longer clear exactly what that means. The use of drones signals a zone of exception to law that cannot claim the sovereign warrant of war. It represents statecraft as the administration of death. Neither warfare nor law enforcement, this new form of violence is best thought of as the high-tech form of a regime of disappearance. Neither Clausewitz nor Kant, but Machiavelli is our guide in this new war on terror.									3	0	0	0	3	0938-5428		WOS:000318099700013		
J	Menezes, Paulo								Tropa de elite: perigosas ambiguidades	Troupe d'élite: de dangeureuses ambigüitées	Tropa de elite: dangerous ambiguities						Revista Brasileira de Ciências Sociais				28	81			63	75		10.1590/S0102-69092013000100005			2013-02	2013	This article aims at discussing the relations between cinematographic image and production of knowledge in shaping a social imaginary that founds and orients interpretations and evaluations about the world and the social phenomena of which it is constituted. It discusses how movies produces a certain form of apprehending social phenomena by means of a complex elaboration of an imaginary that will serve as a basis for seeing the world under a certain framing and on the basis or certain values. In order to materialize this perspective, the film Tropa de Elite, of large national and international repercussion, is taken as object of a concrete analysis in order to examine the artifices and options of the director in constructing characters and structuring the narrative. Such artifices and options allow him to present, as a movies, relational systems and hierarchies that delimit and generalize certain characters and social groups presented in a cohesive and meaningful form, simultaneously eliding the perception of the values orienting the delimitation and the construction of the world as accomplished by the film. In this sense, the article undertakes a disentanglement of such constructions, revealing the values on which they are founded, which end up in orienting the implicit value assessment and, in this case, also the evaluations made by the film, but that it try to avoid making explicit.		Este artigo visa discutir as relações entre imagem cinematográfica e produção de conhecimento na direção da constituição de um imaginário social que funda e orienta interpretações e avaliações sobre o mundo e os fenômenos sociais que o constituem. Discute como os filmes constroem uma determinada forma de apreensão dos fenômenos sociais por meio da complexa elaboração de um imaginário que vai servir de base para que se olhe o mundo sob determinado recorte e a partir de determinados valores. Para materializar esta perspectiva em uma análise concreta, toma-se o filme Tropa de Elite, de ampla repercussão nacional e internacional, para investigar os artifícios e opções de constituição de personagens e de estruturação de narrativa utilizados pelo diretor no sentido de apresentar enquanto filme sistemas relacionais e hierarquias que recortam e generalisam determinados personagens e grupos sociais apresentados ao público de forma coesa e significativa ao mesmo tempo que elidem a percepção dos valores que orientaram o recorte e a reconstrução do mundo nos moldes que o filme realiza. Nessa direção o artigo empreende um destrinchamento destas construções revelando os valores que estão fundando essas construções e que terminam por orientar as valorações e, no caso, também as avaliações que o filme realiza mas que tenta não deixar explícitas.	Le but de cet article est de discuter les rapports entre l'image cinématographique et la production du savoir vers la constitution d'un imaginaire social qui sert de base et qui oriente les interprétations et les évaluations à propos du monde et des phénomènes sociaux qui le constituent. L'article présente un débat sur la façon par laquelle les films construisent une certaine apréhension des phénomènes sociaux par une construction complexe d'un imaginaire qui va servir de base pour un regard sur le monde d'après une certaine perspective et à partir de valeurs établies. Pour matérialiser cette perspective en une analyse concrète, nous prenons l'exemple du film Tropa de Elite (Troupe d'Élite), qui a eu une grande répercussion nationale et internationale. Nous l'utilisons pour étudier les artifices et les options de construction de personnages et de structuration de la narrative utilisées par le directeur en vue de présenter, en tant que film, les systèmes de relations et de hiérarchies qui recoupent et qui généralisent certains personnages et groupes sociaux présentés au public de façon cohérente et significative. Mais, en même temps, ils suppriment la perception des valeurs qui orientent le découpage et la reconstruction du monde suivant les modèles que le film présente. L'article entreprend ainsi un découpage de ces constructions qui révèle les valeurs qui les fondent et qui finissent par orienter les évaluations et, dans ce cas, les estimations faites par le film de façon non explicite.						0	0	0	0	0	0102-6909		SCIELO:S0102-69092013000100005		
J	Zullo, Angelo; Hassan, Cesare; Repici, Alessandro; Bruzzese, Vincenzo								Helicobacter pylori eradication and reflux disease onset: Did gastric acid get "crazy"?								WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY				19	6			786	789		10.3748/wjg.v19.i6.786			FEB 14 2013	2013	Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is highly prevalent in the general population. In the last decade, a potential relationship between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication and GORD onset has been claimed. The main putative mechanism is the gastric acid hypersecretion that develops after bacterial cure in those patients with corpus-predominant gastritis. We performed a critical reappraisal of the intricate pathogenesis and clinical data available in this field. Oesophagitis onset after H. pylori eradication in duodenal ulcer patients has been ascribed to a gastric acid hypersecretion, which could develop following body gastritis healing. However, the absence of an acid hypersecretive status in these patients is documented by both pathophysiology and clinical studies. Indeed, duodenal ulcer recurrence is virtually abolished following H. pylori eradication. In addition, intra-oesophageal pH recording studies failed to demonstrated increased acid reflux following bacterial eradication. Moreover, oesophageal manometric studies suggest that H. pylori eradication would reduce-rather than favor-acid reflux into the oesophagus. Finally, data of clinical studies would suggest that H. pylori eradication is not significantly associated with either reflux symptoms or erosive oesophagitis onset, some data suggesting also an advantage in curing the infection when oesophagitis is already present. Therefore, the legend of "crazy acid" remains-as all the others a fascinating, but imaginary tale. (C) 2013 Baishideng.

J	Cuéllar Torres, Tatiana								Cartografía del papel de los artefactos en la subjetividad infantil: Un caso sobre la implementación de artefactos en educación de la primera infancia								Cuadernos del Centro de Estudios en Diseño y Comunicación. Ensayos					43			231	245					2013-03	2013	The paper approaches the process of construction of the subjectivity in children, where the symbolic, the real and imaginary, are the subject-object relationship. In this building process, physical and social objects are relevant, because the interaction with them, gives the child ideas about its uses, the shape of their signs and their meaning. The construction of subjectivity is embodied by the children through play, individual and collective discourse, verbal and nonverbal, promoting internalization, meaning and reading non-verbal expressions in other children, to support the construction of the self. From this perspective, claims to be defended is that the subject is changing and the need to review the actual context of childhood that is constructed through everyday experiences and expressions of children in a given space. Therefore, this text will find a map on the role of educational materials (devices) in the child's subjectivity; transferring the production of objects, to think the path of individual students through their collective accents.	Este texto nace del interés por el proceso de construcción de la subjetividad de los niños ² , en donde lo simbólico, lo real y lo imaginario, resultan de la relación sujeto-objeto. En este proceso de construcción, los objetos físicos y sociales son relevantes, porque la interacción con ellos, brinda al niño ideas sobre sus usos, la forma de sus signos y su significado. La construcción de la subjetividad se ve materializada por los niños a través del juego, de discursos individuales y colectivos, verbales y no verbales; promoviendo la interiorización, significación y lectura de las expresiones no verbales en los demás niños, como apoyo en la construcción del Yo. Desde esta perspectiva, las afirmaciones que se defienden, son que el sujeto es cambiante y que es necesario revisar el contexto real de niñez que se construye a través de las experiencias y expresiones cotidianas de los niños en un espacio determinado. Por lo tanto, este texto dará cuenta de una cartografía sobre el papel de lo materiales educativos (artefactos)³, en la subjetividad infantil; traspasando la producción de objetos, para pensar la ruta individual de los estudiantes a través de sus acentos colectivos.

The idealists understood that there is much at stake concerning the ontological status of Spinozistic time. If time is essential to motion then temporal idealism entails that nearly everything-apart from God conceived sub specie aeternitatis-is imaginary. I argue that although time is indeed 'imaginary'-in a sense 'no one doubts' as Spinoza says-there is no good reason to infer that bodies, the infinite modes, and conatus are imaginary in the same sense. To avoid this conflation, we need to follow Spinoza (who follows Descartes) in carefully distinguishing between tempus and duratio. Duration is not only real; it has all the structure needed to ground Spinozistic motion, bodies and conatus.									0	0	0	0	0	0046-8541		WOS:000340439700004

Registering a long history of transnational exchange between the two cities, the exhibitions invited a group of New York artists to photograph Amsterdam and a group of Dutch artists to photograph New York. Both exhibitions claimed that seeing the city from these outsider perspectives enabled new and surprising photographs capable of challenging established images of both cities. Interrogating this claim, the article analyses individual artworks and artists, the marketing and staging strategies of the exhibitions, and the urban branding campaigns with which the events were associated.									0	0	0	0	0	1367-8779		WOS:000317748300004

The enclave will not only be studied as a war-ridden place, but more so in order to explore the antinomies of community that stem from an inherent governmentality that was triggered by the territorial prisonhood of the enclave situation. Violence, as we will show, is not an interruption, but an intensified continuation of politics of the politics of community and its dynamics of unity and friction, which bring to the fore questions of the relationality of politics/religion, the boundaries of the political in Sri Lanka's Muslim community as well as in Sri Lanka's fragmented and violence-striven polity more broadly. It will be argued that what is at play is a politics of purification, whereby violence becomes a project of community: violence in the name of purity and an imaginary of community produces antinomies of community, i.e. the paradoxes of unity and friction that transgress political collectives.									2	0	0	0	2	0016-7398		WOS:000314171700005

Whilst populist imaginaries and certain academic understandings of young, disadvantaged, urban males tend to cast them in the role of claiming and violently defending territories, their relationships to space may be considerably more transient and fluid. Within the late-modern 'liquid city' exclusion has cast the young men researched here into migratory practices, where they must negotiate relationships with potentially hostile peers in various parts of the urban environment. Adopting street cultural norms of rugged masculinity, crimino-entrepreneurialism and the recourse to violence can result in the accumulation of 'street social capital'. This can allow disadvantaged young people to secure a sense of existential security, pleasurable experiences, disposable income and a culturally mediated notion of dignity, despite their spatial and socio-economic exclusion.									3	0	0	0	3	1466-1381		WOS:000314479200001

The essay investigates Wooler's adaptation of the well-known eighteenth-century literary ploy of the imaginary Oriental correspondence, and maintains that his Black Dwarf's epistolary communications with Japanese and supernatural addressees challenge the boundaries of Britishness. A mysterious figure, Wooler's character of the Black Dwarf differs from his literary Oriental precedents, but it is precisely this otherness that contributes to his critical authority to puncture British pride and to illustrate the transnational values of truth and liberty.									0	0	0	0	0	1754-0194		WOS:000314470800004

Is it the case, as Said argued, that essentialized, contrastive racist constructions of Islam and Judaism persist over many centuries or is it possible that current affairs globally transmitted violent encounters such as 9/11 or the Gaza Cast Lead operation can transform racist imaginaries about the essential and unchanging nature of protagonists, Jewish and Muslims, and in doing so, unconsciously reverse earlier stereotypes? Depicting three paradigmatic racist folk devils, the paper examines the particular conundrums associated with anti-Zionism and its equation with the new' anti-Semitism. It concludes by exploring the implications of self-critique in seeking peace between Muslims and Jews.									1	0	0	0	1	0141-9870		WOS:000315681300005

This essay critiques the new anti-Semitism' view. Reversing the method that Plato uses in the Republic, the analysis moves from microcosm (an imaginary ride on a London bus) to macrocosm (the Middle East). In the process, the author argues that anti-Semitism is best defined not by an attitude to Jews but by the figure of the Jew'. In the light of the analysis, and bearing in mind the variety of possible reasons for hostility to Israel or Zionism, it is difficult to see how the new anti-Semitism' view can be sustained.									1	0	0	0	1	0141-9870		WOS:000315681300006

The new plan (AGUA) replaces highly contested major river diversion schemes with a new hydro-technical logic, centered on the construction of high-volume desalination plants on the Mediterranean coast as the means to manage Spain's recurrent water crisis. The desalination of seawater has indeed become one of the contested terrains for managing hydro-scarcities. This article teases out the heterogeneous and often conflicting post-1980s assembling of heterogeneous human and nonhuman agents around desalination as a new socioecological fix for Spain. The broader intellectual objective of the article is, first, to explore how diverse political projects, social visions, the materialities of water, ecological concerns, cultural imaginaries, discursive formations, institutional practices, and economic strategies of global competitiveness fuse together around specific hydro-technical infrastructures. Second, the article considers how desalination and the networks of actors sustaining its realization mark the transition from a state hydro-structural to a decentralized market environmentalist water framework. The article concludes that the assemblage of socionatural actors around the desalination fix and the mobilization of the seas continues to focus on increasing water supply and reproduces hydro-modernizing development despite affirmations of radical change.									4	0	1	0	4	0004-5608		WOS:000315383200003

The post-1978 Dengist reforms of opening up and market liberalisation have led to conditions in which scientists are open to international scientific collaborations. The need to push science and their careers forward has led scientists to accept and experiment with conditions that facilitate international scientific collaborations even before they are developed. This form of 'latent collaboration' leads to dependency on international regulatory decisions, while its embedding invites the flexibilisation of bioethics. Drawing on fieldwork and interviews with over 40 scientists in China between 2006 and 2008, this article shows how scientists uphold particular bioethical guidelines while keeping in mind the possibility of working together with imaginary or potential collaborators.

J	Qadir, Ali								Between secularism/s: Islam and the institutionalisation of modern higher education in mid-nineteenth century British India								BRITISH JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION				35	2			125	139		10.1080/01416200.2012.717065			MAR 1 2013	2013	This paper problematises clean distinctions between secular and religious by tracing the history of modern higher education of Muslims in British colonial India. Grounded in the interpretive research tradition and with an empirical focus on the formative mid-nineteenth century, the article argues that relational notions between singular secularism and multiple secularisms best capture this historical trajectory. The institutional imaginary of colonialism constituted a significant milieu that, on the one hand, resulted in British policies in India that were at a tangent to similar developments in England at the time and, on the other, informed Muslim agency in its own institutionalisation of higher education. Muslim educational philosophy, politics and even theology were shaped in a concrete, historical, power-laden context. One of the consequences of this was a peculiar construction of secularism' in relation to Islam again, related but at a tangent to the same notion in Europe. With a view on contemporary Pakistan, it is argued that such relational histories must be accounted for if policy and academic discourse is to move beyond largely stale and unhelpful binaries of Islam vs. Western modernity in religious education.									1	0	0	0	1	0141-6200		WOS:000316058100002		
J	Lescroart, Mark D.; Biederman, Irving								Cortical Representation of Medial Axis Structure								CEREBRAL CORTEX				23	3			629	637		10.1093/cercor/bhs046			MAR 2013	2013	The identity of an object is not only specified by its parts but also by the relations among the parts. Rearranging parts can produce a completely different object, in the same manner as rearranging the phonemes in "fur" can yield "rough." How does the visual system represent the relative positions of parts? Between-part relations can be characterized by specifying the relations between the medial axes (imaginary lines through the centers) of an object's parts. A functional magnetic resonance imaging multivoxel classification study tested whether the medial axis structure is represented in the human visual system independent of part identity and overall object orientation. Stimuli were line drawings of novel 3-part geometrical objects, which differed in the relations between their parts' medial axes (i.e., in their medial axis structures), the geons that composed each object, and the objects' orientations in plane and in depth. In regions of interest throughout visual cortex, a support vector machine classifier was trained to distinguish objects that shared either the same medial axis structures or the same orientations. By the level of V3, different medial axis structures were more accurately classified than different orientations, indicating a change in the representation of shape compared with earlier visual areas.									4	0	1	0	4	1047-3211		WOS:000316275400013	22387761

J	Fruci, Gian Luca								The two faces of Daniele Manin.

Through a plural set of printed and iconographic sources, this article analyses the mediatization and peopolization process involving the figure of Daniele Manin, President of the Republic of Venice of 1848, dying in exile in Paris in 1857, and the romantic adventures of his martyr family'. In particular, the aim of this contribution is, first, to study the construction of Manin's double face: the Frenchified or French republican celebrity and the Italian monarchic icon. Second, the article highlights the tensions of the transnational media dynamics, which involve an appropriation by the French imaginary and a rediscovery by the Italian imaginary, specifically focusing on the the Franco-Italian monument to Manin inaugurated in Turin in March 1861.									0	0	0	0	0	1354-571X		WOS:000316072900003		
J	Sandler, Willeke								DEUTSCHE HEIMAT IN AFRIKA Colonial Revisionism and the Construction of Germanness through Photography								JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY				25	1			37	61					SPR 2013	2013	In 1939, photographer use Steinhoff published a photograph album of her 1937 trip to the former German colonies of Southwest and East Africa. Through a close study of this photograph album, this article elucidates larger themes in the visual culture of post-colonial and National Socialist Germany. The photographs in Deutsche Heimat in Afrika visualize the colonialist imaginary-peaceful but separate racial relations; the German qualities imposed by the settlers on the landscape and in the cities; an expansion of German women's roles that still maintained the traditional realm of family and culture; and the fertility of the African landscape and the next generation of colonial Germans. Steinhoff showed metropolitan Germans the importance of the colonial space through a visual aesthetic that resonated with that of Nazi Germany, thereby combining the fantasy of the past with the ideals of the present to further colonial revisionism in the Third Reich.									0	0	0	0	0	1042-7961		WOS:000315838500003

In contrast to the ideology perspective, this study draws on the narratives of work blogs and interviews with bloggers to suggest that being cynical about work can also give an employee a sense of control and attachment to their own occupational or professional community, while providing distance from corporate culture initiatives. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research about employee cynicism and the expanding possibilities researching cyberspace, which increasingly appears to be utilised by employees.									3	0	0	0	3	0268-1072		WOS:000316574000005

J	Kovacevic, Filip								A Lacanian Approach to Dream Interpretation								DREAMING				23	1			78	89		10.1037/a0032206			MAR 2013	2013	In the century-old history of psychoanalysis, Jacques Lacan was one of its most controversial practitioners. Though found opaque and convoluted by many, Lacan's ideas have transcended the confines of psychoanalytic practice and have since the 1960s been applied to the study of cultural, social, and political processes and phenomena. In this article, the author presents the main aspects of a Lacanian approach to the interpretation of dreams. He examines Lacan's reinterpretation of a crucial dream from Freud's classic work Interpretation of Dreams: Freud's own dream of Irma's injection. He shows the importance of Lacan's conceptualization of the psyche as the structure containing the registers of the Imaginary, the Symbolic, and the Real for the interpretation of this dream. Furthermore, he demonstrates the applicability of a Lacanian approach by interpreting several other dreams: Descartes' 3 dreams, which have determined the development of modern science, and his own dream. The article is intended for all audiences and its aim is to expand the number of theoretical approaches available in the field of dream interpretation.									0	0	0	0	0	1053-0797		WOS:000316844600004

We draw on understandings of global citizenship and cosmopolitanism as processes rather than end points to reveal the contingent and multilayered ways subjectivities evolve and are performed through international volunteering. We particularly explore how faith based and secular imaginaries come together to shape a cosmopolitanism that smoothes over inequality and injustice. We highlight the need to acknowledge the multiple ways global subjectivities are expressed by analysing research diaries kept by the young volunteers. These reveal how volunteers' negotiation of their faith, public imaginaries of development and everyday encounters with inequality, produce instabilities that have significance for thinking about cosmopolitan sensibilities and global citizenship.

J	Keul, Adam								Performing the swamp, producing the wetland: Social spatialization in the Atchafalaya Basin								GEOFORUM				45				317	326		10.1016/j.geoforum.2012.11.021			MAR 2013	2013	Critical geographers of nature have assessed commodification of wetland spaces from top-down political economic perspectives as well as from perspectives of local lived experience. This paper argues that to better understand and critique processes of wetland abstraction and commodification, we must acknowledge on-site, live production of wetlands. Using a performative approach allows for tourism and swamp tour guides to be understood as vital producers of wetland experiences and knowledge. To grasp how swamp tours can act to spatialize and commodity the swamp, I participated in a host of tours in Louisiana's Atchafalaya Basin and collected numerous interviews with tour guides, tourists and locals during the summer of 2010. Cultural and eco-tourism have thrived here in the context of wetland environmental protection and Cajun cultural expression. On tours, guides spatialize the swamp in performances of its nature and culture by positioning themselves as expert insiders who know how the swamp should be developed. As a part of this process of production, exoticism and wildness are reiterated as essential tropes of the geographic imaginary of the Atchafalaya Basin. However, guides also have the ability to resist the exploitation of the swamp and its inhabitants by creatively rejecting any conceptions of the swamp that they see as inappropriate. By observing how wetlands are performed and valued from within the swamp we can further understand the unique local manifestations of swamp culture alongside the generalized abstractions of wetlands that is entailed by their production as commodities.

J	Piper, Nick								Audiencing Jamie Oliver: Embarrassment, voyeurism and reflexive positioning								GEOFORUM				45				348	355		10.1016/j.geoforum.2012.11.025			MAR 2013	2013	This paper explores audience engagements with popular television food media via a focus on UK based celebrity chef Jamie Oliver. One series, Jamie's Ministry of Food (JMOF) is argued to form a common resource around which different audience positions are constructed and performed. This paper draws on focus group and interview data from two stereotypically contrasting UK towns, Rotherham and Tunbridge Wells. The paper identifies three key tropes: embarrassment, voyeurism and reflexive positioning. In Rotherham I show how the formation of embarrassment is premised upon an imagined social relationship between distant audiences, JMOF and an anxiously anticipating subject. In Tunbridge Wells I explore the recursive relationship between Voyeuristic class disgust and subsequent reflexive positioning. I argue that reflexive positioning works through exchanges of public self critique and public media critique in order to attain and maintain a position within a social group. Voyeuristic and reflexive audience positions are argued to be complementary to one another, forming two parts of a wider flexible relationship to media and the social, possessed by those in particular geographical, as well as subject, positions. The ostensible aims of JMOF are the improvement of health and culinary skill and yet these are complicated and interrogated in audience accounts. Matters of a moral nature, including discussions of social class, poverty, disgust, pleasure, and the ethics of spectatorship take prominence. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It advances the idea that leadership identities are imaginary constructions that invariable fail, reiterating a lack of being. Empirical material consisting of interviews with 15 leaders is used to explore the productive role this lack plays. The study suggests that leadership identities are always already subverted by unconscious desire and therefore less powerful than we might think with regard to imposing structures on others, but also much more powerful than we might think as liberating struggles with leaders' imaginary selves.									1	0	0	0	1	0170-8406		WOS:000316686800005

ORGANIZATION				20	2			153	172		10.1177/1350508411435280			MAR 2013	2013	The recent turn to Lacan's work in critically-oriented Organization and Management Theory signals a welcome focus on one of the 20th century's most influential thinkers. This article introduces Lacan's thesis on gender, making a case for its importance for understanding organizations. We discuss two contrasting receptions to Lacan's Seminar XX, from pro-and anti-Lacanian feminists, offer our own interpretation which can be summed up as a Lacanian inspired parody of the phallic signifier, and argue that Lacanian theorists should turn Lacan's ideas back upon them/ourselves to question critically our own positions. Further we review Lacan's seminar XVII and its analysis of four dominant discourses-the university, the master, the hysteric and the analyst. The advantages of the discourse of the hysteric for a Lacanian politics of gender, enabling us to undo our arguments from outside of our own gender and identity, are then identified. We thus advocate conceptual and empathetic (hysterical) bisexuality for critical scholarship within organization studies that already, perhaps unawares, is hysterical. This allows us to avoid, as much as possible, slipping into the frozen and sterile discourse of the master.									3	0	0	0	3	1350-5084		WOS:000317620000001

Globalization of this institution and its logic makes it more and more difficult for the culture of marketing to change.

They are no longer the place of excluded non-subjects, as in some imaginaries and discourses, but rather a cyber-periphery, a place of wealth in poverty fought over by Nike, Globo Network Television, and the State, as well as laboratories for subjective production. The black bodies of the favelas, the possibilities for co-operation without hierarchy, the invention of other times and spaces (on the streets, in dancehalls, LAN centers, and rooftops) are all subjected to forms of appropriation, just like anything else in capitalism. However, the favelas are no longer seen simply as poverty factories, but rather a form of capital in the market of symbolic national and local values, having been able to convert the most hostile forces (poverty, violence, states of emergency) into a process of creation and cultural invention.									0	0	0	0	0	1356-9325		WOS:000319319800003

In this article we adopt a blend of rhetorical devices to present and discuss design fictions. We do this by referring to current discourses around drone technologies. We resituate these in the context of the networked city and the projection of a hybrid rogue drone. She is dissatisfied with her given functions and begins to question her deployment in urban policing. The article is based in the conceptual end of designing such a future city space. It refers to practical, popular and academic materials and citations to argue for the need for openness and clarity at the ideational end of developing design fictions. The text is part of a wider developmental and reflexive design-research process that takes up the speculative in design fictions and related hermeneutic design research.									0	0	0	0	0	1462-6268		WOS:000320083800004		
J	O'Brien, Cormac								Performing POZ: Irish Theatre, HIV Stigma, and 'Post-AIDS' Identities								IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW				43	1	SI		74	+		10.3366/iur.2013.0056			SPR-SUM 2013	2013	This essay interrogates how the theatre of Queer monologist Neil Watkins challenges HIV-stigma, while simultaneously reconciling his Queerness and HIV-positivity with a sense of Irishness. The development of life-saving drugs for the treatment of HIV means that, in certain parts of the world, including Ireland, people are no longer dying from AIDS, but living with HIV. This has given rise to what cultural commentators call a 'Post-AIDS' discourse, whereby a discourse of crisis and death has evolved into one of health and typical life expectancy. In terms of being 'post-AIDS', Ireland bifurcates into two paradoxical socio-cultural discourses: that of HIV as a medical event, and that of AIDS as a cultural narrative. And while the discourse surrounding HIV the medical event is progressive and democratic, the cultural narrative of AIDS in Ireland is steeped in stigma, ignorance, and contagion paranoia. This damaging narrative is mirrored and embodied in Irish theatre. Interrogating Irish theatre's contentious relationship with the HIV-positive body reveals persistent themes of absence, hiddenness, illness, and death. Neil Watkins disrupts this dramaturgy of shame by mobilizing HIV-stigma to political effect, disrupting received knowledge and cultural assumptions about the HIV-positive body and its current theatrical placement within an anachronistic discourse of crisis. In earlier monologues such as A Cure for Homosexuality (2005) Watkins blurs the lines between the fictional HIV-positive character and the living performer, engendering a troubling tension for the spectator. With his latest work, The Year of Magical Wanking (2010) Watkins further evolves this space whereby the boundaries between character and performer are completely negated. By journeying through Watkins's 'magical' year of quotidian HIV-stigma and sexual shame, the spectator discovers the roots of such shame and stigma are not only embedded in Irish socio-political structures, but also in a limiting and narrow heteronormative sexual imaginary:									0	0	0	0	0	0021-1427		WOS:000320076500004

I first outline the intensely homosocial and even homoerotic nature of the bardic institution (including typical poet-patron exchanges and representations as well as the danta gra or courtly love poetry), employing Sedgwick's concept of 'male homosocial desire' so as to situate the bardic response to the challenge of early modern colonial authority. I argue that colonialism queers pre-existing male homosocial bonds, prompting a set of powerful, foundational responses that live on in the Irish imaginary, including, on the one hand, powerful ideological consolidations of domestic homosocial bonds and, on the other, obsessively recording of the perversity of colonial power and acculturation, as well as of an Irish manhood troubled and reconfigured in its wake.									0	0	0	0	0	0021-1427		WOS:000320076500011		
J	Yan, Haiping								Inhabiting the City: Tropes of "Home" in Contemporary Chinese Cinema								CHINA REVIEW-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL ON GREATER CHINA				13	1			93	135					SPR 2013	2013	Urbanization has been fueling massive migrations across various regions in China, redrawing its physiognomy as much as patterns of relations among all its inhabitants. Amid such redrawing in the life-world, "home" (Jia), a term referring to the material place and related objects used in family life and a trope evoking a "psychic" sense of belonging, has been gaining ascendancy in and across all the artistic and public media, including contemporary Chinese cinema. By bringing three Chinese films produced in the 2010s into a constellation, this essay traces the distinct ways in which a cinematic aesthetic transpires to significantly reconfigure some of the familiar logics of representation. More specifically, this essay examines how such reconfiguration turns into a critical telescope that variably mobilizes tropes of "home" as differential imaginaries of an "urban China," involving important implications for studies of the arts and their social efficacy, in China and beyond.									0	0	0	0	0	1680-2012		WOS:000321086900004		
J	Araújo, Marta; Maeso, Silvia Rodríguez								A presença ausente do racial: discursos políticos e pedagógicos sobre História, "Portugal" e (pós-)colonialismo	The absent presence of racial: political and pedagogical discourses on History, 'Portugal' and (post)colonialism							Educar em Revista					47			145	171		10.1590/S0104-40602013000100010			2013-03	2013	This article examines how in Portugal, in political discourse and in the educational context, 'race' is part of a game of in/visibility. The racial, being considered as a result from the presence of the "other" from the colony, is therefore naturally irrelevant to the formation of the national-metropolitan space and, more generally, to the notion of "Europeanness". From this analysis, we illustrate the depoliticization of racism through the naturalization of colonialism and the reification of the 'immigrant imaginary'; accordingly, racism is understood as something that happens to "others" - ethno-racially marked - but that does not relate to what "we" are, a "we" that, actually, is never questioned. This paper is divided in three sections: (i) we examine the consolidation of the absent presence of the 'racial' considering how a cycle of silence and consensus has been consolidated by the very initiatives to combat racism - marked by anti-racialism - by global organizations such as UNESCO. We further examine how the dissolution of the 'racial' is being produced by the association between racism and immigration in the contemporary European context, both in politics and in faculty; (ii) we present our empirical work and analysis of contemporary history textbooks in Portugal. We show that debates about history and, more specifically, about the teaching of colonialism and slavery have emptied its political relevance and evaded the 'racial' in the understanding of so-called Atlantic slavery, since the fifteenth to the nineteenth centuries, (iii) finally, we conclude with an analysis of the contours of what we call the "(post) colonial consensus" in Portugal, within a broader context of the emptying of the plausibility of a vocabulary that takes into account 'racial'/racism in contemporary societies.		Este artigo analisa como, nos discursos políticos e no contexto educativo português, o racial se insere num jogo de in/visibilidades, sendo considerado como resultante da presença do "outro" da colónia e, logo, naturalmente irrelevante para a formação do espaço nacional-metropolitano e, de modo geral, para a formação da noção de "Europeidade". A partir desta análise, ilustramos a despolitização do racismo via a naturalização do colonialismo e a reificação do "imaginário imigrante"; neste sentido, o racismo é interpretado como algo que sucede aos outros - etnorracialmente marcados - mas que não diz respeito ao que "nós" somos, um "nós" que, aliás, nunca é questionado. O texto está dividido em três partes: (i) examinamos a consolidação da presente ausência do racial considerando como se tem constituído um ciclo de silêncios e consensos sobre o racial na própria ação de combate ao racismo - marcada pelo antirracialismo - de organizações globais como a UNESCO. Examinaremos ainda como a dissolução do racial está a ser produzida através da associação entre racismo e imigração no contexto europeu contemporâneo, tanto na política como na academia; (ii) analisar-se-á o trabalho empírico e os livros didáticos de história contemporâneos que realizámos em Portugal que mostram como, nos debates sobre a história e, mais concretamente, sobre o ensino do colonialismo e da escravatura, se tem esvaziado a sua relevância política e evadido o racial para compreender a chamada escravatura Atlântica dos séculos XV ao XIX; (iii) finalmente, concluímos com uma análise dos contornos daquilo a que denominamos o "consenso (pós-)colonial" em Portugal, inserido num contexto mais amplo de esvaziamento da plausibilidade de um vocabulário que dê conta do racial/racismo nas sociedades contemporâneas.							0	0	0	0	0	0104-4060		SCIELO:S0104-40602013000100010		
J	Gomes, Mariana S								&;#091;Des&;#093;&;#091;re&;#093;Construcciones del imaginario social <mujer Brasileña> en los discursos turísticos sobre Brasil en Portugal								Estudios y perspectivas en turismo				22	2			216	234					2013-03	2013	This article analyzes the social imaginary "Brazilian women" in tourist discourse about Brazil in Portugal, using archeo-genealogical method, inspired in Michel Foucault framework. It is understood that "Brazilian women" is a social, discursive and performative construction, immersed in power historical relations in which modes of subjectivity are always rebuilt. The analysis is based empirically on interviews with Portuguese tourism journalists and managers of the tourism marketing policy of the Brazilian government; as well as in advertising in the Brazilian Tourism Institute (Embratur) and in the private agencies that sell the Brazil in Portugal. The findings indicate that "Brazilian women" is highly present in an tourism discourse about Brazil in Portugal. In examining this visibility and this enunciate, it becomes obvious the reconstruction of the imaginary of the hypersexualized Brazilian woman, in Portugal. The eroticization of the Brazilian woman is naturalized in a hegemonic discourse, which explains the maintenance of power relations, which seem to be related to a coloniality of knowledge-power, racism and sexism.	Este artículo analiza el imaginario social <Mujer Brasileña> en los discursos turísticos sobre Brasil en Portugal, a través del mapeo arqueo-genealógico inspirado en Michel Foucault. <Mujer Brasileña> es una construcción social, discursiva y performática, inmersa en relaciones históricas de poder y en modos de subjetivación siempre reconstruidos. El análisis se fundamenta empíricamente en entrevistas con periodistas de la prensa turística portuguesa y con gestores de la política de marketing turístico del gobierno brasileño; así como en algunas publicidades del Instituto Brasileño de Turismo (EMBRATUR) y de las agencias privadas que comercializan el destino Brasil en Portugal. Las conclusiones indican que el imaginario <Mujer Brasileña> está muy presente en los discursos turísticos sobre Brasil en Portugal. Al analizar esta visibilidad se observa una reconstrucción hipersexualizada del imaginario <Mujer Brasileña> en Portugal. La erotización de las brasileñas emerge de forma naturalizada en el orden discursivo hegemónico, conformando lo que puede ser dicho y visto, lo que explicita el mantenimiento de las relaciones de poder que parecen estar relacionadas con una colonialidad del saber-poder, el racismo y el sexismo.								0	0	0	0	0	1851-1732		SCIELO:S1851-17322013000200003

Building on a panel discussion at the 2009 Annual Meeting of the Association of American Geographers, we highlight a number of different ways in which this could take place. We suggest three possible interventions: stretching the boundaries of the spaces of the postcolonial; interrogating the spatial connections that are forged between disparate places through migration; and challenging singular or hierarchical notions of identity and/or place. In these ways, we conclude that postcolonial theory can complicate and enhance our understanding of migration, and that attention to migration research could, in turn, facilitate a social turn' for postcolonial geographies.									0	0	0	0	0	1464-9365		WOS:000322632200001		
J	Findlay, Allan; McCollum, David; Shubin, Sergei; Apsite, Elina; Krisjane, Zaiga								The role of recruitment agencies in imagining and producing the "good' migrant								SOCIAL & CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY				14	2			145	167		10.1080/14649365.2012.737008			MAR 1 2013	2013	This paper focuses on representations of labour migrants and interrogates how such imaginaries shape migrant recruitment and employment regimes. The recruitment and employment of labour migrants inevitably involves a range of knowledge practices that affect who is recruited, from where and for what purposes. In particular, this paper seeks to advance understandings of how images of bodily goodness' are represented graphically and how perceptions of migrant workers influence the recruitment of workers to the UK from Latvia. The research described in this paper is based on interviews with recruitment agencies, employers and policy makers carried out in Latvia in 2011. The analysis results in a schema of the filtering' processes that are enacted to produce' the ideal' migrant worker. An important original contribution of this paper is that it details how recruitment agencies, in not only engaging in the spatially selective recruitment of labour from certain places but also drawing socially constructed boundaries around migrant bodies, play a key part in shaping migration geographies both in sending and destination countries.									5	0	0	0	5	1464-9365		WOS:000322632200002

J	Twine, Richard								Is Biotechnology Deconstructing Animal Domestication? Movements toward Liberation								CONFIGURATIONS				21	2	SI		135	158					SPR 2013	2013	It might be assumed that the application of genomics to the production of farmed animals represents a move of acceleration, a broadening and an elaboration of what might be possible in terms of the instrumental shaping of animal bodies to the demands of capital. However, this would be to yield too much to hubristic assumptions about the human control of science and technological innovation, and to discount alternative deployments and provocations of the molecular imaginary. Accordingly, this essay explores the potential of molecular biology to contest an already troubled distinction between wild and domesticated. Within this capability to further undermine the distinction resides a potentially important contribution to the formation of a molecular animal-liberatory imaginary. Although the technique of de-domestication has been discussed in relation to conservation projects, the essay assesses whether it could have a role in the liberation of farmed animals. Adopting a critical perspective toward the imaginary, toward de-domestication, and, indeed, toward assumptions around the meanings of liberation, the essay foregrounds various intersecting notions of temporality as vital both to the explication of biotechnological ambivalence and to the complexities of movements toward animal liberation.									0	0	0	0	0	1063-1801		WOS:000327805900002

We used magnetoencephalography to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of high-gamma (52-100 Hz) activities during top-down and bottom-up visual attentional processes, aiming to extend the findings from functional magnetic resonance imaging and event-related potential studies. Fourteen participants performed a 3-stimulus visual oddball task, in which both infrequent non-target and target stimuli were presented. We identified high-gamma event-related synchronization in the left middle frontal gyrus, the left intraparietal sulcus, the left thalamus, and the visual areas in different time windows for the target and non-target conditions. We also found elevated imaginary coherence between the left intraparietal sulcus and the right middle frontal gyrus in the high-gamma band from 300 to 400 ms in the target condition, and between the left thalamus and the left middle frontal gyrus in theta band from 150 to 450 ms. In addition, the strength of high-gamma imaginary coherence between the left middle frontal gyrus and left intraparietal sulcus, between the left middle frontal gyrus and the right middle frontal gyrus, and the high-gamma power in the left thalamus predicted inter-subject variation in target detection response time. This source-level electrophysiological evidence enriches our understanding of bi-directional attention processes: stimulus-driven bottom-up attention orientation to a salient, but irrelevant stimulus; and top-down allocation of attentional resources to stimulus evaluation.									2	0	2	0	2	1932-6203		WOS:000316546400073	23555852	
J	Nayak, Srila								"Nothing in that Other Kingdom": Fashioning a Return to Africa in Omeros								ARIEL-A REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ENGLISH LITERATURE				44	2-3			1	28					APR-JUL 2013	2013	What are we to make of Achille's imaginary return to Africa in Derek Walcott's Omeros? Is it a rejection of Walcott's earlier theme of postcolonial nostalgia for lost origins? Does it lead to a different conception of postcolonial identity away from notions of new world hybridity and heterogeneity that Walcott had espoused earlier, or is it a complex figuring of racial identity for the Afro-Caribbean subject? My essay answers these questions through a reading of the specific intertextual moments in the poem's return to Africa passage. The presence of allusions and textual fragments from Virgil's Aeneid, Homer's Odyssey, and James Joyce's Ulysses in this particular passage of Omeros (Book 3) has not received much critical attention so far. Through the use of these modular texts, I argue that Omeros not only transforms the postcolonial genre of a curative return to origins and fashions a distinctive literary landscape but also imagines a postcolonial subjectivity that negotiates the polarity between origins and the absence of origins or a fragmented new world identity.									0	0	0	0	0	0004-1327		WOS:000334259300001		
J	Van der Tuin, Iris								Non-reductive continental naturalism in the contemporary humanities: Working with Helene Metzger's philosophical reflections								HISTORY OF THE HUMAN SCIENCES				26	2			88	105		10.1177/0952695113480975			APR 2013	2013	This article engages with the philosophical reflections of the French historian of science Helene Metzger (1886-1944) in order to develop a vocabulary for understanding the rise of non-reductive Continental naturalism in the contemporary humanities. The bibliography of current naturalist approaches in the arts and the human sciences is still in the making, but it is altogether clear that the trend is not scientist or historicist or relativist. This epistemological diagnosis refers us to Metzger, who found herself surrounded with the logical positivism of the Wiener Kreis, on the one hand, and the historicism of her French colleagues, on the other, as well as with the infiltration of the history of science by a chronological empiricism. In this article I will take the most recent book of Vicki Kirby - Quantum Anthropologies: Life at Large from 2011 - as an exemplary case of non-reductive Continental naturalist scholarship in the humanities today and by reading it through the concepts of Metzger, I will demonstrate how this type of research leads to refreshing insights in what constitutes positive humanities knowledge and what is the role of the a priori in the field.									0	0	0	0	0	0952-6951		WOS:000317681900005

The initiative to construct the new capital by the government of Juscelino Kubitschek was the object of fierce controversy, dividing public opinion, besides being challenged by the National Democratic Union UDN (main opposition's party). Initially, we investigate social uses and appropriations of popular music to criticize JK's project. Then, we examine the affinities between humor magazine and mainstream media, sharing the opposition to the federal government, as well as the defense of liberal political culture. Hereafter, we analyze the musical controversy about Brasília, involving different subjects, genres and social practices. At last, by evaluating the iconographic series, we study disputes over social imaginary of the new city, reinvented as negative utopia, the distopia Brasiliæ.

J	Garcia, Magaly Rodriguez								Constructing Labour Regionalism in Europe and the Americas, 1920s-1970s								INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SOCIAL HISTORY				58	1			39	70		10.1017/S0020859012000752			APR 2013	2013	This article provides an analysis of the construction of labour regionalism between the 1920s and 1970s. By means of a comparative examination of the supranational labour structures in Europe and the Americas prior to World War II and of the decentralized structure of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), I attempt to defend the argument that regionalism was a labour leaders' construct that responded to three issues: the quest for power among the largest trade-union organizations within the international trade-union movement; mutual distrust between labour leaders of large, middle-sized, and small unions from different regions; and (real or imaginary) common interests among labour leaders from the same region. These push-and-pull factors led to the construction of regional labour identifications that emphasized "otherness'' in the world of international labour. A regional labour identity was intended to supplement, not undermine, national identity. As such, this study fills a lacuna in the scholarly literature on international relations and labour internationalism, which has given only scant attention to the regional level of international labour organization.									0	0	0	0	0	0020-8590		WOS:000316071000003

The philosophy of Charles Taylor has been a major source in the development of contemporary hermeneutics, through his ontological and epistemological articulations of the human sciences. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that Taylor's ideas can further enrich hermeneutic inquiry in nursing research, particularly for investigations of ethical concerns. The paper begins with an outline of Taylor's hermeneutical framework, followed by a review of his key ideas relevant for ethics research. The paper ends with a discussion of my empirical research with critically ill children in Canada and France in relation to Taylor's ideas, chiefly Social Imaginaries. I argue that Taylor's hermeneutics provides a substantive moral framework as well as a methodology for examining ethical concerns.									1	0	0	0	1	1466-7681		WOS:000316218300003	23480035

We explored subjective reports regarding the communicative relationship with parents and the implicit behavioral and neural responses of patients toward stimuli that referred to parents. Fourteen outpatients with schizophrenia and 15 healthy volunteers with living parents were scanned using a functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing an imaginary sentence completion test that involved contemplation of their mothers and fathers. In patients with schizophrenia, subjective reports of better communicative fluency with one's mother were associated with faster response time and lower incomplete rate, reflecting favorable responses toward mothers. Relative to control participants, patients with schizophrenia demonstrated greater neural activation in the superior temporal sulcus and the parahippocampal gyrus for parental stimuli. When patients with schizophrenia contemplated their mothers, activities in these regions were associated with a level of negative symptoms or affective ambivalence in patients. The results indicated that parental cues are processed in a more socially driven manner, and that perceived communicative relationships with one's parents can be used to estimate implicit responses, especially in relation to mothers in patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, the findings of the current study suggest that affective ambivalence toward one's mother is one such implicit response and emphasize the importance of prudent family interventions in the psychiatric rehabilitation of patients with schizophrenia.									1	1	0	0	2	0940-1334		WOS:000316816100011	22678652	
J	Moore, Kerry								'Asylum shopping' in the neoliberal social imaginary								MEDIA CULTURE & SOCIETY				35	3			348	365		10.1177/0163443712472090			APR 2013	2013	This article critically explores the construction and discursive role of 'asylum shopping' in the cultural politics of asylum in the UK. Despite the unusual combination of a concept predominantly associated with consumerism with one largely associated with human rights or sanctuary, the expression 'asylum shopping' has featured in the mainstream news media and political discourse surrounding asylum and refugee issues since the early 1990s. Drawing upon cultural studies theory, post-Marxist discourse theory and critical discourse analysis, the article argues that the naturalisation of this term has been conditioned by the operation of powerful logics underpinning fundamental insecurities in the identity of the national and neoliberal subject - logics associated with Britain's postcoloniality on the one hand and its neoliberal modernity on the other. While the erosion of collective models of solidarity in favour of entrepreneurialism of the self have provided conditions of possibility for an overwhelmingly negative asylum discourse, outrage at asylum seekers' perceived agency and choice of destination encoded in the notion of 'asylum shopping' have been indexed to nostalgic longings for a more secure national or social identity, as well as deep-seated fears and uncertainties about future prospects in the neoliberal subject.									0	0	0	0	0	0163-4437		WOS:000317361000004

With a focus on value codes for immigrants, I argue first, that recent debate on accommodation of immigrants and religious minorities resuscitates the dominant historical narrative of Quebec's fragility as a conquered settler colonial nation but where the major threat is defined as the cultural otherness of racialized immigrants and religious minorities. Second, such value codes instantiate a form of governmental strategy that combines neo-liberal and communitarian rationalities and insist on cultural assimilation as the price of entry into Quebec citizenship. Finally, the paper examines how Quebec's current national imaginary of the worrier nation' maps spatially onto the urban-rural divide.									2	0	0	0	2	0258-9346		WOS:000317268200009

I show how Merleau-Ponty develops this account of the image in critical response to Sartre and in a way that follows from his own descriptions of what painters do when they paint and of what we experience when we look at their paintings. The investigation of the particular mode of being of images leads to a consideration of the body and Merleau-Ponty's later ontology.									0	0	0	0	0	1387-2842		WOS:000317627400005		
J	Jackson, Mark								Plastic islands and processual grounds: ethics, ontology, and the matter of decay								CULTURAL GEOGRAPHIES				20	2	SI		205	224		10.1177/1474474012454998			APR 2013	2013	Hybrid geographies, 'naturecultures', and post-environmental arguments commonly caution against material essentialism, and typically eschew primordial grounds as foundations for ethics. Attenuating such claims, the following paper argues that, nevertheless, ethical grounds are functions of pre-human material givens. Further, the paper explores how we are temporally bound through these more-than-human processes and agencies. Decay is highlighted as one such ontological process that necessarily privileges itself as a matter of human and ethical concern. To argue this position, two island imaginaries are juxtaposed. By contrasting their materialities of plastic and humus, the paper proposes attending to a processual ground immanent to ethical concern. Desert islands, primordial materials of the immemorial (humus), are contrasted to a built island space proposed to be made from pelagic waste (plastic). The contrast reveals that some ontological processes are always already privileged by materialities temporally subtending specifically human spatio-temporal horizons. The argument invites contemporary hybrid geographies to attend to how spatial materialities are also agentially wrought by temporal processes that shape the emergent objects and trajectories of our thought. It concludes with the claim that an ethical basis lies in attuning to human immanence within more-than-human geo-capacities. Good to think with, islands can be performative materials for this ethical attunement.									0	0	0	0	0	1474-4740		WOS:000317700000006

But the incipient debate on democracy and degrowth suffers from general definitions and limited connections to political philosophy and democracy theory. This article offers a critical review of democracy theory within the degrowth literature, taking as its focal point a relevant debate between Serge Latouche and Takis Fotopoulos. We argue that the core of their contention can be traced back to the relationship between the concepts of democracy and autonomy as defined by philosopher Cornelius Castoriadis, which both authors and generally the degrowth movement consider as one of their theoretical reference points. We show how both Latouche and Fotopoulos hold a misconception of Castoriadis' notions of autonomy, the social imaginary and politics, which in turn limits their cognisance of democracy and hence confuses their debate concerning the possibilities for a degrowth transition within the confines of a liberal parliamentary democracy. With a clarified theoretical understanding of the interconnected democracy-autonomy assemble, we proceed to an evaluation of the revolutionary potential of the degrowth movement and to a better understanding of a possible relationship between democracy and degrowth.									4	0	1	0	4	0963-2719		WOS:000317533000005

The Teenage Brain: Sensitivity to Social Evaluation								CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE				22	2	SI		121	127		10.1177/0963721413476512			APR 2013	2013	Relative to childhood, peer relationships take on a heightened importance during adolescence. Might adolescents be highly attuned to information that concerns when and how they are being evaluated and what their peers think of them? This review evaluates how continuing brain development-which influences brain function-partially explains and reflects adolescents' attunement to social evaluation. Though preliminary, evidence is mounting to suggest that while processing information relevant to social evaluation and the internal states of other people, adolescents respond with heightened emotional intensity and corresponding nonlinear recruitment of socioaffective brain circuitry. This review highlights research findings that relate trajectories of brain development to social behavior and discusses promising avenues of future research that will inform how brain development might lead adolescents to be sensitized to social evaluation.									15	0	8	0	15	0963-7214		WOS:000318354000009

In play children are freer to express their forbidden and conflicted thoughts. Consequently, one of the best ways for the therapist to enter the child's world is to do so from within the displacement of the play process. For children who cannot play, the therapist's goal is to teach the child to use play as a means of communication and to create meaning. This article present clinical examples to illustrate how the author uses play in the clinical situation.									1	0	0	0	1	1056-4993		WOS:000318530200005	23538013

Gautier's poem presents a stereotyped image of a Manola (a young working-class woman from Madrid) in a manner that references music and performance both explicitly (in its content) and implicitly (in its structure and realization). Falla's setting accentuates these qualities, its allusions to authentic Spanish idioms resulting in a song that self-consciously evokes a specific performance event (albeit an imaginary one). This essay explores the language, structure and content of Gautier's poem, and investigates Falla's response to it through musical analysis, consideration of cultural and biographical contexts, and comparison with the other two songs in the set.									0	0	0	0	0	1478-7318		WOS:000319817800002

From 1833 to her retirement in 1853, J.J., a self-supporting and mature divorcee living alone, presented herself as a jeune fille who lived at home with her parents and corresponded about the latest fashions and trends with an anonymous and imaginary reader. This article argues that, in spite of the journal's markedly conservative tenor as a vehicle for promoting respectable femininity and its explicit aim to prepare young girls for bourgeois marriage, the columns of its principal spokeswoman can be read as the expression of an alternative agenda centred in female sociability and autonomy. Analysing fashion plates and sewing patterns alongside sample columns from the twenty-year span of J.J.'s 'Correspondance', the article traces the idea of literal and figurative 'reflectivity' to investigate J.J.'s mixing of surface and subtextual messages.									0	0	0	0	0	0263-9904		WOS:000320114000002

This feminization of the displacement is deeply related with a change of the gender relations lived by these women both in Brazil and in host society. In Madrid, Brazilian women are protagonists of a new kind of entrepreneurship. They run small businesses in the field of restoration and of aesthetics and beauty. Nevertheless, they are most commonly employed in low-paid jobs, generally related with domestic services and child/elder care, and with prostitution - being in many cases associated with a stereotype of hyper-sexuality that influences the economic niches they can or can't access. The aim of this paper is to analyze the economic roles of Brazilian immigrants in Madrid, also discussing the imaginaries of the host society with which they dialog to make their economic insertion feasible in Spain.	Las mujeres componen el 65% de la inmigración brasileña en España. Esta feminización del flujo migratorio se vincula a la transformación de las relaciones de género vividas por estas mujeres en Brasil y en la sociedad de acogida. En Madrid, observamos una gran cantidad de negocios regentados por brasileñas - pequeños emprendimientos del campo de la hostelería o de estética y belleza. Sin embargo, ellas son más comúnmente empleadas en sectores no calificados con baja remuneración - en general relacionados a los servicios domésticos y al cuidado de niños y ancianos y la prostitución - , siendo en muchos casos asociadas a un estereotipo de hipersexualidad que influencia los nichos económicos a los que pueden o no acceder. El presente artículo analiza el rol económico que estas mujeres ocupan, y el conjunto de estereotipos raciales/nacionales con los cuales dialogan para lograr construir su inserción económica en España.								0	0	0	1	1	0104-026X		SCIELO:S0104-026X2013000100009

We are particularly interested in the effects of the discoveries and controversies of the diffusion of results of the research process in social imaginary. Through the mass media divulgation -specially press, mainly the magazines having as its objective the scientific research diffusion, an ensemble of rules about the way of conducting "normal" live all along its phases is communicated to the society as a whole. Our main questions are about to the influence of scientific culture, and the social effects of the normative nature of this kind of knowledge in present days. The scientific science, particularly the biosciences, has not only an intellectual power over public opinion and the other forms of knowledge present in contemporary society, as a moral power of conviction. People are convinced to behave as the bio scientific discourses proposes or their lives will be in danger, by their own fault. Respect to other forms of knowledge existing in present culture, no dialogue is actively proposed unless these forms show some "scientific evidences", which can demonstrate their "veracity" . We are worried about the dialogue capacity of this kind of producing facts and its verification, with traditional ways of knowing and conduction life, not only the ancient or oriental ways, but also the popular and alternative forms of knowing and conducting life in occidental contemporary culture since the seventies of last century.		O artigo trata essencialmente do papel das biociências, visto como uma cultura específica, no imaginário social contemporâneo, no que concerne à vida, à saúde e ao viver humano em todas as suas fases. Os meios de comunicação, sobretudo através da imprensa de divulgação de massa - sendo privilegiada no artigo a imprensa escrita - difundem para o conjunto da sociedade modos de pensar e agir derivadas das atividades científicas, em andamento ou finalizadas, na área das biociências, que compõem um campo disciplinar especializado de amplo espectro. Destacamos no texto a autoridade não apenas intelectual como moral do discurso normativo oriundo dessas atividades, face a outros discursos presentes na cultura, sejam eles tradicionais - de origem nativa ou externa, como as orientais - sejam eles paralelos atuais, como os das chamadas medicinas ou saberes terapêuticos alternativos derivados dos movimentos de contracultura que remontam aos anos setentas. Nossa hipótese é que esta influência normativa atinge áreas do viver e setores cada vez mais amplos das populações, sendo possível afirmar que as ciências sociais, sobretudo a sociologia, não vêm atribuindo à questão da vida e da saúde humanas a mesma importância que atribui a outros aspectos da vida social, e que é urgente pensar a cultura da vida e do viver veiculada pelas biociências.							0	0	0	1	1	1517-4522		SCIELO:S1517-45222013000100010		
J	Hausberger, Bernd								Viva Villa! How Hollywood Appropriated A Hero and Then Lost It to the World								HISTORIA MEXICANA				62	4			1497	+					APR-JUN 2013	2013	This paper seeks to reconstruct the reception of Viva villa! - an American movie about revolutionary leader Francisco Villa - in different parts of the world between 1934 and 1940. It is evident that the film found followers in many places, regardless of ideological differences: in National Socialist Germany, in the Soviet Union and, particularly, in Republican Spain. Only in Mexico were official reactions negative. What this paper attempts to evince is the power of modern media - as was cinema at the time - to create through their representations historical imaginaries that, on the one side, have a global reach but, on the other, acquire their meaning in their place of reception through a complex interaction - or competition - with existing imaginaries built upon historical experiences and specific political interests.									0	0	0	0	0	0185-0172		WOS:000320900000004

Twelve, skilled, male baseball players (M age = 24 yr., SD = 4) participated in the study. Participants were instructed to hit a baseball off a tee 0.8 m from the ground (Hitting condition), and also to deliberately swing just above the ball (Air Swing condition). The task for the participants was to perform, in alternate order, 15 swings at a real baseball on a stationary tee and 15 swings at an imaginary ball that was said to be on top of the real baseball. The participants were instructed to hit the ball toward center field just as they would hit in a game. While most participants could hit the real ball in the sweet area of the bat, only one participant did so in the Air Swing condition. Average distances from the center of the sweet area to ball center at the moment of ball-bat contact in the Air Swing condition (85 mm) were significantly greater than the distance in the Hitting condition (38 mm). The larger error in hitting an imaginary ball in the sweet area could be due to perceptual changes following the batter's altered focus, expectation of a lack of contact, and/or lack of feedback from the swing. It was suggested that baseball batters should be aware of the possible error in hitting accurately when they intentionally shifted the target.									0	0	0	0	0	0031-5125		WOS:000322441300020	24032335

So, in this paper, we propose to reflect on the central role that possess cultural heritage and collective representations in contemporary planning, in order to strengthen and restore local territorial identity in a more democratic and inclusive framework. For this purpose, we analyze the different imaginaries in the waterfront of the Paraná River in the city of Rosario - Argentina-, as a representative sample of a problem common to other Latin American cities; in order to provide keys and research perspectives that can be applied to other cases of study.

These adaptive dynamicsof traditional and alternative territories are expressed in hybridisms of practicesand social representations, modern and traditional, about reproductive attributesof nature: nature’s fertility in the traditional territories subsumes the complex socio-environmental reproducibility, while the imaginary of nature in modern scientificculture subsumes objectified productivity of ecosystems. In other words, it is aboutinterpreting narratives and politics of nature. Indeed, understanding the complexityof socioterritorial reproduction of agriculture and traditional fishing, and alternatives(such as those of family farming with ecological bases), subsumes, therefore, theinseparability between the objective and subjective aspects of reprodutibility ofthe productive system lato sensu, this is, of local geo-ecological conditions,traditional values and symbols, which are synthesized in adaptation strategies andresilience of rural communities against the project of (re)territorialization of capital over those counter-hegemonic territories.	Se parte de la idea de que las territorialidades contrahegemónicas en el mundo rural son resultantes de un doble proceso de aprendizaje y/o adaptación: uno interno al próprio territorio, resultante de lacoevolución entre ecosistemas y comunidad, y otro externo y entre territorios-lo que involucra los procesos de territorialización del capital sobre territoriostradicionales. Estas dinámicas adaptativas de los territorios tradicionales y alternativos son expresadas en hibridismos de prácticas y representaciones sociales, modernas y tradicionales, acerca de los atributos reproductivos de lanaturaleza: la fertilidad de la naturaleza en los territorios tradicionales subsume la reproductibilidad del complejo socioambiental, mientras que el imaginariode naturaleza en la cultura científica moderna subsume la productividadobjetivada de los ecosistemas. En otros términos, se trata de interpretar narrativas y políticas de naturaleza. En efecto, el entendimiento de la complejidadde la reproducción socioterritorial de la agricultura y pesca tradicionales, yalternativas (como aquellas de la agricultura familiar de base ecológica),subsume, por tanto, la indisociabilidad entre los aspectos objetivos y subjetivos da la reproductibilidad del sistema productivo lato sensu, o sea, de los condicionantes geoecológicos locales, de los valores y simbolismos tradicionales, que son sintetizados en las estrategias de adaptación y resiliencia de lascomunidades rurales frente al los proyectos de (re)territorialización del Capital sobre aquellos territorios contra-hegemónicos.

Unless exacted by power or force, coordination in humans relies on a common understanding of the problem [2], which is greatly facilitated by communication [3, 4]. The lack of means of consultation about the nature of the problem and how to solve it may explain why multiagent coordination in nonhuman vertebrates has commonly been observed only when multiple individuals react instantaneously to a single stimulus, either natural or experimentally simulated [5, 6], for example a predator [7, 8], a prey [9, 10], or a neighboring group [11-14]. Here we report how vervet monkeys solved an experimentally induced coordination problem. In each of three groups, we trained a low-ranking female, the "provider," to open a container holding a large amount of food, which the providers only opened when all individuals dominant to them ("dominants") stayed outside an imaginary "forbidden circle" around it. Without any human guidance, the dominants learned restraint one by one, in hierarchical order from high to low. Once all dominants showed restraint immediately at the start of the trial, the providers opened the container almost instantly, saving all individuals opportunity costs due to lost foraging time. Solving this game required trial-and-error learning based on individual feedback from the provider to each dominant, and all dominants being patient enough to wait outside the circle while others learned restraint. Communication, social learning, and policing by high-ranking animals played no perceptible role.									2	0	1	0	2	0960-9822		WOS:000317999500019	23541727	
J	Gosling, Simon G.; Astle, Duncan E.								Directing spatial attention to locations within remembered and imagined mental representations								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				7						154	10.3389/fnhum.2013.00154			APR 25 2013	2013	Spatial attention enables us to enhance the processing of items at target locations, at the expense of items presented at irrelevant locations. Many studies have explored the neural correlates of these spatial biases using event-related potentials (ERPs). More recently some studies have shown that these ERP correlates are also present when subjects search visual short-term memory (VSTM). This suggests firstly that this type of mental representation retains a spatial organization that is based upon that of the original percept, and secondly that these attentional biases are flexible and can act to modulate remembered as well as perceptual representations. We aimed to test whether it was necessary for subjects to have actually seen the memoranda at those spatial locations, or whether simply imagining the spatial layout was sufficient to elicit the spatial attention effects. On some trials subjects performed a "visual" search of an array held in VSTM, and upon other trials subjects imagined the items at those spatial locations. We found ERP markers of spatial attention in both the memory-search and the imagery-search conditions. However, there were differences between the conditions, the effect in the memory-search began earlier and included posterior electrode sites. By contrast the ERP effect in the imagery-search condition was apparent only over fronto-central electrode sites and emerged slightly later. Nonetheless, our data demonstrate that it is not necessary for subjects to have ever seen the items at spatial locations for neural markers of spatial attention to be elicited; searching an imaginary spatial layout also triggers spatially-specific attention effects in the ERP data.									1	0	0	0	1	1662-5161		WOS:000318337600001	23630485

Yet, sociology has traditionally had a poor record of linking disabled people's 'private' accounts of their difficulties to 'public' issues. We contend that disability is still marginal to the sociological imaginary, despite attempts by disability studies and subdisciplines within sociology to make the concept relevant to the larger discipline. There is a range of conceptual tensions in sociology such as public/private and normal/abnormal that can be better illuminated by focusing on disability. We argue that critical disability studies, with its reimagining of disability within late modernity, may be better positioned to make more effectively the case for disability's significance to the sociological imaginary. Facilitating dialogue with sociology on the concept of disability, however, may require disability scholars to develop more explicit strategies of engagement.									0	0	0	0	0	0896-9205		WOS:000209202100004

J	Parker, Ian								PATHOLOGY AND CREATIVITY: A SINTHOMATIC READING OF LACAN'S SEMINAR XXIII								PHILOSOPHIA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY				14	2			233	246					MAY 2013	2013	Jacques Lacan's innovative development of Freudian psychoanalysis entails a differentiation between registers of the "symbolic," "imaginary," and "real," and then an analysis of the way these three registers are held together as three rings of the "Borromean knot." This work is taken a significant step further in his 1975-76 Seminar XXIII, and is sometimes thought to mark the shift to a "later Lacan." The seminar shifts its focus from "symptom" (as a coded message to the Other, repetitively sent even unbeknownst to the subject) to the "sinthome" as a device by which the subject configures and is configured by a little circuit of messages. The Borromean knot is now seen as held together in some circumstances by the "sinthome." In this paper I explore what Lacan has to say about language, the Borromean knot, James Joyce, and God, and then turn to explore the place of symptoms, "sinthomes" and psychoanalysis itself in relation to psychiatry and contemporary culture. This paper is in two parts. In the first I review main lines of argument in Seminar XXIII, and then in the second part I embed Lacan's account in the broader cultural processes in which our clinical work must be read in order to be rewritten.									0	0	0	0	0	2244-1875		WOS:000343849400007		
J	González-Campo, Carlos Hernán; García Solarte, Mónica; Murillo Vargas, Guillermo								Avatar (A'): Contrasting Lacan's Theory and 3D Virtual Worlds.A Case Study In Second Life	Contrastando la Teoría de Lacan y los mundos virtuales en 3D. Un caso de estudio en Second Life							Psicología desde el Caribe				30	2			309	324					2013-05	2013	Abstract Lacan did not propose a totalized subject, but he proposed a divided one whose representation is structured in each interaction with its peers through Saussure's argumentative language. This shows the real, the imaginary or the symbolic as (a), (a') or (A). This study tries to propose and discuss that it is currently possible to establish virtual issues, taking into account social and psychological effects of the cyberspace and the capacity to decide and execute actions. Virtually, the representation is given by the Avatar known as (A'), since it is an evolution of the Other (A). This interaction is being done through the use of language, with the construction of signifieds and signifiers. Signifieds are conceived in the virtual world and signifiers in the real one, but the last one could allow the first one to materialize the Other (A) in the Avatar (A'). Second Life is a metaverse, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), which shows 3D virtual worlds where each subject is able to create its Avatars characterizing its own identity through the subject's desires.	Resumen Lacan no propuso un sujeto totalizado, pero propuso uno dividido cuya representación se estructura en cada interacción con sus pares a través del lenguaje argumentativo de Saussure. Esto demuestra lo real, lo imaginario y lo simbólico como (a), (a ") o (A). Este estudio trata de proponer y discutir que es posible actualmente establecer cuestiones virtuales, teniendo en cuenta los efectos sociales y psicológicos del ci-berespacio y la capacidad de decidir y ejecutar acciones. Prácticamente, la representación es dada por el Avatar conocido como (A ya que es una evolución de las otras (A). Esta interacción se lleva a cabo mediante el uso del lenguaje, con la construcción de significados y significantes. Significados son concebidos en el mundo virtual y significantes en la real, pero el último podría permitir al primero materializar el Otro (A) en el Avatar (A '). Second Life es un metaverso, un juego del rol multi-jugador masivo en línea (MMORPG), que muestra mundos virtuales en 3D en el que cada sujeto es capaz de crear sus avatares caracterizar su propia identidad a través de los deseos del sujeto.								0	0	0	0	0	2011-7485		SCIELO:S0123-417X2013000200006

This paper examines diverse facets of the religious spatiality of Afro-Christian diasporic churchesfrom local emplacement to the more visible public parade of faith in the urban landscape. One of the aims is to explore to what extent particular spatial configurations and locations constitute objective expression' of social status and symbolic positionalities in the post-migration secular environment of the host societies'. Without denying the impact of urban marginality, the paper shows how religious groups such as African Pentecostal and Prophetic churches are also engaged, in their own terms, in a transformative project of spatial appropriation, regeneration and re-enchantment of the urban landscape. The case study of the Congolese Kimbanguist Church in London and Atlanta also demonstrates the need to examine the articulation of local, transnational and global practices and imaginaries to understand how religious and ethnic identities are renegotiated in newly localised' diasporic settings.									4	0	0	0	4	1369-183X		WOS:000316654600001

Numerous scholars now take seriously the place of popular culture in the remaking of our geographies, but video games still lag behind. For us, this tendency reflects a general response to them as imaginary spaces that are separate from everyday life and real' politics. It is this disconnect between abstraction and lived experience that we complicate by defining play as an event of what Brian Massumi calls lived abstraction. We wish to short-circuit the barriers that prevent the aesthetic resonating with the political and argue that through their enactment, video games can animate fantastical futures that require the player to make, and reflect upon, profound ethical decisions that can be antagonistic to prevailing political imaginations. We refer to this as social irrealism to demonstrate that reality can be understood through the impossible and the imagined.									0	0	0	0	0	1464-9365		WOS:000317281600005		
J	Zhang, Yi; Zhao, Yunxin								Real and imaginary modulation spectral subtraction for speech enhancement								SPEECH COMMUNICATION				55	4			509	522		10.1016/j.specom.2012.09.005			MAY 2013	2013	In this paper, we propose a novel spectral subtraction method for noisy speech enhancement. Instead of taking the conventional approach of carrying out subtraction on the magnitude spectrum in the acoustic frequency domain, we propose to perform subtraction on the real and imaginary spectra separately in the modulation frequency domain, where the method is referred to as MRISS. By doing so, we are able to enhance magnitude as well as phase through spectral subtraction. We conducted objective and subjective evaluation experiments to compare the performance of the proposed MRISS method with three existing methods, including modulation frequency domain magnitude spectral subtraction (MSS), nonlinear spectral subtraction (NSS), and minimum mean square error estimation (MMSE). The objective evaluation used the criteria of segmental signal-to-noise ratio (Segmental SNR), PESQ, and average Itakura-Saito spectral distance (ISD). The subjective evaluation used a mean preference score with 14 participants. Both objective and subjective evaluation results have demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed the three existing speech enhancement methods. A further analysis has shown that the winning performance of the proposed MRISS method comes from improvements in the recovery of both acoustic magnitude and phase spectrum. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Lewthwaite, Stephanie								Reworking the Spanish Colonial Paradigm: Mestizaje and Spirituality in Contemporary New Mexican Art								JOURNAL OF AMERICAN STUDIES				47	2			339	362		10.1017/S002187581300011X			MAY 2013	2013	During the early 1900s, Anglo-Americans in search of an indigenous modernism found inspiration in the Hispano and Native American arts of New Mexico. The elevation of Spanish colonial-style art through associations such as the Anglo-led Spanish Colonial Arts Society (SCAS, 1925) placed Hispano aesthetic production within the realm of tradition, as the product of geographic and cultural isolation rather than innovation. The revival of the SCAS in 1952 and Spanish Market in 1965 helped perpetuate the view of Hispanos either as "traditional" artists who replicate an "authentic" Spanish colonial style, or as "outsider" artists who defy categorization. Thus the Spanish colonial paradigm has endorsed a purist vision of Hispano art and identity that obscures the intercultural encounters shaping contemporary Hispano visual culture. This essay investigates a series of contemporary Hispano artists who challenge the Spanish colonial paradigm as it developed under Anglo patronage, principally through the realm of spiritually based artwork. I explore the satirical art of contemporary santero Luis Tapia; the colonial, baroque, indigenous and pop culture iconographies of painter Ray Martin Abeyta; and the "mixed-tech media" of Marion Martinez's circuit-board retablos. These artists blend Spanish colonial art with pre-Columbian mythology and pop culture, tradition with technology, and local with global imaginaries. In doing so, they present more empowering and expansive visions of Hispano art and identity - as declarations of cultural ownership and adaptation and as oppositional mestizo formations tied historically to wider Latino, Latin American and transnational worlds.									0	0	0	0	0	0021-8758		WOS:000317674500033

Taking as its empirical reference the largest favela in Rio de Janeiro, it focuses on how people who are having the opportunity to travel by plane for the first time accommodate three interrelated issues: their willingness to experience an energy intensive way of travelling, their affective and material realities, and their awareness about the changing of the world's climate. The article concludes with some reflections on how to reintegrate global knowing with local meaning around travel and climate change.									2	0	0	0	2	1745-0101		WOS:000317828900001		
J	Smallwood, Jonathan								Distinguishing How From Why the Mind Wanders: A Process-Occurrence Framework for Self-Generated Mental Activity								PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN				139	3			519	535		10.1037/a0030010			MAY 2013	2013	Cognition can unfold with little regard to the events taking place in the environment, and such self-generated mental activity poses a specific set of challenges for its scientific analysis in both cognitive science and neuroscience. One problem is that the spontaneous onset of self-generated mental activity makes it hard to distinguish the events that control the occurrence of the experience from those processes that ensure the continuity of an internal train of thought once initiated. This review demonstrates that a distinction between process and occurrence (a) provides theoretical clarity that has been absent from current discussions of self-generated mental activity, (b) affords conceptual leverage on seemingly disparate results associating the state with both domain-general processes and task error, and (c) draws attention to important questions for understanding unconstrained thought in contexts such as psychopathology and education. It is suggested that identifying the moment that self-generated mental events begin is a necessary next step in moving toward a testable account of why the mind has evolved to neglect the present in favor of ruminations on the past or imaginary musings of what may yet come to pass.									46	0	16	0	46	0033-2909		WOS:000317855200001	23607430

The author argues that, far from telling us about the cultures of poor youth, reality television programs, notably those produced by the BBC, elucidate the agenda of political elites driving "Austerity Britain" to "harden" the views of British citizens against the poor and marginalized. She explores the new harsh realism of Neighbourhood Watched identifying a shift from the earlier left-wing concerns of the British social-realist movement, toward a right-wing sensibility, which has coincided with significant changes to state policy toward the most vulnerable segments of Britain's population.									0	0	0	0	0	1527-4764		WOS:000317815600005

AIDS AND BEHAVIOR				17	4			1362	1369		10.1007/s10461-012-0406-8			MAY 2013	2013	HIV-related risk perceptions and risk practices among gay men have changed over time. We revisited perceived HIV risk and engagement in anal intercourse with casual partners among HIV-negative gay men who participated in one of the Sydney Gay Community Periodic Surveys (GCPS). Perceived HIV risk was assessed by a range of anal intercourse practices combined with pre-specified casual partners' HIV status and viral load levels. Perceived HIV risk forms a potential hierarchy, broadly reflecting differences in the probability of HIV transmission through various anal intercourse practices. To a lesser extent, it also varies by casual partners' HIV status and viral load. Men who had unprotected anal intercourse with casual partners (UAIC) perceived lower HIV risk than those who used condoms consistently in the 6 months prior to survey. Recognising the complex associations between risk perceptions and risk practices helps to better address challenges arising from the 'Treatment as Prevention' (TasP).									1	0	1	0	1	1090-7165		WOS:000318171800016	23314802	
J	Barnes, Trevor J.; Minca, Claudio								Nazi Spatial Theory: The Dark Geographies of Carl Schmitt and Walter Christaller								ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS				103	3			669	687		10.1080/00045608.2011.653732			MAY 1 2013	2013	The concern with space and, more fundamentally, the formulation of a larger, guiding spatial theory, was central to achieving Nazi objectives during the Third Reich. We disclose critical elements of that theory, focusing on two contributions: the first by the jurist and international legal and political theorist Carl Schmitt (18881985) and the second by the geographer Walter Christaller (18931969). Applying the perverted biopolitical logic of National Socialism required the military accomplishment and bureaucratic management of two interrelated spatial processes: deterritorialization and reterritorialization. Deterritorialization involved moving non-Germanized Germans (mainly Jews and Slavs) off conquered Eastern lands to create an empty space that was then reterritorialized by the settlement of legitimate Germans (although often not German citizens). Although many German academics were involved in designing and implementing these spatial strategies, we single out two. Carl Schmitt provided a politico-judicial justification for reterritorialization involving the geographical expansion of the Third Reich: Gro ss raum (greater space). Conceived four months before Germany's Blitzkrieg invasion of Poland that triggered World War II, Gro ss raum provided the (literal) grounds for Nazi reterritorialization. Walter Christaller brought his peculiar spatial imaginary of formal geometry and place-based rural romanticism in planning the empty space of the East after non-Germanized inhabitants were removed. His central place theory re-created the Nazis' territorial conquests in the geographical likeness of the German homeland.									6	0	0	0	6	0004-5608		WOS:000317837800013		
J	Joshi, Shangrila								Understanding India's Representation of North-South Climate Politics								GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS				13	2			128	+		10.1162/GLEP_a_00170			MAY 2013	2013	This paper examines India's role in perpetuating North-South imaginaries in global climate politics. A Global South perspective on climate politics is premised on the differential contribution of developed and developing countries towards climate change, differential adaptive capacities, and the overriding need of developing countries to focus on poverty alleviation and sustainable development. Meanwhile, the North-South binary has been extensively critiqued in the literature for the heterogeneity of each category, narrowing gaps between North and South, and the state-centrism implicit in such a categorization. Based on the understanding that the reproduction of the North-South frame in climate discourses is inherently political, I examine the politics behind their reproduction, rather than focus on the validity of these categories. Based on fieldwork in Delhi and Copenhagen, my paper provides insight into the spatial politics of climate policy negotiations. The categories North and South, developed and developing, or First World and Third World constitute powerful spatial imaginaries that strongly influence the negotiating positions of Indian officials in global climate politics, even as India's image as a developing country is increasingly questioned in light of its status as an emerging economy and major emitter. The self-identification of Indian officials with the imaginary of the Global South is a crucial feature of global climate politics.									0	0	0	0	0	1526-3800		WOS:000318073500007

A model of a neural controller is presented, which allows a humanoid robot iCub to autonomously improve its sensorimotor skills. This is achieved by endowing the neural controller with a secondary neural system that, by exploiting the sensorimotor skills already acquired by the robot, is able to generate additional imaginary examples that can be used by the controller itself to improve the performance through a simulated mental training. Results and analysis presented in the paper provide evidence of the viability of the approach proposed and help to clarify the rational behind the chosen model and its implementation.

In these ebimeeza ('round tables' in Luganda, also called 'people's parliaments') orators are engaged in practices of social distinction when compared to those they call the 'common men'. These spaces of discussion reflect the importance of education in local representations of legitimacy and morality, whether in Buganda 'neotraditional' mobilizations or Museveni's modernist vision of politics. The ebimeeza and the government ban imposed on them in 2009 reveal the entrenchment of the vision of a 'bifurcated' public sphere, the separation of a sphere of 'development' and a sphere of 'politics', the latter being only accessible to educated 'enlightened' individuals - despite the revolutionary discourse and the institutionalization of the Movementist 'grassroots democracy' model in 1986.									0	0	0	0	0	0001-9720		WOS:000318434900002

These alternate visions are largely facilitated by artists and art collectives using urban communities as performative grounds. These projects promote a view of art as an effective channel for 'recentering'-the identification of a multitude of centers that endlessly fracture and shift, very much resembling the nature of cities themselves. An alternate vision of the city through cartography informed by contrast, temporality and ephemerality is proposed alongside dominant representations of the city. Works by artists Alma Quinto, Mark Salvatus and Wire Tuazon are representative examples of such strategies. Diverse in tactics and platforms, defined by site-specific mediations, the projects facilitated by these artists reveal the uneven conditions that beset Metro Manila and its outlying areas. Quinto's altered Urban Plan/Duyan is the result of her engagement with women in an informal settler community in San Andres Bukid, Manila, while Salvatus's web-based Neo-Urban Planner is an astute observation of the obsessive yet futile ordering of people and space by the state. Tuazon's Amphibian installation is a commentary on the encroachment of multinational interests in local communities. These interventions are foils to state-and private-led urban development schemes. Their strength lies in their direct engagement with the sphere of public dialogue and self-determination. These artistic practices and strategies are shaped by community interaction, revealing that meanings residing in urban forms are relentlessly negotiated by the numerous actors that inhabit the city.									1	0	0	0	1	0309-1317		WOS:000318184400004

In La Revolution Urbaine (1970), Lefebvre had already begun hinting at a new reality, not only an urban society, but of planetary urbanization. Today, four decades on, Asimov's extraterrestrial universe seems closer to home than ever, and closer to Lefebvre's own terrestrial prognostications: planetary urbanization is creating a whole new spatial world (dis)order. But how shall we reclaim the shapeless, formless and boundless metropolis as a theoretical object and political object of the progressive struggle? If the arena of politics has no discernible form, what would be the form of these politics? What, exactly, are urban politics? This article tries to rethink theoretically the urban question and the question of urban politics in our era of planetary urbanization, working through the political role of the urban in the light of recent 'Occupy' mobilizations.									4	0	0	0	4	0309-1317		WOS:000318184400007

In so doing, the essay seeks to identify the capacity of Torres Strait literature and storytelling to re-conceive relations of space and time and to acknowledge a spatial and temporal mobility running parallel to the circumscribed trajectories of late modernity.									0	0	0	0	0	1715-2593		WOS:000318743700005

In developing these methods, the letters of the words "order" and "disorder" were inscribed into an A-Z map of the city to provide the outline for these walks. This quest to seek alternative modes of conduct in the everyday life of the city attempts to find access to what Massumi has identified as the transitional qualities of a body-in-motion. In this systematic derangement of the senses, the city gives way to a proliferation of decontexualized objects and fragments that stimulate alternative forms of narrative and possible new political imaginaries. Folding the city in these ways brings into relief a number of important spatial features of Manchester that converge around the concept proposed here as "the interruption of topology." This interruption demands a certain textual innovation that displaces the performative rituals of the academic article while improvising its own "mythologization" of the city.									1	0	0	0	1	1206-3312		WOS:000319348100006

At the heart of this politics is a vision of economic localisation rooted in a geographical imaginary of market towns with agricultural hinterlands. Consequently, the question of how the Transition model can be applied in urban settings has not been clear, leading to the implicit assumption that urban Transition initiatives are more complex and difficult. In contrast, this paper argues that the plasticity of Transition politics means that, in some cases, an urban context might be more productive for the development of Transition initiatives because it allows for a greater diversity of political action as well as providing a density of networks and resources that can be critical for the survival of grassroots interventions.									3	1	0	0	4	0042-0980		WOS:000319130400007		
J	Nyman, Jopi								Reading Melancholia in Abdulrazak Gurnah's Pilgrims Way								ENGLISH STUDIES IN AFRICA				56	1			4	16		10.1080/00138398.2013.780677			MAY 1 2013	2013	This article examines the representation of melancholia in Abdulrazak Gurnah's second novel Pilgrims Way (1988), a story of the hospital orderly, Daud, a disillusioned Zanzibari migrant living a melancholic and marginal life in Britain in the 1970s. The theoretical framework consists of the analysis of the condition of melancholia presented by Sigmund Freud in his Mourning and Melancholia and its later postcolonial applications by such theorists as Anne Cheng, David Eng, and David Kazanjian who examine the concept in the context of race and migration. The essay discusses the representation of melancholia in the novel and addresses its protagonist's attempts to negotiate his position in conditions of migration and race. These include the creation of alternative colonial pasts for the people whom he encounters, his act of writing (imaginary) letters to various real and fictional characters, and the gradual reconstruction of his identity through his attachment to Catherine. The essay suggests that at the core of the protagonist's melancholia are the historical traumas generated by the legacy of colonialism in East Africa, the related loss of family and community, and the disillusion generated by his migration to a racist Britain.									0	0	0	0	0	0013-8398		WOS:000319322200002		
J	Wade, Peter								Blackness, Indigeneity, Multiculturalism and Genomics in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico					2			JOURNAL OF LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES				45				205	233		10.1017/S0022216X13000011			MAY 2013	2013	Genomic research in Latin America has looked into the African, Amerindian and European ancestry of local populations. This article explores how indigeneity and blackness figure in genomic science in the light of previous and current representations of indigenous and Afro-descendent people. These categories have been cast as 'other' in Latin America, but they have occupied different locations in 'structures of alterity'. I look briefly at these similarities and differences in the colonial and republican periods and in recent multiculturalist reforms. I look at the gendered sexual imagery surrounding each concept, before examining in detail how blackness and indigeneity figure in gendered ways in genomic science research on admixture and ancestry in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. I conclude that, in the context of multiculturalism, genomics works to re-centre imaginaries of the nation around the mestizo and mixture, while casting blackness and indigeneity, in sexualised and gendered ways, as different kinds of others.									1	0	1	0	1	0022-216X		WOS:000318934100001		
J	Bestebreurtje, Frank Peter								Limits of Reason and Limits of Faith. Hermeneutical Considerations on Evolution Theology								NEUE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SYSTEMATISCHE THEOLOGIE UND RELIGIONSPHILOSOPHIE				55	2			243	257		10.1515/nzsth-2013-0014			MAY 2013	2013	In the science-religion debate, both scientific and theological approaches suffer from an abstract conception of time and history. This is epitomised by evolution theory and by theological trends trying to match it with biblical and Christian doctrines. On the one hand, thinking in millions of years voids time of any sensible meaning; on the other hand, thinking Darwin and the Bible together compromises both in regards to history. The notion of the "imaginary", drawn from Charles Taylor's A Secular Age, helps to circumscribe some of the hermeneutical gaps involved, and enables a more nuanced assessment of the respective claims made in the debate. The "Imaginary" points to the necessity of reflecting on the status of one's own thought in regard to the past. In that sense, both evolution theory and evolution theology are confined to what one may call the "modern imaginary". An example of the mismatch between evolution theory and Christian doctrine is found in Alvin Plantinga. As the debate largely hinges on hermeneutics, this contribution is part of a broader endeavour to redefine hermeneutics as an ethics.									0	0	0	0	0	0028-3517		WOS:000319568000007		
J	Gorman-Murray, Andrew								Urban Homebodies: Embodiment, Masculinity, and Domesticity in Inner Sydney								GEOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH				51	2			137	144		10.1111/j.1745-5871.2011.00750.x			MAY 2013	2013	Gender is a key lens for interpreting meanings and practices of home(making) in urban neighbourhoods, but while there is a rich understanding of women's experiences, there is a paucity of work on men's. To advance insights into gendered dimensions of home in urban contexts, this paper discusses men's embodied experiences of home in inner Sydney, drawing data from fieldwork with 52 men. This focus is prompted by scholarly and policy concern with men's emotional wellbeing. I seek to understand how these men deploy their homes to pursue work/life balance and how domestic activities contribute to their emotional wellbeing. I find that these men use their bodies as emotional and sensuous instruments to manage the interplay of work(place) and home(place). Moreover, I suggest that these men's embodied emotional engagements with domesticity reconfigure the gendered practices and imaginaries of homelife, and challenge persistent gender inequalities and stereotypes by providing alternatives to hegemonic masculinity.									3	0	0	0	3	1745-5863		WOS:000319835700004		
J	Pilkey, Brent								LGBT Homemaking in London, UK: The Embodiment of Mobile Homemaking Imaginaries								GEOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH				51	2			159	165		10.1111/j.1745-5871.2012.00752.x			MAY 2013	2013	A stimulating body of work, which sits at the intersection of feminist and queer geographies, argues that embodied performativity can not be separated from the study of home. This paper seeks to expand on this work by looking closely at spatial mobility and homemaking imaginaries of lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) Londoners. Specifically, I focus on two separate yet related locations in the production of home: the parental home and the home established in adulthood. The paper argues that for LGBT Londoners, both sites play an important, complex role whereby homemaking identity is shaped through the tension or push and pull of these two locations. The parental home can be an isolated space where one's sexual identity remains, if not closeted, then modified. Often, one flees the home in the process of coming out', and identity is expressed differently in the new home. Given this departure, arrival, and return (to visit), how does the parental home relate to one's current identity and homemaking practices? The research for the paper is drawn from eight semi-structured interviews conducted with Londoners. Using this research and the physical and emotional embodiment framework, I also draw parallels with Blunt's theme of productive nostalgia', whereby both the physical spatial embodiment as well as the narrative of imagination - in past (as in conventional understandings of nostalgia), present, and future - act as a lens to understanding the homemaking of LGBT Londoners.									1	0	0	0	1	1745-5863		WOS:000319835700007		
J	Rizvi, Fazal								Equity and marketisation: a brief commentary								DISCOURSE-STUDIES IN THE CULTURAL POLITICS OF EDUCATION				34	2	SI		274	278		10.1080/01596306.2013.770252			MAY 1 2013	2013	Beginning with a reflection on the Participation and Equity Program (PEP) in Australia in the 1980s, this response describes the distinctive ideological shift from a social democratic to a market conception of equity in education over the past three decades. This shift has been accompanied by changes in the techniques of educational governance, from the collaborative approach of the PEP, which emphasised the importance of trust in teachers as professionals, to new managerialism focused on efficiency and accountability. Market reforms in education have continued to use such traditionally socially democratic notions as equity, but have been enormously successful in re-articulating their meaning. A commentary is provided on the papers in this Special Issue and their collective analysis of governmental strategies that have led to this re-articulation of equity; the extent to which these strategies have been successful; the consequences they have had on students and school communities, and for the work of teachers and schools; and possibilities for creating new approaches in education that undermine the seemingly hegemonic neo-liberal imaginary and work towards a more progressive democratic view of educational equity.									2	0	0	0	2	0159-6306		WOS:000320184300009		
J	Sitas, Rike; Pieterse, Edgar								Democratic Renovations and Affective Political Imaginaries								THIRD TEXT				27	3	SI		327	342		10.1080/09528822.2013.798183			MAY 1 2013	2013	Both the state and radical civil actors tend to perceive and define ordinary citizens in circumscribed ways; as rational actors who need to be persuaded through rational argument about why their participation is necessary for the democratic functioning of society. The assumption is that once people have been exposed to compelling arguments and incentives, they will activate their engagement with politics. Despite South Africa's embracing of participatory democracy, a chasm has emerged between policy ambitions and democratic practices. It is against this backdrop that the authors explore more closely how citizenship and political enrolment can be forged despite the stultifying political cultures that presently predominate. Using examples from the Two Thousand and Ten Reasons to Live in a Small Town public art project, this article looks at the potential of inclusionary public art practices as a means to inspire new affective forms of political enrolment. We argue that through transgressive aesthetics, public art can enable an experimental politics that has important implications for transformation, especially for future citizens.									0	0	0	0	0	0952-8822		WOS:000320498900004

Nevertheless, there is little agreement on what kinds of processes the terms "transnationalism" and "globalization" refer to and to what extent they represent something new. As the articles in this special issue examine, however, these terms refer not simply to actual changes in geographical scale but to distinct ways of imagining the world and specific claims about how the world should be. This introduction discusses the ways that the contributors to this issue attend to the role that the transnational imagination plays in religious discourse and practice.									0	0	0	0	0	1092-6690		WOS:000319890600001

This article considers the Valley as an example of the interrelations between religion and globalization, exploring how conceptual changes associated with contemporary processes of globalization such as time-space compression and deterritorialization function as structuring elements within the religious imaginary laid out by the Valley's founders in the 1960s and 1970s, a period of rapid economic, social, and political change in Brazil.									0	0	0	1	1	1092-6690		WOS:000319890600004		
J	Zhang, Yongjin								The eagle eyes the dragon in space-A critique								SPACE POLICY				29	2	SI		113	120		10.1016/j.spacepol.2013.03.002			MAY 2013	2013	China's space policy and its purpose have become an increasingly contentious subject. This paper critically examines the claims, made by Ashley Tellis, among others, that China has a space strategy decided and coordinated by the Chinese military and dedicated to defeating superior US power locally in an asymmetrical war, and that it is this military space strategy that drives China's single-minded pursuit of space science and technology and the development of China's space programme. To do so, the paper conducts two investigations: into the declining role of the Chinese military in China's foreign and security policy making and its limited influence in formulating China's grand strategy; and the other into the contingent history of China's two space programs, Shenzhou and Chang'e, which have largely been driven by civilian scientist communities, rather than the military. In so doing, I argue that the claims of China's 'military space strategy' are over-imaginative and serve a particular political purpose. The social imaginary of a threatening China produced by the US strategic gaze at China in space, I further argue, has dangerous policy implications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Calvert, Dave								'Royal Pierrots' and 'White Coons': the British Pierrot Troupe in the Racial and National Imaginary								NEW THEATRE QUARTERLY				29	2			107	120		10.1017/S0266464X13000225			MAY 2013	2013	The Pierrot tradition, invented towards the end of the nineteenth century, established a prevalent but now largely forgotten mode of performance around the coastal resorts of Britain. In this article, Dave Calvert considers the relevance of this form in its historical context. Arguing that it observes the preservation of anachronism consistent with notions of invented traditions, he situates the Pierrot tradition within a symbolic network concerned with national identity and experience. This includes its declared links to the construction of royalty as the head of the imperial family, and both its schism and continuity with the tradition of blackface minstrelsy whose conventions it maintains. Its location at the seaside accentuates this network of relations and elevates it to a transcendental plane of the imaginary untroubled by the complexities of modern life. Dave Calvert is a Senior Lecturer in Drama at the University of Huddersfield. His research encompasses popular theatre, applied theatre and learning-disabled performance. He is also a member of The Pierrotters, the last remaining professional seaside Pierrot troupe.									1	0	0	0	1	0266-464X		WOS:000323011700001

J	Moreno Luzon, Javier								Alfonso el Regenerador. Performing Monarchy and Spanish Nationalist Imaginary, from a comparative perspective (1902-1913)								HISPANIA-REVISTA ESPANOLA DE HISTORIA				73	244			319	348		10.3989/hispania.2013.009			MAY-AUG 2013	2013	This article studies the links between monarchy and Spanish nationalism in the first decade of Alfonso XIII's reign. It uses a comparative perspective to analyse the Spanish case in the context of the performing monarchies than emerged in Europe in the period 1870-1914. It focuses on three different aspects: the great monarchical ceremonies, specially the royal oath to the Constitution-or coronation-; the royal trips, extraordinarily developed; and the military ceremonies containing a strong nationalist meaning as the annual swearing of loyalty to the national flag by new soldiers. Through those performances, the crown was integrated in a national imaginary dominated by discourses and practices of regeneration of the fatherland in the aftermath of the colonial disaster of 1898: in such a regeneration, the king was thought as a necessary force. In fact, Alfonso was known as el Regenerador (the regenerator). At a lower level of pomp and splendor than other european monarchies, the Spanish king was perceived as a national symbol by different groups. Among them, local elites, various associations and the heterogeneus public of the royal spectacles, shown by the mass media. Those performances reinforced the political role of a king that enjoyed constitutional executive powers, like most of the European monarchs, and whose decisions were highly controversial.									0	0	0	0	0	0018-2141		WOS:000326612100002

Taking the works of Benedict Anderson on the role of the press in building the imaginaries of national communities, and of George L. Mosse on the nationalization of the masses through monuments as a starting point, this paper analyzes the way in which this representations constructed a cultural idea of the nation for the middle classes to whom the illustrated press was addresed.									0	0	0	0	0	0018-2141		WOS:000326612100004		
J	Garcia Sebastiani, Marcela								Spain out of Spain. Spanish Patriotism in the Argentinian emigration: an approach								HISPANIA-REVISTA ESPANOLA DE HISTORIA				73	244			469	499		10.3989/hispania.2013.014			MAY-AUG 2013	2013	During the first third of the 20th century, Spanish migrants in Argentina prompted, from specific areas of civil society and the public sphere, corporate identity for political purposes. It was a residual patriotism and condemned from the outset. It was activated in specific circumstances and in relation to the local policies projected towards the collective migratory, the Spanish politics, and recognition of shared sociopolitical and cultural genealogies. From the perspective of cultural history of the policy, and based on primary and secondary sources, this article discusses about built imaginaries, social mobilization generated and results between 1885 and 1920. During that time, from distance, migrants also built ideas about Spain and drawn up national myths in the cultural version of liberalism that eventually led to a conservative nationalist, catholic and at times fascist.									0	0	0	0	0	0018-2141		WOS:000326612100007

The fact that many people involved with Nazism had escaped the Nuremberg tribunal and sought refuge in Latin American countries occasioned the appearance of fanciful and fantastic stories about their alleged covert activities aimed at reorganizing the Nazi Party on the continent. One such story referred to the Brazilian towns of Marechal Candido Rondon and Rio do Sul. According to an accusation made by "agent" Erich Erdstein, these towns sheltered Nazi war criminals Josef Mengele and Martin Bormann and the Fourth Reich would be created in them. These accusations can be found in literary works and reports of newspapers and magazines, which, although different in genre, emphasize secret meetings, hidden Nazi bases in the jungle, persecutions and adventures a la Sherlock Holmes and James Bond, the survival of Hitler, the creation of the Fourth Reich on this continent and others. Thus, the article analyzes the discourses about these towns, understanding them as part of an imaginary formed after the war according to which the Fourth Reich could arise anywhere in the world, especially in Latin America.									0	0	0	0	0	1519-3861		WOS:000326957500006		
J	Roberts, Celia								Early puberty, 'sexualization' and feminism								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES				20	2			138	154		10.1177/1350506812456458			MAY 2013	2013	Early onset puberty is increasingly prevalent among girls globally according to many scientists and clinicians. In the medical and scientific literature early sexual development is described as a problem for girls and as a frightening prospect for parents. News media and popular environmentalist accounts amplify these figurations, raising powerful concerns about the sexual predation of early developing girls by men and boys and the loss of childhood innocence. In this article the author frames one feminist approach to early puberty, arguing that feminist theorists should both take scientific work around population changes in sexual development seriously and use their critical skills to unpick and challenge the discourses constituting early development as a matter of concern. The author suggests that contemporary academic and policy debates on the 'sexualization' of girls have important resonance for critical explorations of early puberty. These debates currently pay little attention to the physiological aspects of sexual development and could be enriched by so doing. As in the case of 'sexualization', issues of class, racialization and agency are central to understanding and challenging normative concerns about girls' early sexual development.									1	0	0	0	1	1350-5068		WOS:000330315800003		
J	Breit, Rhonda; Obijiofor, Levi; Fitzgerald, Richard								Internationalization as De-Westernization of the Curriculum: The Case of Journalism at an Australian University								JOURNAL OF STUDIES IN INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION				17	2	SI		119	135		10.1177/1028315312474897			MAY 2013	2013	Internationalization of the curriculum points to the interdependent and interconnected (globalized) world in which higher education operates. However, while international awareness is crucial to the study of journalism, in practice this often means an Anglo-American curriculum based around Western principles of journalism education and training that are deeply rooted in Western values and traditions. This tendency to privilege Western thought, practice, and values obscures from view other journalism practices and renders Western models of journalism desirable, replicable, and transplantable to any part of the world. This article discusses the engagement of a small group of staff in the process of thinking through the meaning of internationalization of the curriculum in their particular disciplinary and institutional context. The staff are located in a school of journalism and communication at a large research intensive university in Australia. The article describes the thinking behind their decision to focus internationalization of the curriculum on "critical de-Westernization" and social imaginaries. This was a gestalt shift resulting from discussion of the way in which "taken for granted" disciplinary canons had hitherto been uncritically embedded into the curriculum. It is argued that treating internationalization of the journalism curriculum as critical de-Westernization has conceptual and practical benefits in a globalized world.									1	0	0	0	1	1028-3153		WOS:000330308900003		
J	Fraser, Alistair								Ethnography at the periphery: Redrawing the borders of criminology's world-map								THEORETICAL CRIMINOLOGY				17	2	SI		251	260		10.1177/1362480612472786			MAY 2013	2013	In the current era of globalization, a paradox has developed in the field of criminology. In the context of the increasingly global nature of crime, there has been a firm recognition among criminologists of the need for comparative, transnational research; particularly that which moves beyond knowledge created in the global North. However, production of this knowledge remains clustered in a relatively narrow range of geographical sites- and understandings of crime and criminology in the South too often defined through the lens of the North. As processes of globalization confound and disrupt the traditional dualisms of East/West and North/South, there is a pressing need for an expansion of criminology's world-map. This article explores the conceptual possibilities of one particular methodology-ethnography-as a means of explicating the deep-seated tensions, fragmented realities and hybridized identities that emerge from the margins of globalization. Drawing on cogent debates from the fields of sociology and anthropology, I argue that ethnographically informed 'theory from the South' can at once enrich the criminological imagination and provoke a more cosmopolitan global imaginary.									3	0	0	0	3	1362-4806		WOS:000330306100007		
J	Zusman, Perla								The Historical geography, imagination and the imaginary geographical								REVISTA DE GEOGRAFIA NORTE GRANDE					54			51	66					MAY 2013	2013	Notions of geographical imagination and imagination are widely used in Geography today. The purpose of this paper is to identify the assumptions of these notions within some Anglo-Saxon geographers; specifically we are interested in studying the role of these ideas in their own discipline project and how these ideas were articulated in their analysis of past geographies. Firstly this paper discusses the concepts of imagination and geographical imagination used during the 1960s and 1970s with the aim of overcoming little Geography awareness with social and cultural aspects. Secondly we present perspectives around these ideas developed in the 1990s by postcolonial geographies and visual culture studies. Finally, we recognize their impact on some lines of research that are being developed in South America in the last decades.									2	0	0	0	2	0718-3402		WOS:000332749000004

J	Pavone, Vincenzo								Ciencia, neoliberalismo y bioeconomía	Science, neoliberalism and the bioeconomy							Revista iberoamericana de ciencia tecnología y sociedad				7	20			145	161					2013-06	2013	The bioeconomy is a project as well as a vision that stems from the neoliberal narrative of economic gro al manipulation, exploitation and appropriation of the living matter. This articles aims at drawing a map of the imaginaries and objectives of the bioeconomy through an analysis of the discourses elaborated by the EU and the OECD. More specifically, it explores the relation between the bioeconomy as a narrative, with its public policy strategies and the neoliberal philosophy that underpins the latter. The bioeconomy emerges, thus, as a step further compared to the knowledge economy, in the neoliberal process oriented towards the extension of market-based ethics and practices to social and biological domains previously regulated in a different way. Turning to the cases of assisted reproduction and biopharming, this paper also shows the role of biotechnologies in the emergences, institutionalization and regulation of the bioeconomy. In its conclusion, it addresses some of the most challenging implications of a transition towards a bioeconomy, such as the process of de-politicization and restriction of access to natural resources that bioeconomies need to take off and consolidate.	La bioeconomía es un proyecto y al mismo tiempo una visión situada dentro de la narrativa neoliberal del crecimiento económico y de la competitividad y habla de una nueva economía basada en la manipulación, explotación y apropiación tecnológica de la materia viviente. Este artículo intenta dibujar un mapa del imaginario y de los objetivos de la bioeconomía a través del análisis de los discursos elaborados (y que circulan) por la UE y la OCDE. Más específicamente, explora la relación entre la bioeconomía como narrativa, con sus estrategias de políticas públicas, y el sistema filosófico neoliberal que la inspira. La bioeconomía aparece como un paso más allá de la misma economía del conocimiento en el proceso neoliberal dispuesto a extender ética y practica del mercado a espacios sociales y biológicos antes regulados por otros principios. Mirando a la reproducción asistida y al bio-pharming, intenta sacar a la luz el papel de las biotecnologías en la constitución, institucionalización y regulación de la bioeconomía. En la conclusión, se vislumbran algunas de las implicaciones políticas y sociales de la transición a un sistema económico basado en la bioeconomía, sobre todo con relación al proceso de de-politicización y de restricción de acceso a la naturaleza que las bioeconomías necesitan para consolidarse.								0	0	0	0	0	1850-0013		SCIELO:S1850-00132013000100009		
J	Amilhat-Szary, Anne-Laure								Towards experimental mountaineering? Perspective on two tours of Alpine borders Lionel Daudet/John Harlin, 2011-2012								REVUE DE GEOGRAPHIE ALPINE-JOURNAL OF ALPINE RESEARCH				101	1			303	318					JUN 2013	2013	In 2011 and 2012, two mountain climbers, John Harlin and Lionel Daudet, undertook individual journeys to follow the entire political border of an alpine country, respectively Switzerland and France, each unaware of the approximate concomitance of their projects. Harlin and Daudet decided to use the imaginary line drawn on a map by political administrations as the pretext and backdrop for a totally new adventure. Their aim was to follow a border along its entire linear route, the abstract nature of which is generally only experienced when one crosses it from one country to another. The self-imposed constraints thus provided them with the basis for a new type of mountaineering, one which involved not only confronting the complex mountainous terrain followed by the borders in Switzerland and France but also practicing a variety of outdoor sporting activities: we suggest referring to this challenge as 'experimental mountaineering'. These projects undoubtedly mark an important change in the practice of mountain sports, where the mountain tour, or circular route, is in the process of earning its place alongside the more traditional summit climbs and mountain crossings. In putting their bodies to the test in following the border, these two men have shown how the idea of the "mobile" border is able to express itself in the form of a constantly renegotiated juxtaposition of spatial characteristics generated by the presence of a limit. The exploits of Harlin and Daudet encourage us not only to go further in our analyses of the affective and physical processes of the body that contribute to the complexity of our relationship with space, but also to refrain from making the body the last "natural border".									0	0	0	0	0	0035-1121		WOS:000343794100012		
J	Katz, Mikhail G.; Sherry, David								Leibniz's Infinitesimals: Their Fictionality, Their Modern Implementations, and Their Foes from Berkeley to Russell and Beyond								ERKENNTNIS				78	3			571	625		10.1007/s10670-012-9370-y			JUN 2013	2013	Many historians of the calculus deny significant continuity between infinitesimal calculus of the seventeenth century and twentieth century developments such as Robinson's theory. Robinson's hyperreals, while providing a consistent theory of infinitesimals, require the resources of modern logic; thus many commentators are comfortable denying a historical continuity. A notable exception is Robinson himself, whose identification with the Leibnizian tradition inspired Lakatos, Laugwitz, and others to consider the history of the infinitesimal in a more favorable light. Inspite of his Leibnizian sympathies, Robinson regards Berkeley's criticisms of the infinitesimal calculus as aptly demonstrating the inconsistency of reasoning with historical infinitesimal magnitudes. We argue that Robinson, among others, overestimates the force of Berkeley's criticisms, by underestimating the mathematical and philosophical resources available to Leibniz. Leibniz's infinitesimals are fictions, not logical fictions, as Ishiguro proposed, but rather pure fictions, like imaginaries, which are not eliminable by some syncategorematic paraphrase. We argue that Leibniz's defense of infinitesimals is more firmly grounded than Berkeley's criticism thereof. We show, moreover, that Leibniz's system for differential calculus was free of logical fallacies. Our argument strengthens the conception of modern infinitesimals as a development of Leibniz's strategy of relating inassignable to assignable quantities by means of his transcendental law of homogeneity.Axiom. No reasoning about things whereof we have no idea. Therefore no reasoning about Infinitesimals.G. Berkeley, Philosophical commentaries (no. 354).									6	0	1	0	7	0165-0106		WOS:000318410100005		
J	Vandemast-Bell, Paul								Rethinking Live Electronic Music: A DJ Perspective								CONTEMPORARY MUSIC REVIEW				32	2-3	SI		239	248		10.1080/07494467.2013.775817			JUN 1 2013	2013	The author critiques the conventional understanding of live electronic music through empirical research on his own DJ practice and investigates others working in the field. In reviewing the opinions of theorists and practitioners in both the live electronic music genre and DJ-ing he argues against the body/machine dialectic that has determined much of the thinking in the former. The author forms a notion of the DJ as a real-time composer working beyond traditional binary distinctions who brings the human body and machine into a mutual relationship. Through practice-led research he charts an investigation beginning in physical human gesture and culminating in digital machine repetition. He concludes that mechanical and digital repetition do not obscure human agency in the production of live works and that this concern is imaginary.

J	Dubow, Jessica; Steadman-Jones, Richard D.								Linguistic cosmopolitans: Arendt, Capek, Orwell								JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES				43	2			119	140		10.1177/0047244113480597			JUN 2013	2013	Political resistance to Fascism in 1930s Europe was often animated by a particular cosmopolitan imaginary. In this article we explore a number of questions concealed within this dynamic. What is the status of language in a space that expands beyond the constraints of the territorial to encompass more mobile allegiances and differently scaled solidarities? Conversely, how does an impulse towards the cosmopolitan turn back to the nation and reframe internal dialogues surrounding the nature of its linguistic constitution? Hannah Arendt's monograph on the nineteenth-century German-Jewish salonniere Rahel Varnhagen, the Czech novelist Karel Capek's satire on twentieth-century totalitarianism, War with the Newts, and George Orwell's accounts of both the Spanish Civil War and the culture of the English working class, all three written in the mid 1930s, engage with language as it detaches itself from the narrow optics of nationalism and reattaches itself to both a politics of the public and an ethics of friendship beyond the nation-state. That 1936 is the date around which these ideas of language and communication cohere gives them a singular resonance. For these three very different writers, ideas of the cosmopolitan provide not only a potential future for human solidarity, but a means of revisiting the nation itself, at once engaging with its history of linguistic repression and with the danger posed by the sovereign monolingualism of Fascism.									0	0	0	0	0	0047-2441		WOS:000319226000002		
J	Nikolaidis, George								Indeterminacy of definitions and criteria in mental health: case study of emotional disorders								JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE				19	3	SI		531	536		10.1111/jep.12053			JUN 2013	2013	Rationale, aims and objectives The concept of emotions has gone through radical transformations during the last couple of centuries. Despite these severe re-specifications of its content, the concept of emotions (and especially some such as depression or anxiety) has acquired a central role in contemporary clinical Psychology and Psychiatry. This creates an apparent paradox, utilizing more and more concepts for which no clear conceptual understanding has been obtained. This paradox creates a challenge for researchers as well as clinicians, as on a daily basis, millions of people are currently ascribed with having' or being in' emotional states, which also entails certain interventions to be applied, without much clear insight into what exactly those states might really constitute. Method Conceptual research in aetiological and historical transformation of theoretical accounts of emotions as well as an overview of relevant empirical research on fundamental emotions. Examining of critical respective questions such as: whether there are any universal typical' emotional reactions to be found in each and every known culture, indicating their intrinsic existence as being a part of the human condition; whether there are basic' and secondary' emotions; whether emotions are merely bodily events, patterns of behavioural reactions to given types of stimuli or whether they rely inevitably on their cognitive content; whether emotions are necessarily intentional (in Brentano's sense) viz. are inevitably about a real or an imaginary object or whether there can be objectless emotional states; whether emotions are in a significant sense rational or fundamentally irrational responses and so forth. Moreover, more recent experimental data advocating for one or the other response to the aforementioned fundamental questions are scrutinized. Results In both conceptual research (including the works of thinkers such as the highly influential contributions of Darwin, James, Cannon, Freud, Ryle and Sartre or contemporary attempts such as the ones of theorists like Solomon, Nash, Rey, Pugmire and Lyons) as well as in comprehensive theoretical schemes combining experimental data (such as the ones provided by the works of Schachter and Singer, Ekman and Friesen, Panksepp, Damasio and Griffiths), there seems to be a radical indeterminacy of conceptual content and fundamental features of emotions in general, as well as of particular emotional states. Furthermore, there is an apparent conceptual incapability to include each and every feature of emotional states within a single comprehensive definition without making reference to contingent particularities of their biological instantiation. Conclusions At least in the crucial concept of emotional states, when examined carefully, it seems that (1) there are substantial barriers to the ambitious quest for a scientific grounding of taxonomies and definitions of phenomena like emotions, due to the inability to provide an independent verification of scientific propositions; (2) all major approaches in Psychology and Psychiatry seem to have serious shortcomings in defining emotions; (3) such shortcomings have to do with fundamental issues such as the nature of mental states; (4) most ordinary concepts of emotions utilized by clinicians and researchers tend to be circular and question begging when scrutinized theoretically; and (5) historically dominant beliefs, values and cultural systems tend to influence heavily both the acceptability of such representations of emotions as well as their very nature.									1	0	0	0	1	1356-1294		WOS:000319298500021	23692241	
J	Hewer, Paul; Brownlie, Douglas; Kerrigan, Finola								'The exploding plastic inevitable': 'Branding being', brand Warhol & the factory years								SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT				29	2			184	193		10.1016/j.scaman.2013.03.004			JUN 2013	2013	This paper contributes to theories of brands as sites of identity work and convergence. It takes as its subject relations of belonging and participation as they shape communal 'scenes' out of which spring intimations of spaces of cultural production as branding ecosystems. To illustrate ways in which this line of thought ignites discourses on branding as a mode of relational being, we explore the social environment fomented around Warhol's court, 'The Factory', that iconic symbol of the mediated logic of his oeuvre. Drawing on archival accounts of Factory life, we explore cultural production as illustrative of brands and branding as social technologies exciting the imaginary and its theater of possibility. And to understand how collective consumption of relations of connectivity nurture conditions suggestive of new branding forms, we consider the existential logic of 'branding being', of thinking 'spaces' made available through branding as a mode of relational being.

J	McDuie-Ra, Duncan								Beyond the 'Exclusionary City': North-east Migrants in Neo-liberal Delhi								URBAN STUDIES				50	8			1625	1640		10.1177/0042098012465126			JUN 2013	2013	Scholars have noted the ways in which Delhi's transformation into a global city has enclosed urban spaces excluding the urban poor, labourers and migrants. One of the neglected aspects of this focus is the way in which Delhi's transformation has created new opportunities for migrants from north-east India. This article is an ethnographic account of migrants from the north-east in Delhi. It is argued that employment opportunities in the neo-liberal spaces of the global city are fuelling a rapid increase in migration from the north-east, the very limit of India's geographical and cultural imaginary. Outside these spaces of economic inclusion, north-east migrants continue to live as exceptional citizens and experience racism, discrimination and violence. The experiences of north-east migrants in Delhi suggest that the exclusionary city narrative is an incomplete view of urban change in India, and reveal how neo-liberal transformation is connecting heartland cities to frontier regions in ways previously unimagined.									0	0	0	0	0	0042-0980		WOS:000319131000010		
J	Spencer, Stephanie								Boarding School Fictions: schoolgirls' own communities of learning								WOMENS HISTORY REVIEW				22	3			386	402		10.1080/09612025.2012.728397			JUN 1 2013	2013	This article explores the fictional world of the schoolgirl annual in the interwar period and the significance of the imagined girls'-only spaces for their intended readership. The article takes the year 1929, the year of Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own, and focuses on two annuals designed for the 1215 market: School Friend and Schoolgirls' Own. The annual compendium of stories, a very British invention, drew on characters whose adventures were followed in the weekly schoolgirl comics and was published at Christmas, a time when there was little personal space available as families gathered together. The imaginary world of boarding schools such as Cliff House or Morcove offered readers an escape from the hierarchy of family life and expectations of girls' participation in the home. Using the background of Woolf's feminist polemic and a framework informed by the theoretical framing of space by feminist geographer Linda McDowell, the article teases out the meaning of the multilayered nature of stories created by men with no experience of single-sex girls' school, writing as women.									0	0	0	0	0	0961-2025		WOS:000319378600003

J	Barras, Amelie; Guillaume, Xavier								The safety of authenticity: Ali Kebab, or an exploration in the contemporaneity of foreignness and the self's post-colonial imaginary								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES				16	3			310	328		10.1177/1367549413476010			JUN 2013	2013	The article explores how the concept of authenticity is deployed in contemporary Switzerland to delimit not only the representational boundaries of the Muslim (foreign) 'other', but also of the dominant cultural self. The authors analyse the act of constituting the authentic other in relation to the stability, comfort and safeness of the dialogically constituted authentic self, as illustrated in a Swiss advertising campaign in summer 2009. To investigate how those power relations unfold in the Ali Kebab advertising campaign, the article draws on a framework of visual analysis that studies the field of significations carried by specific images in relation to the particular context in which they are deployed, then facilitates their recontextualisation within wider social discourses. This sheds light on how the categories of authenticity displayed by the Ali Kebab adverts draw on a deep and powerful colonial imaginary that goes well beyond the borders of Switzerland.									0	0	0	0	0	1367-5494		WOS:000319472300003		
J	Baucal, Aleksandar; Zittoun, Tania								Religion as Dialogical Resource: A Socio-cultural Approach								INTEGRATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE				47	2			207	219		10.1007/s12124-013-9229-z			JUN 2013	2013	William James proposed a psychological study of religion examining people's religious experiences, and to see in what sense these were good for them. The recent developments of psychology of religion moved far from that initial proposition. In this paper, we propose a sociocultural perspective to religion that renews with that initial stance. After recalling Vygtotsky's core ideas, we suggest that religion, as cultural and symbolic system, participates to the orchestration of human activities and sense-making. Such orchestration works both from within the person, through internalized values and ideas, and from without, through the person's interactions with others, discourses, cultural objects etc. This leads us to consider religions as supporting various forms of dialogical dynamics-intra-psychological dialogues, interpersonal with present, absent or imaginary others, as well as inter-group dialogues-which we illustrate with empirical vignettes. The example of religious tensions in the Balkans in the 90's highlights how much the historical-cultural embeddedness of these dynamics can also lead to the end of dialogicality, and therefore, sense-making.									3	0	0	0	3	1932-4502		WOS:000319068800002	23355096

Multiple financial modernities. International financial centres, urban boosters and the Internet as the site of negotiations, Regional Studies. The 1990s and 2000s (the noughties') saw a large number of urban boosters trying to frame specific international financial centres (IFCs) as hotspots for global financial activities. This paper investigates the images projected through dedicated websites of different IFCs to trace the self-representations and self-understandings of IFCs and their boosters. It investigates, first, the extent to which urban boosters are deliberately pursuing financial strategies through the Internet; and, second, how their negotiations of the global and the local, space and place, the universal and the particular, modernity and tradition result in multiple modernities' as projected through the imaginaries on IFC websites.									1	0	0	0	1	0034-3404		WOS:000319552700003

But exactly what factors determine the contents of prospection? Extending research on action identification and temporal construal, here we explored how action goals and temporal distance modulate the characteristics of future previews. Participants were required to imagine travelling to Egypt (in the near or distant future) to climb or photograph a pyramid. Afterwards, to probe the contents of prospection, participants provided a sketch of their imaginary experience. Results elucidated the impact of goal type and temporal distance on mental imagery. While a climbing goal prompted participants to draw a larger pyramid in the near than distant future, a photographic goal influenced only the compositional complexity of the sketches. These findings reveal how action goals and temporal distance shape the contents of future simulations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

J	Bredeloup, Sylvie								The figure of the adventurer as an African migrant								JOURNAL OF AFRICAN CULTURAL STUDIES				25	2			170	182		10.1080/13696815.2012.751870			JUN 1 2013	2013	African migration is not determined just through misery and danger. Personal ambition is an important catalyst compelling the more intrepid to hit the road. The decision to leave can result in a pressing urge to change lifestyle, to invent new ways of life, to explore far-off lands, real or imaginary. The migratory adventure is not only synonymous with a departure abroad - close or distant; it is also similar to a moral experience which is tightly correlated with risk or intensity of life. After introducing the different promoters of the African migratory adventure, the article will show that more and more African women, in the process of their migration, claim the status of the adventurer for themselves. Then, the times of adventure will enlighten, the beginning, the time of youth, and the end when the migrants come back home. Several outcomes to the migratory adventure are also possible. Upwards, for those who are able to convert their mobility capital and connect themselves to transnational networks. Downwards, for exhausted and socially unaffiliated individuals who can neither continue to move on nor turn back, because they are estranged by their countrymen.									0	0	0	0	0	1369-6815		WOS:000319552300006

Feminist scholarship: (1) contributes to the ongoing project of rethinking how economic geography is conceived and practised; (2) provides some analytical resources to inform the production of more complex, less partial geographies of financialization; (3) is defined by its strong political and ethical commitments and can contribute to an economic geography better able to understand and form critical responses to the recent crisis.									1	0	0	0	1	0309-1325		WOS:000319700500005

Literature is viewed here as a territory "in the making" which allows for the emergence of significant relations depending on the nature of reception. From the perspective of transnational and transoceanic exchanges, in the context of present-day globalization with its massive migrations, numerous exiles and other forms of passage, we would like to make a contribution to the reflections on the critical posture of the relational by taking into account these various modes of crossing, translation and multiple relations, both in the social and in the artistic fields.	Distinguimos en este trabajo entre la puesta en escena de lo nacional según una dirección y estrategias ideológicas que caracterizan una literatura que acompaña la creación de los estados nacionales, y la modalidad de los desplazamientos reales o imaginarios que asume el artista en su obra, que produce una traducción o modalidad de lo intertextual y extraterritorialidades diversas, y que recupera el lector como búsqueda de huellas y correspondencias entre una o más obras. La literatura como territorio en devenir, que da lugar a relaciones significativas emergentes, según el tipo de recepción. Teniendo en cuenta esta perspectiva, la de los intercambios transnacionales y transoceánicos en el contexto de la globalización actual, bajo la influencia de migraciones masivas, de constantes exilios y otros tipos de pasajes, queremos contribuir a la reflexión sobre una postura crítica de lo relacional que admita estas modalidades de trasvases, traducciones y relaciones múltiples en lo social como en el campo de la creación.

Les modalités de l'intertextuel y sont à l'œuvre, aussi bien que les jeux d'extraterritorialité ; ils sont perçus par le lecteur dans sa recherche de traces et correspondances entre une ou plusieurs œuvres. Selon cette perspective, en particulier dans le contexte des échanges transnationaux et transocéaniques de la globalisation actuelle, sous l'influence des migrations massives, des exils et d'autres types de passages, nous souhaitons contribuer à la réflexion portant sur une posture critique du relationnel qui admet ces modalités de transmissions, traductions et relations multiples tant au niveau social que dans le champ de la création.						0	0	0	0	0	1517-106X		SCIELO:S1517-106X2013000100008

We examine how the professional world is inserted in the teaching practice and in the classroom dynamics, intermingled with the pedagogical discourse. In view of that, the objective of this study was to investigate how the image that the teacher attributes to himself/herself and to the students produces meaning effects in the didactic-pedagogical procedures in disciplines of the area of publicity creation. In order to do that, we conducted an empirical research in which we selected discourse sequences produced in 2010 through audio and video recording of classes in the disciplines of Creation, Art Direction, Publicity Writing and Campaign Creation at the Escola Superior de Propaganda e Marketing (Higher School of Publicity and Marketing) of Porto Alegre. We found out that the program worked in the classroom, and which emerges during the preparation of the course, is determined by the imaginary formulations of the teacher, by the anticipation of the meaning effect, and by the homogenization of students. The educative action is guided by the anticipation of the resistance of the teaching system. Lastly, we discovered that the places of teacher and of student are socially incorporated representations that impact decisively upon pedagogical practices.		A partir das noções de formações imaginárias e antecipação, este artigo apresenta uma reflexão sobre o ensino de criação publicitária na perspectiva teórica da análise de discurso. Examinamos como o mundo profissional insere-se na prática docente e na dinâmica da sala de aula, entrelaçando-se ao discurso pedagógico. Diante disso, o objetivo do estudo foi investigar o modo como a imagem que o professor atribui a si e aos estudantes produz efeitos de sentido nos procedimentos didático-pedagógicos em disciplinas da área de criação publicitária. Para cumprir tal objetivo, recorremos a uma pesquisa de caráter empírico, na qual selecionamos sequências discursivas produzidas em 2011 por meio da gravação em áudio e vídeo de aulas das disciplinas de Criação, Direção de Arte, Redação Publicitária e Criação de Campanha na Escola Superior de Propaganda e Marketing de Porto Alegre. Revelamos que o conteúdo programático trabalhado em sala de aula e que emerge durante a preparação do curso é determinado pelas formulações imaginárias do professor, pela antecipação do efeito de sentido e pela homogeneização dos estudantes. A ação educativa é norteada pela antecipação da resistência do sistema de ensino. Por fim, pode-se afirmar que o lugar de professor e de aluno são representações socialmente incorporadas que impactam terminantemente as práticas pedagógicas.							0	0	0	0	0	1517-9702		SCIELO:S1517-97022013000200012

I argue that political action at the intersections between environmental degradation and environmental change produce anticipatory histories' (DeSilvey, 2012) of planetary crisis. Anticipatory histories' disorder linear and depoliticised understandings of external crisis and they support different social imaginaries of the relationship between everyday life and geophysical events. Drawing its inspiration from recent environmental justice projects in the United States (New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and high-level nuclear waste disposal at Yucca Mountain in Nevada), this article explores what environmental justice can teach us about living with environmental crisis and change.									0	0	0	0	0	1474-7731		WOS:000321286000008

In particular it focuses on the city of Pelotas in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul and the significant societal and material transformations that are causing conflict and dissonance in relation to the future role of cycling on city streets. Using a combination of empirical evidence from existing literature; a focus group with members of the cycling stakeholder forum; interviews with planning officials whilst observing cycle infrastructure; interviews with participants whilst taking part in a 'protest' bicycle ride (bicicletada); and on street intercept interviews with cycle commuters, this paper highlights the tensions, conflicts, aspirations and imaginaries of a city grappling with significant growth and urban transformation.

Traditionally, scholars have focused on the physical proximity of other people, assuming copresence to be a given, objective condition. However, recent empirical evidence on technologically mediated (e.g., e-mail), imaginary (e.g., prayer), and parasocial (e.g., watching a television show) interactions challenges classic copresence assumptions. In this article we reconceptualize copresence to provide theoretical building blocks (definitions, assumptions, and propositions) for a revitalized research program that allows for the explicit assessment of copresence as an endogenous, subjective variable dynamically related to social context. We treat copresence as the degree to which an actor perceives mutual entrainment (i.e., synchronization of attention, emotion, and behavior) with another actor. We demonstrate the ramifications of this reconceptualization for classic theorizing on micro-macro linkages and contemporary research questions, including methodological artifacts in laboratory research and disparities in patient-provider rapport.									1	0	0	0	1	0735-2751		WOS:000322008500004

JUN 2013	2013	Through an examination of spiritual warfare handbooks, this article hopes to make material both Third Wave Evangelical imaginings of physical space and their rituals to purify it, activities that might be described as attempts to fix the interstitial into position, to name it and claim for it a classification and moral assessment. Spiritual warfare manuals teach Evangelical readers how to exorcise ("deliver") people, objects and places from the unwelcome demons who have taken residence in them. Specifically, I focus on two spaces and places that garner a great deal of attention in this literature: "haunted houses" and "defiled land." I argue that these locations, in the Third Wave Evangelical imaginary, may be described as "spatial limbos"-interstitial and contested no-man's lands in which the sins of history materialize in the form of demons. Such sites are spiritual battlefields that, far from being empty, are over-determined with ambivalent meaning and significance.									0	0	0	0	0	1743-2200		WOS:000322286500002

All these hypostases lead to a common element: the real woman, the woman who feels and lives according to her human nature, versus the imaginary woman belonging to chivalrous literature. The many feminine characters populating Cervantes's work-Camilla, Marcela, Luscinda, Dorothea-are, unlike their literary predecessors, the Ladies of the Middle Ages, prominent expressions of free will. Even though sociologically speaking the women's status during the Renaissance does not register mutations as compared to the previous era, the marked difference promoted by literature lies in their struggle to achieve fulfillment as human beings within life's boundaries.									0	0	0	0	0	1221-1249		WOS:000322935600001

We start from the mythical construction of the gaucho figure and its uses by Gauchism, which identifies this figure as the ideal pattern to be internalized by multiple learning processes. As a conclusion, we want to highlight some dimensions of the discourse of cultural diversity in contexts such as the cult of Gauchism and of the Traditionalism nowadays. We are based on a bibliographic analysis and fieldwork which demonstrate the educational scenery as a field of disputed permeated by different forms of symbolic violence, which involves ideas, values and imaginaries in the processes of construction of regional identities.

To investigate the textual genre, in the light of the relation between imaginary, time and memory, this analysis uses Cultural Studies, narrative theories and educational concepts. It highlights how an ironic, and yet emotional and poetic tone is used in the movie in order to criticize the educational failures of the former Febem, in contrast with the actions of a French pedagogue who dedicated herself to the boy's recovery, as an emblematic example of social inclusion. To conclude, it discusses the narrative in its pedagogical purpose, emphasizing education and culture as effective pillars of citizenship.

According to the assumption that we narrate to elaborate life experiences, we recognize that narration is a privileged procedure to access the underlying affective-emotional senses of any human conduct. We elaborated a fictional narrative about infant abandonment to be completed by students of Physical Education and Journalism. After psychoanalytical considerations, such imaginative productions suggest an ambiguous perspective. The mother is seen as responsible for the baby's destiny, despite the comprehensibility of her behavior, even if interpreted in terms of its social context. Such posture seems to translate the contrast between an ethical treatment of the maternal conflict and social expectations about maternal figure, usually hidden under the contemporary discourse of the politically correct.

Desarrollamos un relato de ficción sobre el abandono infantil para que los estudiantes de Educación Física y Periodismo lo completasen. Tales producciones imaginativas, considerados psicoanalíticamente, indican un enfoque ambiguo.

The premise is that, because of these factors, the image of the metropolis has been changing in a positive way. Methodologically, we first take the city into consideration like a macrosocial phenomena and after we reflect about its intraurban structural problems that interfere in the imaginary people have about it. Theoretically, we use historical, demographic, economic and social studies whose synthesis give us the support in the construction of interpretations about the metropolitan reality today and provide us the subsidies in the reflections presented here		A Região Metropolitana do Rio de Janeiro vem atravessando conjuntura favorável, inclusive por ter sido a escolhida para sediar grandes eventos globais nos próximos anos.

Grewal considers the concept of the proletarian woman in socialist culture first within the context of a local and global field of contending modernist visions of femininity, class, and the city. Next, Grewal analyses how the figure of the Chinese proletarian woman activates a socialist transnationality through shared formal and narrative innovations of translational leftist literature and cinema. Through her analysis, Grewal suggests how the 1930s Chinese transnational socialist imaginary presents a moment of global modernity based on simultaneity and affinity through political solidarity.									0	0	0	0	0	1481-4374		WOS:000323539800008

Lacanian Ethics and Kojevian Dialectics in Mikhail Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita								LAW & LITERATURE				25	2			206	225		10.1525/lal.2013.25.2.206			SUM 2013	2013	This article explores Lacan's controversial notion of the ethical act through the medium of Mikhail Bulgakov's satirical novel The Master and Margarita. A prominent theme throughout the novel is the guilt and penitence that consumes two of the main characters, Pilate and The Master. On a closer inspection, it seems the dialectic between the characters' desire and the intervention of the law is the cause behind this incurable feeling of guilt. In contrast to the male characters, Margarita remains unwaveringly committed to her own desire, reaping both the rewards and consequences of becoming the ultimate Lacanian ethical subject. The following analysis on each of the three characters will focus on the law-desire dialectic; demonstrate the connotations between the characters and Lacan's Imaginary, Symbolic, and Real; and draw from Kojeve's interpretation of Hegel's Master-Slave dialectic. Mapping the contours of each character's desire and the intervention of the law reveals Lacan's concept of guilt and the tragic dimensions of becoming the ultimate Lacanian hero.									0	0	0	0	0	1535-685X		WOS:000323912300004

Taking up these proposals, we will analyze how black settlers from High Atrato, in the Colombian Pacific, build their imaginaries around the state, through its interaction with the officials in charge of the policy of collective titling to black communities. This analysis will allow us to see how, far from being a monolithic and coherent entity, the State is presented as a complex organization, as an arena of relationships and inequalities of power and influence between different actors, which when adhering to the dominant institutional structures, end up contributing to the overall project of state domination	En las últimas décadas, el campo de los estudios antropológicos ha visto florecer distintas propuestas encaminadas al análisis etnográfico del Estado, las cuales han desplazado su foco de atención desde el aparato de gobierno centralizado hacia los diferentes actores implicados en los procesos de construcción estatal.

Este análisis nos permitirá constatar cómo, lejos de constituirse en una entidad monolítica y coherente, el Estado se presenta como una organización compleja, como una arena de relaciones y desigualdades de poder y de influencia entre diferentes actores que, al adherirse a las estructuras institucionales dominantes, terminan contribuyendo al apuntalamiento del proyecto global de dominación estatal.

After positioning the subject in some coordinates of the current sociological discussion, we present four specific fields from schütz' contributions: the ability to expand and make a creative use of "the social heritage of knowledge", the individual and collective capacity to imagine action projects, the ability to create and use symbols, and producing with them exclusive worlds of imaginary existence, as well as the ability to give birth to new experiences. It is stated that these four fields outline the contours of a phenomenology of creativity of action, which sets out some open fields for further research.	El artículo propone una revisión de la obra de Schütz desde la pregunta por la "creatividad" de la acción social, que no fue formulada expresamente por el autor pero que encuentra en sus escritos un importante principio de respuesta. Después de ubicar el tema en algunas coordenadas de la actual discusión sociológica, se exponen cuatro campos concretos de aportes schützianos: la capacidad de ampliar y hacer uso creativo del "acervo social de conocimiento"; la capacidad individual y colectiva de imaginar proyectos de acción; la capacidad de crear y usar símbolos, y de producir con ellos mundos de exclusiva existencia imaginaria; y la capacidad de dar nacimiento constante a nuevas vivencias. Se afirma que estos cuatro campos dibujan los contornos de una fenomenología de la creatividad de la acción, en vistas de la cual se establecen algunos campos abiertos para nuevas investigaciones.

Depois de colocar o tema em algumas coordenadas da atual discussão sociológica, expõem-se quatro campos concretos de aportes schützianos: a capacidade de amplificar e fazer uso criativo do "acervo social de conhecimento"; capacidade individual e coletiva de imaginar projetos de ação; a capacidade de criar e usar símbolos, e de produzir com eles mundos de exclusiva existência imaginaria; e a capacidade de dar nascimento constante a novas vivências. Afirma-se que estes quatro campos debuxam os contornos de uma fenomenologia da criatividade da ação, tendo em vista que estabelecem alguns campos abertos para novas pesquisas.							0	0	0	0	0	0120-4807		SCIELO:S0120-48072013000100013		
J	Norton, Bryan G.								Leopold, Hadley, and Darwin: Darwinian Epistemology, Truth, and Right								CONTEMPORARY PRAGMATISM				10	1			1	28					JUN 2013	2013	It has been argued, in Environmental Values (Callicott, et al., 2009), that the evidence advanced that Aldo Leopold was influenced by American Pragmatism is "imaginary," and that apparent textual evidence that Leopold learned key ideas from A.T. Hadley, President of Yale University and a self-avowed Pragmatist, can be explained away. It is shown that Callicott, et, al. misunderstand pragmatism, misunderstand what environmental pragmatists have attributed to Leopold, and fail to understand either the context or the internal argument of Leopold's "Conservation as a Moral Issue." Consequently, they miss important contributions that Leopold made to the philosophy of conservation.									0	0	0	0	0	1572-3429		WOS:000326206300001

J	Kulper, Amy								Almost exactly: realism at 7/8 scale								ARQ-ARCHITECTURAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY				17	2			121	129		10.1017/S135913551300047X			JUN 2013	2013	As a discipline, architects pride themselves on the precision and exactitude of their spatial endeavors - no minutiae is too small, no details too inconsequential. However, when exactitude becomes the representational aspiration of architecture, when the images architects produce almost exactly' deliver the reality they hope to soon conjure, a tautology ensues. This article explores the exigencies of the ? scale - a scale that is almost exactly but not quite the same as reality. It is the remaining ? that eschews representational tautology, that produces the effect of exactness, and that populates architecture's historical and spatial imaginaries. Through the lens of one highly symbolic and historically configured room, the Oval Office, this article attempts to map the hazards and pitfalls of realism as a disciplinary aspiration, while simultaneously embracing the figurative realm of the ? and the promise of its imaginative potential.									0	0	0	0	0	1359-1355		WOS:000327736300007		
J	Ozum, Aytul								An Analysis of the Elements of Magical Realism in Onat Kutlar's Ishak and Bilge Karasu's Gocmus Kediler Bahcesi								BILIG					66			179	204					SUM 2013	2013	The term magical realism was employed for the first time in 1925 by Franz Roh to name the change in post-expressionistic art of painting. It was also used for the literary movement that appeared in the first half of the 20th century in Latin America and then for the narrative style in Europe. The most significant feature of magical realism is that the supernatural, fantastic, mythic and fabulative events and characters are accepted as they are in the realistic narrative discourse without any challenge. In this narrative style neither the first nor the second of the binary oppositions such as real/imaginary, human being/beast, ordinary/extraordinary and natural/supernatural is superior to the other. In contemporary Turkish literature it is possible to come across some works having the characteristics of this narrative style. Onat Kutlar's Ishak (1959) and Bilge Karasu's Gocmus Kediler Bahcesi (1979) are written in the style of magical realism. In this study, the aim is to analyse how Ishak and the stories selected from Gocmus Kediler Bahcesi, despite the twenty year gap in between, thematise the writers' common approach towards the concepts of death, life, mystery, passion, search and fear in their style of magical realism.									0	0	0	0	0	1301-0549		WOS:000328851300008

J	Singer, Ben								The human simulation lab-dissecting sex in the simulator lab: the clinical lacuna of transsexed embodiment.								The Journal of medical humanities				34	2			249	54		10.1007/s10912-013-9229-5			2013-Jun	2013	This article begins with an ethnographically documented incident whereby nursing students dissected a medical human simulator model and rearranged it so that the "male" head and torso was attached to the "female" lower half. They then joked about the embodiment of the model, thus staging a scene of anti-trans ridicule. The students' lack of ability, or purposeful refusal, to recognize morphological biodiversity in medical settings indicates a lacuna in clinical imaginaries. Even as trans-identified and gender nonconforming people increasingly access care in the clinic, the lacuna of transsex-as a proxy term for non-binary embodiment-persists at the heart of clinical practice. This article concludes that we might engage in more ethical clinical practice if we recognize and affirm the trace of multiple forms of human being in the non-human simulator.									0	0	0	0	0			MEDLINE:23475454	23475454	
J	Sevilla Buitrago, Alvaro								Planning the commons? Self-management, communal regulation of land and its eclipse in pre-capitalist England								SCRIPTA NOVA-REVISTA ELECTRONICA DE GEOGRAFIA Y CIENCIAS SOCIALES				17	442			1	32					JUN 20 2013	2013	The ongoing eclipse of the Welfare State and the privatisation of public goods and services have triggered the appearance of discourses that claim the recovery of the commons and their collective self-management. In this context historical common lands and rights in pre-capitalist England are no longer a mere academic issue, as they reappear intensely in the sociospatial imaginaries of global activism. This reappropriation of the past seems legitimate, but such narratives often ignore the complexity of the management, planning and evolution of the historical commons. To fill these lacunae I study the institutions and modes of government that underpinned the communal regime in this period, emphasizing its condition of self-managed land use planning. Enclosure acts destroyed this regime, introducing a new logic of centralized, iniquitous planning: a logic which included not only the extinction of communal institutions and privatisation of land, but also the dispossession of rural labourers and their progressive proletarianisation.									0	0	0	0	0	1138-9788		WOS:000321144700001		
J	McCormick, Sheree A.; Causer, Joe; Holmes, Paul S.								Active Vision during Action Execution, Observation and Imagery: Evidence for Shared Motor Representations								PLOS ONE				8	6					e67761	10.1371/journal.pone.0067761			JUN 25 2013	2013	The concept of shared motor representations between action execution and various covert conditions has been demonstrated through a number of psychophysiological modalities over the past two decades. Rarely, however, have researchers considered the congruence of physical, imaginary and observed movement markers in a single paradigm and never in a design where eye movement metrics are the markers. In this study, participants were required to perform a forward reach and point Fitts' Task on a digitizing tablet whilst wearing an eye movement system. Gaze metrics were used to compare behaviour congruence between action execution, action observation, and guided and unguided movement imagery conditions. The data showed that participants attended the same task-related visual cues between conditions but the strategy was different. Specifically, the number of fixations was significantly different between action execution and all covert conditions. In addition, fixation duration was congruent between action execution and action observation only, and both conditions displayed an indirect Fitts' Law effect. We therefore extend the understanding of the common motor representation by demonstrating, for the first time, common spatial eye movement metrics across simulation conditions and some specific temporal congruence for action execution and action observation. Our findings suggest that action observation may be an effective technique in supporting motor processes. The use of video as an adjunct to physical techniques may be beneficial in supporting motor planning in both performance and clinical rehabilitation environments.									3	0	2	0	3	1932-6203		WOS:000321223000117	23825683	
J	Martos Nunez, Eloy; Martos Garcia, Alberto								Ecofictions and Imaginay of Water and its importance for cultural memory and sustainability								ALPHA-REVISTA DE ARTES LETRAS Y FILOSOFIA					36			71	91					JUL 2013	2013	Water culture must be linked in a special way to expressions of intangible cultural heritage of peoples, such as oral or written traditions, symbols or rituals that make up what we call the imaginary water. They must be analyzed and deconstructed in the light of the new paradigms, such as hermeneutics and the ecocriticism. Thus, mythography helps shape the profound meaning of the culture of the water at the new environmental, educational and cultural demands of the 21st century, in a context where the water is not only a strategic resource but a cultural property linked to local development and sustainability policies. Therefore, to know the ancestral traditions and imaginaries in connection to water, and to educate students with the plural values of these cultural manifestations, -which always aimed to respect and knowledge of the natural and cultural heritage-we contribute decisively to the governance of the water and the sustainable and responsible management of water resources then no doubt the main problem of sustainability will be the education of citizens.									0	0	0	0	0	0718-2201		WOS:000337748700006

Understand the meanings of self-care and oral and interpret the perceptions of children, youth and significant adults responsible for their care about it. Materials and methods: Qualitative study with a hermeneutic approach. Involved 34 children and young people and significant adults in a specialized institution Antioquia - Colombia. The data collection was performed by the use of participatory methodologies and playful. The process of data analysis consisted of the condensation of the data from the exercise of open and axial coding. Results: Two categories emerged: the senses of oral self-care concept linked to the implementation of practices to prevent disease and mouth with a connotation related to the affective. The second category, perceptions of care, show the lack of autonomy in children and young people to make self-care practices, and parents, social representations about the inability of children and young people to take their own care. Conclusions: It is necessary to develop leading to the transformation of imaginary disqualifying children and young people with Down syndrome as actors in their care educational processes. Also work for the recognition of diversity, that this population develop skills for independent, dignified and healthy life.	Introducción y objetivo: El cuidado y el autocuidado de la salud bucal de niños y jóvenes con Síndrome de Down están asociados especialmente con los imaginarios sociales de padres, cuidadores y niños, en torno al cuidado de su salud. Comprender los sentidos del autocuidado general y bucal e interpretar las percepciones que tienen los niños, los jóvenes y los adultos significativos responsables de su cuidado sobre el tema. Materiales y métodos: Estudio de corte cualitativo con enfoque hermenéutico. Participaron 34 niños y jóvenes, y los adultos significativos de una Institución especializada en Antioquia-Colombia. La recolección de la información se realizó mediante la utilización de metodologías participativas y lúdicas. El proceso de análisis de la información consistió en la condensación de los datos a partir del ejercicio de codificación abierta y axial. Resultados: Dos categorías emergieron: los sentidos de autocuidado bucal, concepción ligada a la realización de prácticas para evitar la enfermedad y a la boca con una connotación relacionada con lo afectivo. La segunda categoría, las percepciones acerca del cuidado, muestran la carencia de autonomía en niños y jóvenes para realizar prácticas de autocuidado, y en los padres, representación social acerca de la incapacidad de los niños y jóvenes para asumir su propio cuidado. Conclusión: Es necesario desarrollar procesos educativos conducentes a la transformación de imaginarios que inhabilitan a los niños y jóvenes con síndrome de Down como actores de su cuidado. Igualmente, trabajar por el reconocimiento de la diversidad, para que este grupo poblacional desarrolle habilidades para una vida autónoma, digna y saludable.								0	0	0	0	0	0120-971X		SCIELO:S0120-971X2013000200006		
J	Kurganskii, A V								[Quantitative measures of cortical functional connectivity: a state-of-art brief survey].								Fiziologiia cheloveka				39	4			112	22					2013 Jul-Aug	2013	This par reviews modern approaches to measuring cortical functional and effective connectivity in neurocognitive networks--the large-scale distributed systems of interacting neuronal populations which are thought to underlie the cognitive processing. Two broad classes of methods of connectivity estimation, linear and nonlinear, are discussed. In the class of linear methods, besides the coherence that is routinely used for measuring the strength of functional links, the vector autoregressive modeling of multichannel EEG is discussed in some details. The latter technique allows for estimating both functional and effective connectivity with such measures as directed transfer function (DTF) and direct partial coherence (PDC) which are commonly used in cognitive neuroscience. The impact of volume conduction onto the different estimates of connectivity is considered. The imaginary part of the complex-valued coherence as a way to reduce the artificial influence of volume conduction is also discussed. In the class of nonlinear methods, the Independent Component Analysis and the Transfer entropy as a method of estimation of directed influence are reviewed.									0	0	0	0	0	0131-1646		MEDLINE:25486837	25486837	
J	Jimenez Redondo, Juan Carlos								THE IBERIAN CUSTOMS UNION, 1945-1977: A METAPHOR OF AN IMPOSSIBLE UNION								HISTORIA Y POLITICA					30			55	88					JUL-DEC 2013	2013	The idea of a Customs Union has always been part of the symbolic and imaginary universe of Iberianism, as a project for a politically unified Iberian Peninsula. Even if in the nineteenth century, this Iberianism became a dynamic of convergence, however, it did not lead to any concrete results; in the case of Portugal, the project was never more than an elitist and unpopular proposition, linked to the modernization failures and the frequent crises of national identity. The dictatorships of Franco and Salazar were a structural break in the relationship between the two countries that allowed the resurgence of the ideas of an Iberian common market. The replacement of the concept of Iberianism for that of peninsular alliance opened a new possibility in the frame of the Salazar's increasing nationalism. But, in any case, the lack of maturity of the Spanish and Portuguese backward economies and other conjuctural factors broke down that possibility as well.									0	0	0	0	0	1575-0361		WOS:000339532600003

The article analyses the cross-border solidarities that took place during the war, questioning the opposition between the logic of the State and the logic of the local populations (in regards to the border), electing as its empirical and historiographical object, the case of refugee fluxes to the Portuguese village of Barrancos. Methodologically we seek to intertwine documentary sources, oral sources and field work conducted between 2006 and 2010 in Barrancos (Baixo Alentejo), and in the neighboring Spanish villages of Encinasola (Andalusia) and Oliva de la Frontera (Extremadura). The analytical approach to historical memory, borders and power relations, explains the strategies of resistance of social actors, defining them as a cultural praxis conformed throughout the historical process.									0	0	0	0	0	1575-0361		WOS:000339532600005

Its primary attention is on the shifting geographical imaginaries that linked the Malay world with southern India - and on the ways these imaginaries were embedded in the cultural and intellectual lives of Tamil-speaking Muslims. It focuses on the ways in which the Malay world overlapped and interacted with the world of the Bay of Bengal. By combining a range of textual sources with a series of biographical sketches of individuals with multiple roots - people whose lives and writings were shaped by their connections across the Bay of Bengal - this article argues that inter-regional flows of people, ideas, texts, and material culture shaped the modern Malay world.									0	0	0	0	0	1363-9811		WOS:000319551800004

Yet, the specific mechanisms accounting for this link are still undetermined. The present study aimed to address this gap in the literature by testing a theoretical model proposing that adolescents' satisfaction of BPN in life and sense of uniqueness mediate the association of parental support for BPN and happiness. The analyses relied on structural equation modeling and bootstrapping procedures and found support for the model. The theoretical implications of the model for SDT and applied considerations to improve the well-being of adolescents are discussed. Also, suggestions for future research that could further improve our understanding of the dynamic interplay between BPN, sense of uniqueness and happiness are presented.									0	0	0	0	0	0303-8300		WOS:000319754100009		
J	Perugorria, Ignacia; Tejerina, Benjamin								Politics of the encounter: Cognition, emotions, and networks in the Spanish 15M								CURRENT SOCIOLOGY				61	4	SI		424	442		10.1177/0011392113479743			JUL 2013	2013	This article seeks to analyze the mobilizations that are currently taking place in Spain as a result of the multidimensional crisis unleashed in 2008. The authors study the 15M movement,' or that of the Spanish indignados, by focusing on three analytical axes: the cognitive, emotional, and relational processes feeding the construction of a social movement identity. First, the article refers to the diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational framing tasks performed by 15M participants to define the problematic situation and attribute blame, articulate a solution to the problem and devise strategies to achieve that end, and motivate participants to sustain their engagement and remedy the situation. Second, the article concentrates on the emotions that were mobilized' by social movement organizations linked to the 15M (e.g. outrage or indignation), and those emotions that emerged spontaneously during the encounters' that took place in the public space: joy, efficacy, and empowerment. Finally, the article addresses the relational aspects entailed in the process of identity construction, that is, the activation and de-activation of both real' and imaginary' ties between 15M members and previous and/or current political and social collectives within the progressive field.' In following this triple objective, the article describes the process of identity-synchronization that has allowed people with no previous political participation and with different and oftentimes opposing politico-ideological trajectories to feel part of the movement. The data come from 17 in-depth interviews and eight focus groups with key activists, ethnographic observations in camps and assemblies in both Bilbao and Madrid during the summer of 2011, and visual materials displayed in web pages and Facebook accounts associated to the 15M.ResumeCet article a comme objectif d'analyser les mobilisations actuelles en Espagne comme consequence de la crise multidimensionnelle qui commenca en 2008.

J	Robinson, Sarah R.; Nguyen, Cac T.; Allen, Jont B.								Characterizing the ear canal acoustic impedance and reflectance by pole-zero fitting								HEARING RESEARCH				301		SI		168	182		10.1016/j.heares.2013.03.004			JUL 2013	2013	This study characterizes middle ear complex acoustic reflectance (CAR) and impedance by fitting poles and zeros to real-ear measurements. The goal of this work is to establish a quantitative connection between pole-zero locations and the underlying physical properties of CAR data. Most previous studies have analyzed CAR magnitude; while the magnitude accounts for reflected power, it does not encode latency information. Thus, an analysis that studies the real and imaginary parts of the data together, being more general, should be more powerful. Pole-zero fitting of CAR data is examined using data compiled from various studies, dating back to Voss and Allen (1994). Recent CAR measurements were taken using the Mimosa Acoustics HearID system, which makes complex acoustic impedance and reflectance measurements in the ear canal over a 0.2-6.0 [kHz] frequency range. Pole-zero fits to measurements over this range are achieved with an average RMS relative error of less than 3% with 12 poles. Factoring the reflectance fit into its all-pass and minimum-phase components estimates the effect of the residual ear canal, allowing for comparison of the eardrum impedance and admittance across measurements. It was found that individual CAR magnitude variations for normal middle ears in the 1-4 [kHz] range often give rise to closely-placed pole-zero pairs, and that the locations of the poles and zeros in the s-plane may systematically differ between normal and pathological middle ears. This study establishes a methodology for examining the physical and mathematical properties of CAR using a concise parametric model. Pole-zero modeling accurately parameterizes CAR data, providing a foundation for detection and identification of middle ear pathologies. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled "MEMRO 2012".

J	Lobo, Gregory J.								Colombia, from failing state to a second independence: The politics and the price								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES				16	4			351	366		10.1177/1367877912460613			JUL 2013	2013	Amid social and political conditions that could well lead to Colombia being described in the terms of a failed state, the country's electorate chose alvaro Uribe as its thirty-ninth president in 2002, and again in 2006, preferring to keep in office a man who seemed to be putting the country together again, rather than respecting the constitutional prohibition against consecutive presidential terms. Though his presidency was marked by scandals and irregularities - most notably, the falsos positivos (false positives: young, poor Colombian civilians, assassinated in cold blood by the zealous armed forces and listed as guerrilla kills) - Uribe enjoyed approval ratings previously unknown in Colombian history. He is in fact credited with giving Colombia its second independence', and his leaving office was, for many, tragic. Here, I present an explanation for this paradox, analysing an aspect of Uribe's discourse for the way it contributed to producing a shared national sentiment by articulating a social imaginary with limited possibilities for making sense of Colombia. Drawing on Geertz, Durkheim and Brubaker and the concepts of hegemony and identification, I elucidate the effectiveness of Uribe's discourse of the nation in a context of a long experience of frustration and decadence, and show why and how so many Colombians could, at least for a time, give their overwhelming support to a regime wherein murder was authorized, unacknowledged as anything more significant than the price to be paid for that second independence.									0	0	0	0	0	1367-8779		WOS:000320502100003		
J	Burholt, Vanessa; Scharf, Thomas; Walsh, Kieran				chen, zhu/K-5923-2013				Imagery and imaginary of islander identity: Older people and migration in Irish small-island communities								JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES				31				1	12		10.1016/j.jrurstud.2013.01.007			JUL 2013	2013	This article examines the imagery and imaginaries of islander identity and makes an original contribution to the fields of gerontology and nissology. Drawing on data collected through in-depth interviews with 19 older residents of two small-island communities located off the island of Ireland, we address the central roles played by older people in creating and sustaining islander identities. Reflecting both public and private representations of islander identity, the article contrasts an island 'imagery' with an island 'imaginary', resulting in a complex 'imag(in)ery' of islander identity. We explore three main themes. To what extent do older residents of island communities perceive an 'imag(in)ery' of islander identity? In what ways do older islanders contribute to, substantiate or perpetuate the imag(in)ery of the islander identity? Are there alternative imag(in)eries of the islander identity for different groups of older people who live in island communities? Our analysis identified two imag(in)eries of islander identity. An historical islander identity was structured by the shared hardships and enforced self-sufficiency associated with residence in remote communities. Contemporary islander identities are founded on the positively perceived isolation of islands, an historical and cultural sense of belonging, frequent social interaction within cohesive, safe and secure communities, and a persistence of 'traditional' values. Older people were actively engaged in the (re)production of islander identity, such as helping visitors discover their island origins, producing traditional cultural artefacts, passing knowledge of culture down through the generations, and acting to maintain the civic life of the island community. Knowledge of local and traditional skills imbued some older islanders with the ability to perform island-specific symbolic rituals. Our study revealed subtle forms of differentiation between over-arching categories of island residents based on migration histories.

J	Schinkel, Willem								The imagination of "society' in measurements of immigrant integration								ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES				36	7	SI		1142	1161		10.1080/01419870.2013.783709			JUL 1 2013	2013	My aim in this contribution is to clarify in which way social scientific measurements of immigrant integration operate as a form of social imagination', that is, of the routinized and professionalized visualization of social life. Through such measurements, images of society' are produced that feed into larger social imaginaries. My discussion takes as an example Dutch discourse and research on integration. Crucial to the constitution of society in the Netherlands and many other Western European countries is what I call a culturist discourse that has many similarities to racism. This discourse demarcates the boundaries of society by rendering objectively observable the non-integrated who are considered to reside outside society'. The image of society thereby produced is that of a morally cleansed realm: social problems are relegated to the domain outside society', consisting of persons in need of integration.									2	0	0	0	2	0141-9870		WOS:000320573600002		
J	van Duinen, Jared								Playing to the 'imaginary grandstand': sport, the 'British world', and an Australian colonial identity								JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HISTORY				8	2			342	364		10.1017/S1740022813000259			JUL 2013	2013	This article argues for the importance of an exploration of sporting interactions in the British world. In addition, it presents the case for the adaptation of borderlands theory to the British world framework. Such study of British world borderlands is capable of more accurately capturing the spatial and regional variety of this British world and, in particular, the nascent national identities of dominions such as Australia. Sport is a particularly apt vehicle for the examination of such issues in an Australian context, since playing to the 'imaginary grandstand' of international spectators has always occupied a central role in the construction of an Australian national identity. This article uses three brief case studies - cricket, swimming, and Australian Rules football - to explore these theoretical claims.									0	0	0	0	0	1740-0228		WOS:000319997500008

Susan								'WITH SCENES OF BLOOD AND PAIN' Crime Control and the Punitive Imagination of The Meth Project								BRITISH JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY				53	4			605	623		10.1093/bjc/azt008			JUL 2013	2013	This article takes aim at an image-based methamphetamine (meth) intervention programme in the United States, to reveal disparate images of meth users organized along a binary system of value, pitting the sexual vulnerabilities of young women against the violent predation of young men. We argue the programme structures a particular visuality or way of seeing the supposed ills of meth use that agitates white middle-class social anxieties, through a 'meth epidemic' unfairly imagined as 'white' and 'rural'. Following self-justifying drug war logics, the project battles an epidemic it helps to create and sustain. Thus, we see the programme as an important site of cultural production where its punitive visualities contribute to structures of ideological penal policies and practices or 'imaginary penalities' that obfuscate alternatives for harm reduction and the ills of the neo-liberal order.									6	0	0	0	6	0007-0955		WOS:000320453900005		
J	Hackney, Fiona								Quiet Activism and the New Amateur: The Power of Home and Hobby Crafts								DESIGN AND CULTURE				5	2			169	193		10.2752/175470813X13638640370733			JUL 2013	2013	This article contributes to debates about the expanded, and expanding, nature of crafts by exploring the activist potential of amateur, domestic crafts and the quiet activism of everyday making. In contrast to much recent work on the resurgence of interest in DIY craft culture, it takes a historical perspective and argues for the emergence of a new, historically conscious, socially engaged amateur practice. The recently exhibited cross-stitch embroideries of Major Alexis Casdagli and my own memories of my grandmother provide a starting point for exploring the lived experience of home crafts in the first half of the twentieth century. Close analysis of home-craft features from 1930s women's magazines offer a framework for understanding how such marginalized spaces promote agency through new feminine imaginaries. Michel be Certeau's notion of Ia perruque suggests how such devalued activities as crochet and knitting can be envisaged as strategies or tactics that afford agency and shape distinctive social relations, while interviews with two contemporary practitioners provide insight into historical continuities and current responses.									1	0	0	0	1	1754-7075		WOS:000320744400003

Discussing responses to the so-called Uganda plan of 1903-5 and notions of Jewish colonisation in Africa and elsewhere, the article investigates demarcations of Jewishness from, and identifications with, blackness' in the early twentieth-century German Zionist press and literature and their impact on the Zionist imaginary vis-a-vis the colonial paradigm. Particular attention is given to Max Jungmann's Briefe aus Neu-Neuland', published in the satiric journal Schlemiel between 1903-7. It is argued that with his fictitious account of the Zionist settlement of East Africa (which historically never happened) and with the creation of the black African Mbwapwa Jumbo and his conversion to Judaism Jungmann articulates an intricate and critical response to colonial aspirations, Jewish or otherwise, and formulates a scathing but highly perceptive commentary on the convergence of Zionist, racial, and colonial discourses.									0	0	0	0	0	0016-8777		WOS:000320471900002		
J	Smith, Eric D.; Englander, Zoe A.; Lillard, Angeline S.; Morris, James P.								Cortical mechanisms of pretense observation								SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE				8	4			356	368		10.1080/17470919.2013.807872			JUL 1 2013	2013	Pretend play emerges in children the world over around 18 months and continues into adolescence and even adulthood. Observing and engaging in pretense are thought to rely on similar neural mechanisms, but little is known about them. Here we examined neural activation patterns associated with observing pretense acts, including high-likelihood, low-likelihood, and imaginary substitute objects, as compared with activation patterns when observing parallel real acts. The association between fantasy predisposition and cortical representations of pretense was also explored. Supporting prior research that used more limited types of pretense, observed pretense acts, when contrasted with real acts, elicited activity in regions associated with mentalizing. A novel contribution here is that substitute object pretense (high- and low-likelihood) elicited significantly more activity than imaginary (pantomime) acts not only in theory of mind regions but also in the superior parietal lobule, a region thought to aid in the prediction and error-monitoring of motor actions. Finally, when high-likelihood pretense acts were contrasted with real acts, participants with elevated fantasy predispositions evidenced significantly different activation patterns than their more reality-prone peers. Future research will explore the intersection of fantasy predisposition and experience with the neural representation of pretense.									0	0	0	0	0	1747-0919		WOS:000320912000009	23802124	
J	Hao, Xiaofei; Ryan, Chris								INTERPRETATION, FILM LANGUAGE AND TOURIST DESTINATIONS: A CASE STUDY OF HIBISCUS TOWN, CHINA								ANNALS OF TOURISM RESEARCH				42				334	358		10.1016/j.annals.2013.02.016			JUL 2013	2013	The link between films and destination promotion has been well established. Less well examined is the role of 'film language' in the subsequent reconstruction of tourist destinations. This paper suggests that the way a film 'speaks' to its audience helps both shape tourists' imaginaries of place, and the ways a place is reconstructed to meet tourist perceptions. For film tourism, 'film language' acts as a guidebook describing first the spaces where the film plots happened, second, shaping images of the places in an audience's mind, and third, serving as a blueprint for the physical reconstruction of spaces to replicate the place representation shown in the film. This both meets and reinforces the perceptions held by audiences. Therefore, this paper suggests interpretation of 'film language' is a key to the promotion of destination image and transformation of a place. Based on the case study of the Chinese film Hibiscus Town (Xie Jin, 1986), some key parts of its 'film language' are interpreted with reference to the visual, and a relationship between film language and place reconstruction is discussed.									2	0	0	0	2	0160-7383		WOS:000321161300016		
J	Sanchez-Escalonilla, Antonio								Indiewood and Narratives of the Crisis: the Validity of New Deal's Domestic Archetype.								ATALANTE-REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS CINEMATOGRAFICOS					16			71	+					JUL-DEC 2013	2013	According to Ross and May, John Ford and Frank Capra stand out among film directors linked to conversion narratives, due to their role in shaping the pattern of the American home during the New Deal, especially by means of The Grapes of Wrath and It's a Wonderful Life. Seven decades later, the presence of this archetype in modern crisis narratives can be recognized in films directed by Jonathan Dayton, Valerie Faris, Jason Reitman or Tom McCarthy: four independent filmmakers who have explored the social trends of a country, first shocked by 9/11 social trauma and, seven years later, under a worldwide economic collapse. This paper aims to explore the effect of this domestic imaginary within films by the mentioned directors, all of them interested in the stories of ordinary citizens whose homes are menaced by a crisis of economic nature, but also of a social, moral and politic one.									0	0	0	0	0	1885-3730		WOS:000321032300012		
J	Landy, David; Silbert, Noah; Goldin, Aleah								Estimating Large Numbers								COGNITIVE SCIENCE				37	5			775	799		10.1111/cogs.12028			JUL 2013	2013	Despite their importance in public discourse, numbers in the range of 1 million to 1 trillion are notoriously difficult to understand. We examine magnitude estimation by adult Americans when placing large numbers on a number line and when qualitatively evaluating descriptions of imaginary geopolitical scenarios. Prior theoretical conceptions predict a log-to-linear shift: People will either place numbers linearly or will place numbers according to a compressive logarithmic or power-shaped function (Barth & Paladino, 2011; Siegler & Opfer, 2003). While about half of people did estimate numbers linearly over this range, nearly all the remaining participants placed 1 million approximately halfway between 1 thousand and 1 billion, but placed numbers linearly across each half, as though they believed that the number words "thousand, million, billion, trillion" constitute a uniformly spaced count list. Participants in this group also tended to be optimistic in evaluations of largely ineffective political strategies, relative to linear number-line placers. The results indicate that the surface structure of number words can heavily influence processes for dealing with numbers in this range, and it can amplify the possibility that analogous surface regularities are partially responsible for parallel phenomena in children. In addition, these results have direct implications for lawmakers and scientists hoping to communicate effectively with the public.									1	0	1	0	1	0364-0213		WOS:000321211500001	23819823

This article introduces this IDS Bulletin and examines Brazilian and Chinese agricultural development cooperation in Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. A wide variety of forms of support are seen, involving different financial modalities, including aid, concessional loans, trade deals and commercial investment. Our focus is on the encounters' that occur during negotiations and the intersection of wider framing discourses with practices on the ground in particular projects. Brazilian and Chinese domestic political dynamics, competing social imaginaries and histories of agrarian change all shape development cooperation. Meanwhile, African governments are not just passive recipients; they exert agency in negotiations, trading off different players. Outcomes depend on the particular context, and the new aid and investment scene in African agriculture is highly varied, presenting opportunities as well as challenges for the future.									3	0	0	0	3	0265-5012		WOS:000321189700001

Africa is a major destination and agriculture tops the list of priority fields on intervention, with Embrapa leading cooperation projects. But patterns of cooperation in Africa are changing as other public, private and civil society actors enter the realm of cooperation and bring along contrasting narratives and experiences of agricultural development. This article maps the evolving nature of Brazilian development cooperation in agriculture and discusses emerging features of the Brazil-Africa encounter, considering knowledge framings, policy narratives, imaginaries and the motivations driving a diversity of technical and political actors.									1	0	0	1	2	0265-5012		WOS:000321189700005		
J	Bikmen, Nida; Sunar, Diane								Difficult dialogs: Majority group members' willingness to talk about inequality with different minority groups								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS				37	4			467	476		10.1016/j.ijintrel.2012.11.002			JUL 2013	2013	The present study explored attitudes of a majority group, Turks, toward dialog with two minority groups, Kurds and Armenians, in Turkey. We examined whether Turks would be equally likely to avoid discussing inequality (power talk) in imaginary dialogs with Kurds and Armenians, two groups that while equally devalued differ in their likelihood of being considered ingroup members. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that because Turks share a common religious identity with Kurds but not with Armenians, they would be more willing to engage in power talk with Kurds than with Armenians. In addition, we explored the role of intergroup contact, majority group identification (Turkish and Muslim), social dominance orientation (SDO), and the legitimizing ideologies of belief in cultural diversity and perceptions of ethnic discrimination as predictors of willingness for power talk with each group. Ethnic Turks were more willing to talk about commonalities with both minority groups, and less willing to talk about power inequalities with either group, even less so with Armenians than with Kurds. As expected, this difference was moderated by religious identification, such that Turks with stronger Muslim identification were more willing to have power talk with Kurds but not with Armenians. These findings point to the importance of common ingroup identity in majority members' responses to different minority groups. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Layne, Linda L.								"Creepy,' "freaky,' and "strange': How the "uncanny' can illuminate the experience of single mothers by choice and lesbian couples who buy "dad'								JOURNAL OF CONSUMER CULTURE				13	2	SI		140	159		10.1177/1469540513482600			JUL 2013	2013	Ethnographic accounts of the kinship practices that emerged in the last few decades with the help of assisted reproductive technologies frequently used the concepts of normalization' and naturalization' to explain how pioneers' of these family forms dealt with their novel experiences. The normalization/naturalization framework, I argue, obscures dimensions of the experiences of single women and lesbian couples who buy donor' sperm; I use the concepts of the canny,' the uncanny,' confabulation,' and poetic license' to illuminate these dimensions. Despite, and because of, the fact that these women buy sperm in order to obviate unwanted kin ties with the biological father, the existential status of the sperm and the absent presence of the biological father generate unease. With remarkable frequency, published memoirs of these maverick moms are peppered with synonyms for the uncanny' - creepy', freaky' and strange'. The practices of sexing, naming, clothing, photographing, treating as imaginary correspondents or conversation partners, and purchasing symbolically-related consumer goods and services are used, often with poetic license', not just to make the strange familiar, but also to accentuate the strangeness of their relationship with the absent presence of the biological father.									0	0	0	0	0	1469-5405		WOS:000321670300005

In the story of a patient, Bion reconstructs two sessions that are all the more true for being imaginary-i.e., narrated ("dreamed"). The matter of language and style in psychoanalysis is of the utmost importance, according to Bion-one could say, literally, a matter of life or death. In Bion's discourse, writing, reading, and analysis converge in the same place, the author notes; all are significant if they involve an experience of truth and the ability to learn from experience.									0	0	0	0	0	0033-2828		WOS:000322362700003	23824649	
J	Doucet, Caroline; Joubrel, Dina; Cremniter, Didier								Postimmediate intervention of medical and psychological emergency units: Clinical and psychopathological study of 20 group psychological debriefings								ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES				171	6			399	403		10.1016/j.amp.2013.04.012			JUL 2013	2013	Objectives. Group psychological debriefings belong to the various ways of treating mental trauma. Methodological and temporal structuring of group psychological debriefings is likely to highlight subjective impacts along with the evolution of the psychodynamic functioning which has been damaged by the tragic event. This contribution presents the clinical and psychopathological analysis of twenty group psychological debriefings made by the medical and psychological emergency unit of Ile-et-Vilaine (Bretagne region, France) following sudden deaths.Method. This study goes by the 20 "intervention reports" which have been systematically written by the unit workers after each debriefing. These documents mention: the nature of the request, the number of the group psychological debriefings made for each event, the number of persons taking part of the group, the themes brought up during the debriefing development, the presence of symptoms following the event, the offer of individual consultations to some participants, the debriefing length and its subsequently possible continuation. The twenty analysed debriefings have been put in place following fourteen different events (10 suicides, three sudden deaths, an accident on the public highway), considering that several debriefings might have been organized for one same situation. The results show: 1/ the effects on the mental functioning of the event in regard to the inventory of thoughts - or the lack of them -, affects, body manifestations, appearing at the moment of the event or its announcement; 2/ the symptomatology and psychopathological reactions that have occured since the event; 3/ the limited or lasting effects of the event on the psychodynamic functioning and the resumption of mental work that can be noticed from the evocation of perceptions about the future.Results. - Results hightlight mental upheavals linked to the trauma from initial disruption to the subsequent mental reorganization, depending on their limited or lasting evolution since the event till the debriefing and its regression phase. The research lists the adapted stress reaction signs and the trauma syndrom signs brought up during the debriefing, as well as the evolutive mental movements likely to avoid the fixation of the traumatic event. Results shows that, while some reveal real trauma syndroms requiring an individual psychotherapeutic treatment, trauma trivialization shall not hide the fact that not all sudden events are automatically traumatic but generally trigger an adapted stress reaction. Suicide cases, particularly at the workplace, imply a narcissistic imaginary breach, whether direct or linked to the image of the firm depending on its function to the subject involved, which is propitius for traumatic breach. Adapted stress reaction is generally noted, probably because of the nature of the events studied in this research: the-announcement of someone's sudden death - whose corpse was not discovered by those persons - without any threat against their own lives, which some call "secondarytraumatization". Hence a rather favourable and more or less rapid evolution of symptomatology, even if only a long-term epidemiological study could assess the presence of postponed, or even chronicized, symptoms.Conclusion. - At a scientific level, group debriefings throw light on clinical and psychopathological impacts on many people confronted with a same event which can be potentially traumatic. They also confirm the subjective dimension of the trauma. The study allows to assert that a debriefing contributes to relieve early distress and initiates, if need be, a psychotherapeutic treatment.

J	Amir, Dana								The Chameleon Language of Perversion								PSYCHOANALYTIC DIALOGUES				23	4			393	407		10.1080/10481885.2013.810487			JUL 1 2013	2013	This paper offers two understandings of the perverse structure's attack on meaningfulness and liveliness: the first one relates to perversion as a chameleon language, which adopts the other's discursive characteristics in order to invade and subjugate him or her. According to this understanding, the perverse subject's exact identification of the other's needs is not a true identification of one's internal reality, but rather a pseudo-identification that relies on the perverse ability to adopt the other's discursive features. The second understanding refers to perversion as emerging from an empty and hermetic primal scene, which is not an imaginary scene between three (a mother, a father, and a child who imagines them in his or her absence) but rather between two: a child and a dead object whom she or he conceives in order to be born. A detailed analytic case study demonstrates how the primal perverse scene is reenacted and worked through within the analytic scene.									0	0	0	0	0	1048-1885		WOS:000322864500003		
J	Yang, Wan-I								The Decline of Metaphysics: The Metaphysical Meaning Made by the Imaginary and the Visual Virtuality								UNIVERSITAS-MONTHLY REVIEW OF PHILOSOPHY AND CULTURE				40	7			165	180					JUL 2013	2013	The transcendental value in the traditional philosophy relies on the metaphysical sphere, which departs from the value of the real and takes it as truth. The metaphysical feature emerges as thus: the domination of the metaphysical value away from the world imposed on the real world. The "Man" in the metaphysical sense suggests the unachievable truth of Dasein from transcendental highness. The "Man" attempts to unearth the mystery of Being by language while bearing the irreducible distance between life and metaphysical truth. Despite life that acts against the metaphysical truth, despite the man that cannot grasp the eternal, the awe of looking upward at the highness of the sky still reveals the transcendental nature of man. After Nietzsche announced the death of God, he announced the disconnection between metaphysical value and Being as well. For the "Man" who experiences the disconnection between value and Being and yet who achieves the metaphysical nature, how would he face the self and aspires after the transcendental nature? How would he interpret the metaphysical meaning out of "Being"? The paper seeks to explain the metaphysical meaning constructed by the visual virtuality on the one hand, and attempts to illuminate how this metaphysical meaning can shed light on our age of the Internet virtual world on the other hand. The above explanation furthers to explore whether the metaphysical essence revealed by the virtual world can have a new possibility of life for bringing the men away from the traditional ancient world.									0	0	0	0	0	1015-8383		WOS:000322854900011

Thus, a return to ever more local policies and ideologies can be observed on many levels: traditions, rules, languages, visions, and imaginaries are affected. In this article, I suggest that we are currently experiencing a re/nationalisation in spite of (or perhaps because of) multiple globalising tendencies. Thus, citizenship and language tests are being or have already been introduced to all European nation states, thus emphasizing a revival of the national language as constitutive for access to employment, housing, or education and promising achievement of successful integration. In this way, migrants are perceived as having a deficit even if manifold tests provide evidence that native speakers (of German, for example) might also lack many language skills.									0	0	0	0	0	1534-8458		WOS:000326466700004

Some of the most representative texts of history for schools in the region were selected as the source and object of study; through them, are analyzed and identified aspects closely related to independence, such as national identity, the citizenship formation processes, the construction of the nation state and the role of the Caribbean region as founder of the new republican regime in those times. The paper places special emphasis on the analysis of historiographical and pedagogical trends pertaining to the textbooks analyzed and which eventually undoubtedly influenced the type of representation and collective imaginary about the process of independence embodied in these artifacts of ideological and cultural character.	Este trabajo aborda, desde la perspectiva histórica, las formas de representación del proceso independentista presentes en los manuales escolares que circularon en las escuelas de la región Caribe colombiana durante el siglo XX.

El artículo hace especial énfasis en el análisis de las tendencias historiográficas y pedagógicas a las que pertenecen los manuales escolares analizados y las cuales, indudablemente, terminaron por influenciar en el tipo de representaciones e imaginarios colectivos que sobre el proceso de independencia fueron plasmados en estos artefactos de carácter ideológico y cultural.								0	0	0	0	0	2011-7574		SCIELO:S0121-32612013000200002		
J	Hsiao, Fu-Jung; Wang, Yuh-Jen; Yan, Sui-Hing; Chen, Wei-Ta; Lin, Yung-Yang								Altered Oscillation and Synchronization of Default-Mode Network Activity in Mild Alzheimer's Disease Compared to Mild Cognitive Impairment: An Electrophysiological Study								PLOS ONE				8	7					e68792	10.1371/journal.pone.0068792			JUL 11 2013	2013	Some researchers have suggested that the default mode network (DMN) plays an important role in the pathological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To examine whether the cortical activities in DMN regions show significant difference between mild AD from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), electrophysiological responses were analyzed from 21 mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 21 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients during an eyes closed, resting-state condition. The spectral power and functional connectivity of the DMN were estimated using a minimum norm estimate (MNE) combined with fast Fourier transform and imaginary coherence analysis. Our results indicated that source-based EEG maps of resting-state activity showed alterations of cortical spectral power in mild AD when compared to MCI. These alterations are characteristic of attenuated alpha or beta activities in the DMN, as are enhanced delta or theta activities in the medial temporal, inferior parietal, posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. With regard to altered synchronization in AD, altered functional interconnections were observed as specific connectivity patterns of connection hubs in the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and medial temporal regions. Moreover, posterior theta and alpha power and altered connectivity in the medial temporal lobe correlated significantly with scores obtained on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). In conclusion, EEG is a useful tool for investigating the DMN in the brain and differentiating early stage AD and MCI patients. This is a promising finding; however, further large-scale studies are needed.									4	0	4	0	4	1932-6203		WOS:000322218800045	23874766

In this study, we measured spontaneous neural activity by means of magnetoencephalography in 13 patients with brain damage and 5 control subjects. To study the relationship between functional connectivity at rest and severity of USN symptoms, we determined the imaginary coherence values relating to the inter-hemispherical ventral and dorsal attentional networks, as well as the clinical severity of USN using neuropsychological tests and behavioral rating scales. The present results showed that inter-hemispherical connectivity in the ventral attentional network, especially between the left and right angular gyri, detected in the alpha band is associated with the severity of USN symptoms. This may suggest that connectivity of inter-hemispherical homologous regions of the ventral attentional network in the alpha band could be one of the biomarkers of attentional network imbalance occurring in patients with USN.									0	0	0	0	0	1932-6203		WOS:000324515600101	24023873	
J	Flear, Mark L.; Pickersgill, Martyn D.				SANT ANNA, LEONARDO/G-8739-2013				REGULATORY OR REGULATING PUBLICS? THE EUROPEAN UNIONS REGULATION OF EMERGING HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES AND CITIZEN PARTICIPATION								MEDICAL LAW REVIEW				21	1	SI		39	70		10.1093/medlaw/fws039			WIN 2013	2013	oCitizen participation' includes various participatory techniques and is frequently viewed as an unproblematic and important social good when used as part of the regulation of the innovation and implementation of science and technology. This is perhaps especially evident in debates around oanticipatory governance' or oupstream engagement'. Here, we interrogate this thesis using the example of the European Unions regulation of emerging health technologies (such as nanotechnology). In this case, citizen participation in regulatory debate is concerned with innovative objects for medical application that are considered to be emergent or not yet concrete. Through synthesising insights from law, regulatory studies, critical theory, and science and technology studies, we seek to cast new light on the promises, paradoxes, and pitfalls of citizen participation as a tool or technology of regulation in itself. As such we aim to generate a new vantage point from which to view the values and sociotechnical imaginaries that are both odesigned-in' and odesigned-out' of citizen participation. In so doing, we show not only how publics (do not) regulate technologies, but also how citizens themselves are regulated through the techniques of participation.									0	0	0	0	0	0967-0742		WOS:000315418600003	23222171	
J	van Tongeren, Paul								Nihilism and morality								TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE				53	4			589	601					DEC 2013	2013	The term "nihilism" is often used as an invective to blame a person or a way of thinking. If used in that way there would be a simple opposition between "nihilism and morality" That opposition could maybe point to a practical problem, but certainly not to a theoretical one. If however, we follow Fr. Nietzsche's analysis of what he calls "the European nihilism" we must conclude that morality is not so much the opposite of nihilism, but rather itself nihilistic. The inescapable nihilistic "catastrophe" (Nietzsche is never afraid of big words) arises as soon as morality discovers its own nihilist features, which - according to him - is happening at present. The problem indicated in the title refers to the question what could be the result of this self-undermining discovery; and if morality survives - as it seems to be the case - how is this at all possible?In my elaboration of this problem I focus on a particular element of our moral tradition. That tradition can in general be summarized in the three well-known ethical positions: utilitarianism or consequentialism, Kantianism or duty-ethics and eudaimonism or virtue-ethics. In the historical development of the latter, the introduction of Christianity in Western culture was responsible for some additional virtues that were strongly different from the Greek ones. These explicitly religious virtues seem strangely enough nevertheless to survive in our present secular context. The question how this survival is possible is being stressed in the article by describing our contemporary situation in the light of Nietzsche's analysis of nihilism.For Nietzsche "nihilism" refers first and foremost to the platonic-christian tradition in which reality is denied or "annihilated" through the fictitious construction of a "true world". This annihilated world can, however, also itself be called "nihilistic", in the sense that this world (this "reality" which is denied by the platonic construction) is characterized by chaos and absurdity. The event of the so-called "death of God" is the collapse of the imaginary construction of the Christian-platonic world. This event characterizes the present age according to Nietzsche. Literary imagination since the 19th century gives us a picture of what it would mean to live in this situation. If we cannot live without morality, what would living under these nihilistic conditions mean? Nietzsche explains why nihilism is a catastrophe, but nevertheless, at least for the time being, remains unnoticed to most people. In a certain sense God seems to survive his own death: platonic philosophy survives in the sciences as Christian morality does in contemporary humanism. But this survival is only relative and temporal. Sooner or later, the catastrophe will break through.Although Nietzsche sometimes speaks of an overcoming of nihilism, he does not seem to be able to conceptualize what that would consist of Nihilism is, according to him, the inevitable result of a process in which the platonic-Christian structure (most clearly in the form of its "will to truth") undermines itself The philosopher who understands and describes or even promotes this process cannot get any further than becoming himself the incarnation of the problem that he describes. But Nietzsche's self-descriptions seem to show that this paradoxical or even contradictory identity of the philosopher has a positive reverse side. On the one hand it is the untolerable aporia of not being able to believe in those fictions that one needs in order to live. On the other hand, however; it appears as the continuing attachment to those values and virtues that were undermined. Maybe we can still adhere to even the Christian virtues in a kind of parasitic attitude.									0	0	0	0	0	0041-4751		WOS:000328587700008
