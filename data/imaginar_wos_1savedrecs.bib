Abstract = {{This article argues that although Simone de Beauvoir goes as far as any
   philosopher in her analysis of oppressive myths, she too creates
   `others' for herself, such as children who believe in dreams or fairy
   tales. Beauvoirs The Second Sex appears to make a clear distinction
   between myths (mythologization) and facts with respect to women's
   situation. The first volume of her autobiography, Memoirs of a Dutiful
   Daughter, also critiques some of the myths which dominate women's
   lives; at the same time, the adoption of Simone's mythologies by her
   Younger sister Helene is presented less as a myth structure than as an
   eclectic collection of good and bad objects that strives for coherence
   only in fantasy. Like the Greeks, the young Simone sets herself against
   `the Barbarians'-to the embarrassment of the author. Myths and
   mythologies (including religion) are the enemies of philosophy for
   Hegel amongst others. Yet while Beauvoir is clear about the importance
   of emancipation from religion, she does not find it easy to situate
   herself as a philosopher (that is What we have done for her).
   Philosophy too has acted as an instrument of male domination. Perhaps
   Barthes's `mythologies' provided a more comfortable framework for the
   analysis of bourgeois life in her autobiography-which includes a (truly
   philosophical) crucial element of self-critique. Equally, looking back
   on her later life, it is striking to what extent she continued to act
   out bourgeois mythologies of the role of the accepting woman in the
   face of male infidelity, just as her mother did. Perhaps her ascetic
   refusal to offer a positive image of a female heroine relates to this
   problematic relationship to the imaginary, saturated from childhood
   with mythologies that she wished to reject, and critiqued by the
   rational philosophical tradition which cannot acknowledge its own use
   of fiction.}},

Volume = {{100}},

Pages = {{99-112}},
Abstract = {{Starting point of Naomi Schor's article is a statement that French
   literary criticism that refers to Lacan's considerations sees modern
   texts, primarily ``Bildungsroman{''} and autobiographies, as
   developmental saga. Maturation in such saga is understood here in
   accordance with Lacan's thought as a process of an individual's
   necessary passage from the Imaginary into the Symbolic, or a necessary
   abandonment of a minor stage for the law of the Father.
   Schor formulates a thesis that maturation story follows a different
   path from that of feminocentric examples of these genres i.e. such in
   which maturation of an individual is not linked with overcoming of the
   mirror stage but with regaining respect by it. It proves possible if
   the Imaginary is regarded not as a stage to be outgrown, but as an
   ineradicable constituent of human psyche. Schor proves her thesis when
   she analyses Balzac's novel Eugenie Graudet. The heroine of this 19(th)
   c. romance about nuclear family succeeds in combining the Imaginary
   with the Symbolic due to her social position: after the death of her
   parents she decides to marry a suitor of fortune equal to her under the
   condition that their marriage was not to be consumed. In this sense she
   is a virgin and at the same time a wife, thus lives in the world of the
   Father's law but does not surrender to them.}},

Abstract = {{Among the critical approaches to management and organizations, one has

   that Lacan's work is particularly relevant in addressing the question
   of subjectivity and of the construction of one's identity in the
   context of work. We then present the management education programme we
   have implemented in order to enable the participants to question their
   imaginary beliefs at work and to modify their place in the
   organizational narratives so as to recover new scope for action. A case
   study helps us illustrate the processes and the effects of the method

Abstract = {{The focus of this article is the concept of enacted destiny, which was

   a strong notion of free agency with a strong notion of a good,

   constituted by two components: 1. presituational religious empowerment
   by which charismatic Christians can reduce complexities, anxieties, and
   insecurities in the context of decision making; and 2. postsituational
   sense-making by which divine agency is ascribed to an originally
   ambiguous situation. Both components temporally embrace the actions of
   West African charismatic Christians in Berlin. Actions thereby become
   the means through which God becomes immanent in the everyday lives of
   West African charismatic Christians in Berlin and enacted destiny a
   category of movement toward convergence of human and divine agency.}},

Abstract = {{Drawing on data collected during 14 months of ethnographic research in

   In order to do this they constructed the image of an ideal `Guest', an
   image that was collectively evoked in order to shape the conduct of
   service encounters. We claim that these imaginary service encounters
   mean that the `creators' of this imaginary object become increasingly
   subjected to its demands. The object, `The Guest', attempts to dominate
   its creators. The traditional demarcation between subject and object is
   blurred, and perhaps reversed. Drawing on the neglected work of Gunther
   Anders, the paper inquires into the status of this object and addresses
   the process of its production and consumption. It demonstrates how
   subjects and an ( imaginary) object become entangled.}},

Abstract = {{This article both maps and analyses the representation of the Balkans
   in the work of Thomas Pynchon. It focuses primarily on the sustained
   treatment of diplomacy, empire and violence in the region that forms a
   key component of Against the Day (2006), but also traces how his
   earlier fiction is marked by this distinct zone of geo-political
   influence. The argument proceeds by situating Pynchon's portrait of the
   Balkans in a broader discursive context, placing special emphasis on
   the cultural/intellectual impact of the disintegration of the former
   Yugoslavia and on Maria Todorova's groundbreaking work on `balkanism'
   (a relative, in some senses, of Said's `Orientalism'). I explore how
   the representation of the Balkans, as an imaginative, mythic and
   material space, can be used to deepen our understanding of Pynchon's
   political sensibilities. Using a range of examples (from Balkan
   ethnomusicology to the depiction of the First Balkan War), the article
   demonstrates how an uncompromisingly complex vision of hegemony,
   resistance and the Western psyche emerges from Pynchon's novel. Drawing
   on the insights of Slavoj Zizek, I argue that Pynchon's lavish
   engagement with Balkan history and culture is not merely an example of
   the meta-fictional whimsy so often cited as a dominant characteristic
   of his work. Rather, it can be read in terms of a `committed' critical
   impulse that forces us to re-conceive of European power relations, as
   well as entrenched notions of liberal tolerance and multiculturalism.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we explored how dramatic enactments of scientific
   phenomena and concepts mediate children's learning of scientific
   meanings along material, social, and representational dimensions. These
   drama activities were part of two integrated science-literacy units,
   Matter and Forest, which we developed and implemented in six urban
   primary-school (grades 1st-3rd) classrooms. We examine and discuss the
   possibilities and challenges that arise as children and teachers
   engaged in scientific knowing through such experiences. We use
   Halliday's (1978. Language as social semiotic: The social
   interpretation of language and meaning. Baltimore, MD: University Park
   Press) three metafunctions of communicative activity-ideational,
   interpersonal, and textual-to map out the place of the multimodal drama
   genre in elementary urban school science classrooms of young children.
   As the children talked, moved, gestured, and positioned themselves in
   space, they constructed and shared meanings with their peers and their
   teachers as they enacted their roles, Through their bodies they
   negotiated ambiguity and re-articulated understandings, thus marking
   this embodied meaning making as it powerful way to engage with science.
   Furthermore, children's whole bodies became central, explicit tools
   used to accomplish the goal of representing this imaginary scientific
   world, as their teachers helped them differentiate it from the real
   world of the model they were enacting. Their bodies operated on
   multiple mediated levels: as material objects that moved through space,
   as social objects that negotiated classroom relationships and rules,
   and as metaphorical entities that stood for water molecules in
   different states of matter or for plants, animals. or non-living
   entities in a forest food web. Children simultaneously negotiated
   meanings across all of these levels, and in doing so, acted out
   improvisational drama as they thought and talked science. (C) 2009

   elevated to an idealized `public sphere on wheels' in the bright

   needs to be eradicated and in the second account the embodied driver is

   The Power and Poetry of Song (C39), which analyses the work of Violeta

   with the young woman to whom the lecture is dedicated (Kate Elder), to
   the prolonged consideration of two songs, particularly Violeta Parra's
   now iconic `Gracias a la vida'. Pring-Mill eloquently follows the move
   from the introspective to the public, to a sense of shared community
   that Violeta Parra traces in her song. It is this move that I then
   develop by close readings of her Decimas: autobiografta en verso
   (1959), placing them in the context of the cultural turns of popular
   poetry, and the genealogies to which her writing - and its study -
   belong. The essay then seeks to place Parra's work within a broader
   poetics that spans the popular, orality and the written, situating it
   in the force of wilful marginality from a state that is traditionally

Abstract = {{As Turkey set its sights on modernization and Westernization in the

   stage. The state used clothing as a constitutive element in its

   it. Today there exists an extensive regulatory regime on clothing and
   appearance in the public sphere, which induces those governed by it to
   dress in a ``modern{''} fashion. An examination of these regulations
   reveals the deeply politicized nature of clothing in Turkey which is
   guided by the assumption that you are what you wear. While choice of
   clothing and appearance is neither entirely free nor fully prescribed,
   dress codes do further restrict already limited choices. Dress codes
   undermine the relationship thought to exist between individual belief
   and appearance. Dress codes, in the case of Turkey, are dictated by the
   state; therefore, the appearance of students and state employees does
   not necessarily represent their belief but that of the state. The
   Turkish state, through the use of dress codes, continues to try and

Abstract = {{Recent feminist scholarship has shown that women's anteriority to `the

   temporality that structures the trope of feminine timelessness is
   marked by instabilities and contradictions. Fashion, I argue, makes
   apparent these instabilities. Approaching the debates on modern
   temporality through the lens of fashion adds complexity to theories of
   women's positioning vis-a-vis modernity, showing that women were
   invoked simultaneously as modernity's antitheses and its exemplars. I

   useful framework for understanding the variable visibility of women in

Abstract = {{The study examines whether speakers exaggerate prosodic cues to

   syntactically ambiguous sentences like Touch the cat with the spoon
   intending to convey either an instrument (high attachment) or a
   modifier (low attachment) interpretation. Mothers produced longer
   segments and pauses in child-directed speech (CDS) compared to
   adult-directed speech (ADS). However, in CDS, mothers lengthened
   post-nominal pauses in both the instrument and the modifier sentences
   to a similar extent thereby failing to disambiguate between the two
   interpretations. In contrast, non-mothers provided reliable prosodic
   disambiguation cues in CDS by producing post-nominal pauses that were
   longer in instrument than modifier sentences. Experiment 5, using
   ratings from 50 participants, determined that expressed positive affect
   was higher in the CDS of mothers than of non-mothers. Negative
   correlations between vocal affect and degree of prosodic disambiguation
   in CDS compared to ADS suggest that there may be a trade-off between

Abstract = {{During their first Australasian tour in 1909-1910, Oscar Asche and Lily
   Brayton produced costumed `recitals' of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar in
   the town halls of Sydney and Melbourne. While the landscape has been
   privileged as the major site of the Australian settler imaginary and
   its labours of familiarisation, settler investments in their built
   urban spaces have been less studied. The social and political
   specificities of these two major colonial buildings-their choices of
   architectural rhetoric, sitings in urban space and histories of civic
   use and access-frame the meanings of Asche's spare mise en scene for
   Shakespeare's play. The text of Julius Caesar, itself a resonant
   meditation on the titular character as historical `ghost', becomes
   additionally `haunted' (in Marvin Carlson's phrase) by audience
   knowledge of the history and typical usages of the politically
   contested structures in which it was encountered. As he had done for
   Beerbohm Tree's lavish 1898 production, Asche performed the role of
   Mark Antony. Yet for his `recitals' in these Australian found spaces,
   where he both used and obscured the architectural features of the
   magnificent interiors, his aesthetic rather engaged elements of
   modernist bare staging and lighting ideas familiar from the work of

Abstract = {{We measured electroencephalographic activity during visual search of a

   followed by a single shape (post-cue), and the task was to decide
   whether the post-cue was or was not in the previously displayed
   search-array. We focused on early lateralized electrical brain activity
   over posterior and temporal areas time-locked to search-arrays in
   pre-cue trials and to post-cues in post-cue trials. In Experiment 1,
   search-arrays were composed of two lateralized shapes, displayed in the

   N2pc-like activity with search-arrays composed of two shapes, that was

   shapes. For many aspects, attending to a perceptual object was
   functionally and neurally analogous to attending to an object held in

   not even attempt to reinterpret the chronology of musical styles. His
   historical narrative with only small adjustments follows the canon
   established in the late 19th century by Franjo Ksaver Kuhac, for whom
   it was more important to present the national origin of musicians than
   to demonstrate their mutual influences within the circle in which they
   were active. Andreis's history is constructed as a museum of Croatian
   and foreign composers active in Croatia, as well as Croatian musicians
   abroad, among whom some had not been connected to Croatia with their
   activities in any significant way. Besides nationalistic traits
   inherited from Kuhac, an additional reason for emphasizing activities
   of composers working abroad were the circumstances surrounding Andreis
   during the time of communist Yugoslavia, when Croatian connections with
   the Central European musical space were particularly appreciated,
   especially when the quality of composers living abroad surpassed the
   musical production within the country. Being part of multinational
   Yugoslavia, which was divided between Eastern and Western cultural and
   religious spheres, Croatians at the time felt the need to be reassured
   about their belonging to Slavia Latina and these composers provided
   such a link.
   Andreis constructed his historical narrative in a straight and
   one-directional line connecting Renaissance and Baroque composers of
   the Croatian urban centers along the coast with the 19th-century
   efforts in northern Croatia. Influenced by the notion formed by Kuhac
   that Vatroslav Lisinski was the founder and the most important composer
   in northern Croatia of the first half of the 19th century, he presented
   all other composers active until the mid-century as his followers, and
   as belonging to the group of composers of the Croatian National
   Movement. However, composers active and even finishing their careers
   before Lisinski started composing were also included among them. This
   created an apparent misconception that significant music life started
   in northern Croatia only in the 1830s, although in urban centers such
   as Zagreb, Varazdin, Dakovo, and even among the Croatian people of
   Subotica ( Vojvodina), the presence of the Classical style from the end
   of the 18th century can be recognized.
   Nineteenth-century music life in the coastal parts of Croatia received
   only marginal attention and superficial evaluation in Andreis's
   narrative. Dalmatia and Istria were multilingual and multicultural
   regions in the 19th century, and their music life was blending the
   Croatian and Italian characteristics. When Andreis was writing his
   historical overview, the international borders between Italy and
   Yugoslavia/Croatia were not fully settled as a consequence of the
   Italian administration governance over parts of Dalmatia and Istria
   between the two world wars. Their status was fully resolved only with
   the Osimo bilateral treaties between Italy and Yugoslavia, signed in
   1975. Writing about 19th-century music in these regions in any
   significant way, the author would have to recognize stylistic and
   cultural connections with Italy and, with that, potentially give
   supporting arguments to the Italian irredentist claims on Dalmatia and
   Istria. An additional factor for neglecting Italian composers was that
   Andreis was a true proponent of the Croatian national style in music
   and considered that only music by Croatian composers belonged to the
   canon of Croatian music history after the beginning of the 19th
   century. In a similar way he avoided a presentation of the activities
   of Serbian composers in Croatia in order to distance Croatian music
   from the cultural trends in the eastern parts of Yugoslavia. Under the
   circumstances of the communist administration in Croatia, he also
   stopped short of discussing the music and activities of Roman and Greek
   Catholic composers and musicians.}},

Month = {{FAL}},
Abstract = {{The preponderance of gothic themes in Italian operas of the early
   nineteenth century is often cited as one of the few ways essentially
   conservative Italian composers flirted with the Romantic revolution
   sweeping the rest of Europe. By 1838, the very ubiquity of these tropes
   led the Venetian reviewer of Donizetti's gory Maria de Rudenz to plead
   ``exhaustion{''} with the ever-present ``daggers, poisons, and
   tombs{''} of the contemporary stage. Based on the French melodrama La
   Nonne sanglante, Donizetti's sensational opera is almost a litany of
   gothic tropes. The most disturbing of these is the female body that
   refuses to die: Maria herself, who rises from the dead to murder her
   innocent rival. This fleshy specter is musically rendered as a body
   that is too receptive to emotion, particularly to (imaginary) cries of
   longing or grief. Significantly, Donizetti's foray into the gothic was
   also distinguished by a spate of self-borrowing; his 1838 revision of
   the earlier Gabriella di Vergy borrows material from Maria de Rudenz.
   Exploring the connections between the trope of gothic resurrection and
   Donizetti's borrowings highlights how the two works represent a
   characteristic approach to the gothic, one that mingles a corporeal
   orientation with more familiar themes of ghostly immateriality.}},

   Mont Bego area. The cosmogonic myths of the early metallurgic settlers

Journal = {{ANTHROPOLOGIE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{5, Part 2}},
Pages = {{969-1004}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{More than 100,000 graphic signs, of which 40,000 are figurative, were
   carved on around 4000 rocks in the mont Bego region, in Tende, in the
   southern Alps, approximately 80 km north of Nice (Alpes-Maritimes).
   These carved rocks are dispersed at an altitude of 2000 to 2700 m in
   the high valleys surrounding mont Bego and are regrouped in seven
   different sectors: the Merveilles valley, Valaurette, val de
   Fontanalba, val de Sainte-Marie, Valmasque, col du Sabion and the Vei
   del Bouc lake. The daggers, halberds and axes represented by these
   carvings make it possible to attribute them to Chalcolithic cultures,
   like the Remedello, or to early Bronze age cultures, like the Polada or
   the Rhodanian, and to date them between 3300 and 1800 years BC. Among
   the 40.000 figurative carvings, very few iconographic themes are
   represented: corniculates (about 70\% of all figurative carvings),
   harnesses (2.9\%), daggers (about 5.4\% of all figurative carvings),
   halberds (1.1\%), axes (0.08\%), reticulates (5.5\%), rectangular or
   oval shaded zones (6.9\%) and several rare anthropomorphous figures.
   The consistency of the techniques and of the iconographic themes shows
   that these carvings were not carried out at random. They correspond to
   a conception of the world, transmitted from generation to generation by
   way of a graphic code. These representations are in fact ideograms: by
   carving signs and symbols, these Chalcolithic and Bronze Age
   populations depicted real or imaginary objects and by combining them,
   they created ideas in relation to the natural or supernatural world.
   The rock carvings of the mont Bego region correspond to a symbolic
   language inscribed in stone at the end of the fourth millenium and
   throughout the third millennium BC., by the first metallurgic settlers
   in the southern Alps. The ideograms were thus inscribed on rocks
   polished by Quaternary glaciers in the sacred Bego mountain. These
   carvings, the works of agricultural and pastoral populations in the
   southern Alps during the Chalcolithic and the ancient Bronze age,
   translate not just the daily preoccupations of these populations who
   needed rain, sources and lakes in order to fertilise their fields, but
   also their cosmogonic myths. At the centre of these myths are the bull
   god, brandishing lightning, master of the storm and provider of
   fertilising rain, and the high goddess, mother goddess or goddess
   earth, who needs to be fertilised herself by rain from the sky in order
   to bring abundance to humans. (c) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{The study of the perception of space in oral tradition has shown, that
   people do not perceive space as a three-dimensional system in accord
   with the western model, but rather supplement the three visible
   dimensions with the fourth, which represents the yonderland. The
   intertwinement of the imaginary and real, the yonderland and this
   world, is denoted by the concept of the `footstep of mrak' (mrakova
   stopinja), an unpredictable and undescribable site within the landscape
   bearing real consequences for human existence (loss of orientation,
   death) People: established a certain set of rules, a logical system,
   which accurately defines the sites where the ``other{''} world enters
   into ``their{''} world.
   The entire system leans oil the structural logic of the boundary, which
   creates the qualification of space according to the principal of the
   binary logical system. The boundary is more than a line, it
   simultaneously represents the third element within the system, which
   functions as a mediator between the two contradicting sides it
   separates.
   The function of mediation between this world and the other has beers
   assumed by cadastral boundaries, as Indicated by numerous traditions
   concerning apparitions, immolations and burials of creatures existing
   between the two worlds (Bloody Thigh, Vedamec, Snake, Blacksmith,
   Unclean Dead, Foreigner, etc.). The article locuses on the ritual
   aspect of cadastral boundaries and thus supplements the perception of
   cadastral boundaries In folklore as the boundaries between the worlds
   of the living and the dead.
   Funerary activities, performed oil cadastral boundaries, can be traced
   In the phenomenon of the `dead resting site' (mrtva pocivala) on the
   path of the funeral procession, the purpose of which is to separate
   sharply the worlds of the dead and the living. They are ritual sites,
   where the funeral procession would stop, people would pray and
   pallbearers would exchange. According to the Informant, the funeral
   procession did not stop to rest, but rattler to honour a custom A
   crucial piece of Information is the fact that dead resting sites are
   not picked at random, but lie at or near cadastral boundaries. From
   this point of view it becomes clear why ritual activities took place In
   these particular sites which also corresponds to the theory of
   transition or transcending rituals, which represent all integral part
   of the traditional concept of boundary.
   An exception among the dead resting sites, which normally lie near
   cadastral boundaries, is the site on the funeral procession path
   between Brezovica and Povirje, which is situated near the water.
   Several traditions from the Karst region confirm the hypothesis, that
   In traditional culture, water represented a boundary as well as the
   associating medium between the worlds of the living and the dead. The
   record concerning dead resting sites near the water speaks In favour of
   the hypothesis that In the Karst region, where surface water is scarce,
   the role of the passage to the yonderland was largely assumed by
   cadastral boundaries. It seems that water and cadastral boundaries bear
   a similar; perhaps even identical symbolic meaning In the concept of
   the world, structured upon the notion of the boundary
   The function of the boundary is not merely to separate contradicting
   sides, but also to establish a permanent contact between the worlds.
   From this scope, the concept of the supernatural does not seem to
   represent something exclusive and atrocious, but IS simply a
   consequence of the formation of a certain contradiction (Integrated
   Into the familiar landscape) in relation to which the equilibrium of
   the world is established In one of the aspects of reality.}},

   discourse of cultural self-fashioning. Not only did it reflect upon a
   newly-won sense of national expansion, visible in the U.S. policy in
   Cuba and the Philippines, it also helped to shape the belief in the
   large family as the essential core of a functioning society. By staging
   his own family as a `prototypical American' one, Roosevelt launched an

Abstract = {{Through ethnographic and archival research centered in Jaffa, this
   article analyzes how the image of the Jewish-Arab mixed city has been
   represented and (re) produced in the Zionist historical imagination
   since the establishment of the state of Israel to the present.
   Vacillating between romantic historicity and political violence, the
   image of Jaffa poses a political and hermeneutic challenge to the
   territorial project of urban Judaization, which ultimately failed to
   define and establish the national-cum-cultural identity of this
   ``New-Old{''} city. This failure, I argue, results in a persistent
   pattern of semiotic ambivalence which, from the Jewish-Israeli point of
   view, positions Jaffa both as a source of identity and longing (in the
   distant past) as well as a symbol of alterity and enmity (in the recent
   past)- an object of desire and fear alike. As such, Jaffa and other
   ethnically mixed towns (including Ramle, Lydda, Haifa, and Acre) occupy
   a problematic place in Israeli and Palestinian political and cultural
   imagination. A bi-national borderland in which Arabs and Jews live de
   facto together, these cities bring to the fore, on the one hand, the
   paradox of Palestinian citizens in a fundamentally Jewish state, while
   simultaneously suggesting, by the very spatial and social realization
   of ``mixed-ness,{''} the potential imaginary of its solution. Unfolding
   through four distinct historical modalities of urban Orientalism, this
   article historicizes the highly politicized image of the Jewish-Arab
   city and the discourse on its future. These discursive formations
   reconfigured the public space that enabled, paradoxically since the
   October 2000 events, new political claims for equal citizenship,
   bi-national cooperation, and Palestinian presence.}},

Abstract = {{The fundamental problem discussed in this article is the lack of accord
   between market adaptation and traditional production practices, which
   may result in a loss of competitiveness in some industries. A key
   question of this article is why salted fish consumers in Spain,
   formerly an important market for Norwegian salted fish producers, are
   seemingly unable to influence production practices within the Norwegian
   salted fish industry. The Norwegians have lost significant market share
   in Spain because of their failure to meet the demand for new products,
   which required different production methods. Based on institutional and
   evolutionary economic theories and focusing on production systems.
   institutional rigidity and path dependency, this article analyses two
   causes of market failure: the structural conditions for industrial
   adaptation; and mistrust among most of the core actors in the Norwegian
   salted fish industry. Mistrust is one significant reason for the
   failure to establish networks and collective innovation practices in
   order to adapt to market demands. The article concludes that, instead,
   actors in the seafood industry developed an `imaginary innovation
   system' in which they believed that they were innovative and
   competitive, whereas in reality they were defending individual
   positions within traditional production practices.}},

Abstract = {{In his paper ``Literature, Ideology and the Imaginary,{''} Marcello
   Potocco analyses the elusive relation between literature and ideology.
   The notion of the ``social imaginary{''} - as developed by Castoriadis
   - brings the possibility to reconsider the relation between the
   literary structure, its reception, and ideology. While ideology is seen
   as a radical expression of the social imaginary in modern society, it
   can only manifest itself through the ideological function, which does
   not necessarily destruct the aesthetic experience. In a literary
   structure, elements may exist that enable a strong identification with
   the extra-textual world, but this involves primarily identifications
   with significations of the social imaginary. In an ideological text,
   affective elements play a secondary role, while conceptual-rational,
   and subject-material elements provide the basis for the reader's
   identification. An ideological structure retains a largely
   conventional, ``pragmatic{''} relation between the signifiers and the
   signified, linking them to the social imaginary and, possibly, a
   uniform interpretative code. Nevertheless, the (non-)realization of the
   ideological function within a text always depends on the social,
   extra-textual codes of interpretation, since ideology can only
   interpellate as a socio-historical force imposed on a text.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Is the act of looking unavoidably accompanied by an act of
   identification (identifying), firstly in the sense of identifying a
   subject, and secondly of identifying objects as enduring?
   Identification of objects is here understood as the (unconscious)
   attribution of enduring identity or substantial sameness to objects in
   the human world, and of subjects as the experience or awareness of a
   relatively enduring identity or selfhood on the part of a human being.
   The exploration is taken in the direction of the structural dynamics of
   the `act of identifying'. Here the work of mainly Lacan, Nancy, Kant,
   Silverman and Kierkegaard (and to a lesser extent, that of Husserl and
   Deleuze) is employed to clarify the various aspects of `identifying'
   with someone or something. This includes Lacan's I mirror stage' in
   conjunction with his early elaboration on aggressivity, as well as his
   register of the symbolic as the repository of ethical norms, Nancy's
   phenomenology of the image, Kant's notions of apperception, of the
   empirical and the transcendental self, Silverman's understanding of
   desire, and Kierkegaard's different models of the self, namely, the
   aesthetic and the ethical. Employing the theoretical lenses referred to
   above, the focus is shifted towards an illuminating instance of visual
   and linguistic (imaginary and symbolic) viewer identification in cinema
   to be able to elaborate on the theoretical work in question, namely,
   Minghella's The Talented Mr Ripley. An interpretive analysis of this
   film reveals that the reason why identifying visually and symbolically
   with a protagonist in a cinematic narrative becomes painfully and
   uncomfortably apparent to a viewer when such protagonists unexpectedly
   perform unconscionable actions, is related to the primary and secondary
   identifications at the imaginary and symbolic levels, especially
   regarding the ethical import of the latter.}},

Journal = {{LISTY FILOLOGICKE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{132}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{289-301}},
Abstract = {{Many Czech Catholic authors turn to ancient inspirations at the end of
   the 1960's, after twenty years of exclusion from literature (Vaclav
   Renc, Klement Bochorak, Vladimir Vokolek, Josef Kostohryz). The
   antiquity often serves as a ``neutral{''} visual and imaginary space
   that does not arouse suspicion of communist censors, but in which
   Christian world-views, that cannot be expressed directly, can be
   projected disguisedly, and more or less enciphered. Josef Kostohryz
   (1907-1987) moreover originally transformed ancient inspirations at
   motivic and versological levels.
   At the motivic level, Kostohryz is concerned with the themes of fate
   and evil in the world. His books of poetry from the 1960's to 1980's
   depict the world as a scene of metaphysical drama of the powers of
   chaos against the powers of order. The powers of order are symbolized
   by female characters whose names refer predominantly to the antiquity -
   Parca, Ariadne, Eurydice, Muse, Medusa. The subject holds fragmentary
   conversations with them. Through these conversations and partly through
   mutual anagnorisis finally all these characters fuse in understanding
   that it is all about one character only - about one ``stern image{''},
   about the symbol of Fate.
   Parca, the foreteller of fate, occupies a central place. The motif of
   Parca also bears an aspect of irony regarding the poet's own literary
   beginnings linked to ``poesie pure{''} in the spirit of Paul Valery,
   for whom Parca was an emblematic figure.
   At the versological level, Kostohryz is inspired by ancient metre. He
   does not accept them as ready-made models, but uses them as an

   started even before he turned to antiquity - when his main source of
   inspiration was the verse of Otokar Brezina. In Kostohryz's books of
   poetry one can find regular inspiration by the elegiac distich, by
   hexameter and in some cases by other forms (Sapphic strophe). However,
   Kostohryz makes his verse of hexametrical cadence shorter or longer by
   one or even two feet. His aim is not to imitate ancient metre, but to
   find a ``narrow path{''} between formal freedom of the avant-garde and
   rigidity of neoclassical poetry. His verses oscillate between the
   syllabical principle and the tonal principle, between the orality of
   Brezina's style and the ``Antique{''} declamation.}},

Abstract = {{This article is based on new empirical, qualitative research with
   minority ethnic rugby league players in the southwest of France.
   Drawing on similar research on rugby league in the north and the south
   of England, the article examines how rugby league, traditionally viewed
   as a white, working-class male game (Collins, 2006; Denham, 2004;
   Spracklen, 1995, 2001) has had to re-imagine its symbolic boundaries as
   they are constituted globally and locally to accommodate the needs of
   players from minority ethnic backgrounds. In particular, the article
   examines the sense in which experiences of minority ethnic rugby league
   players in France compare with those of their counterparts in England
   (Spracklen, 2001, 2007), how rugby league is used in France to
   construct identity, and in what sense the norms associated with the
   imaginary community of rugby league are replicated or challenged by the
   involvement of minority ethnic rugby league players in France.
   Questions about what it means to be (provincial, national) French
   (Kumar, 2006) are posed, questions that relate to the role of sport in
   the construction of Frenchness, and in particular the role of rugby
   league (and union).}},

Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{125-140}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In June 2007, the city of Sheffield officially declared itself to be
   the UK's first `City of Sanctuary', a gesture that sought to instil a
   spirit of `welcome and hospitality towards asylum seekers and
   refugees'. Drawing on a series of interviews and ethnographic work,
   this paper critically examines this gesture by considering how City of
   Sanctuary sought to enact a relational account of place through which
   the responsibilities of Sheffield towards both proximate and distant
   strangers were highlighted. The paper argues that while the City of
   Sanctuary movement integrates both relational and territorial political
   practices, it also actively pursues a relational imaginary through
   presenting the city as a space of political connections and
   responsibilities. This is achieved through a twin focus upon the role
   asylum seekers and refugees play in constituting the city and the role
   that Sheffield might come to play in national discussions of asylum.
   Following this discussion, the paper looks to the implications of City
   of Sanctuary's work for a relational account of spatial politics,
   arguing that a dual orientation of spatial responsibilities `within'
   and `beyond' place may be more easily articulated in reference to some
   networks and flows than others. The experiences of City of Sanctuary
   therefore suggest that relational accounts must present a space of
   negotiation between territorial practices, political networks, spatial
   responsibilities and geographical imaginations. The development of City
   of Sanctuary into a national network of towns and cities promoting
   hospitality indicates the importance of such negotiations for
   developing a culture of refuge across British cities.}},

Abstract = {{Pointing movements made to a target defined by the imaginary
   intersection of a pointer with a distant landing line were examined in
   healthy human observers in order to determine whether such motor
   responses are susceptible to the Poggendorff effect. In this well-known
   geometric illusion observers make systematic extrapolation errors when
   the pointer abuts a second line (the inducer). The kinematics of
   extrapolation movements, in which no explicit target was present, where
   similar to those made in response to a rapid-onset (explicit) dot
   target. The results unambiguously demonstrate that motor (pointing)
   responses are susceptible to the illusion. In fact, raw motor biases
   were greater than for perceptual responses: in the absence of an
   inducer (and hence also the acute angle of the Poggendorff stimulus)
   perceptual responses were near-veridical, whilst motor responses
   retained a bias. Therefore, the full Poggendorff stimulus contained two
   biases: one mediated by the acute angle formed between the oblique
   pointer and the inducing line (the classic Poggendorff effect), which
   affected both motor and perceptual responses equally, and another bias,
   which was independent of the inducer and primarily affected motor
   responses. We conjecture that this additional motor bias is associated
   with an undershoot in the unknown direction of movement and provide
   evidence to justify this claim. In conclusion, both manual pointing and
   perceptual judgements are susceptible to the well-known Poggendorff
   effect, supporting the notion of a unitary representation of space for
   action and perception or else an early locus for the effect, prior to
   the divergence of processing streams. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Cyber is understood as computer and mathematical analysis of the flow
   of information. The word `Cyber' comes from the Greek word for
   navigator originating-in. kybernete meaning `helmsman'. Cyberspace is
   the virtual (nonphysical) space created by computer systems that is, a
   shared virtual or metaphorical environment whose inhabitants, objects,
   and spaces comprise data that is visualized, heard and touched by
   surfing Internet. In other words, it is an artificial, virtual,
   conceptually constructed mental environment or notional space developed
   using computers. This very idyllic conception of imaginary locale which
   is not a land of utopia but a realm of experience was crafted by a
   futuristic designer author William Gibson who coined the term
   cyberspace in his `Burning Chrome' in 1982 and later popularized by his
   sci-fi Hugo Award winning novel Neuromancer in 1984. The credit of
   Gibson had been acknowledged by John Perry Barlow in his works, `Crime
   and Puzzlement' published in 1990. He writes, `In this silent world,
   all conversation is typed. To enter it, one forsakes both body and
   place and becomes a thing of words alone. You can see what your
   neighbours are saying (or recently said), but not what either they or
   their physical surroundings look like. Town meetings are continuous and
   discussions rage on everything from sexual kinks to depreciation
   schedules. Whether by one telephonic tendril or millions, they are all
   connected to one another. Collectively, they form what their
   inhabitants call the `Net'. It extends across that immense region of
   electron states, microwaves, magnetic fields, light pulses and thought
   which sci-fi writer William Gibson named Cyberspace.' The problem is
   how to reconcile all the conflicting claims arising out of the issues
   of privacy in the context of Internet exposure vis-a-vis the fight to
   freedom of speech. The paper will raise all these issues cropping up in
   a number of fields and discuss the legal implications on the
   encroachment of the freedom of speech.}},

Abstract = {{In the dystopian worlds of 1984 and Brave New World, literature is the
   product of state power and it is used by the regime to obviate
   constructive criticism and the freedom of speech. Contrary to this
   model, more sophisticated methods are at work in today's modem society,
   and the most visible is the hegemony of television, which brought the
   need for the novel and literature almost to an end.
   The most important economic principle of profit forced the cultural
   industry to devote itself to an effective and witty communication with
   the public. Therefore, media content and popular culture have been
   reduced to an easily digestible symbolic material. The outcome is a
   culture in which visual display is more important than linguistic
   discourse. Advertising has a crucial role in the transition towards a
   new visual culture, that is, the transition from the discursive book
   culture to the figurative media culture. Advertising is recognised as a
   type of message and as a visually and acoustically altered language
   sign. Similar to a literary work, the fantastic world of advertising
   contains real and fictitious characters, dramatic situations and plots
   situated in an imaginary place and time. Such fantasies may be more
   compelling, exciting and dramatic than mundane life.
   Reading and encouraging people to read books, newspapers and magazines
   accompanied by their limited media and advertising exposure enhances
   the capacities of imagination and critical thinking keeping us at a
   safe distance from Huxley's and Orwell's dystopian visions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper sheds light on the psychological underpinnings of the
   enduring popularity of Vertigo location tours, and, more generally, on
   what people may be hoping to find or experience by visiting the literal
   remains of filmed fantasies. Those who desire to return to the places
   where Vertigo was filmed, it is argued, replicate the actions of its
   hero in the second half of the film. Scottie embarks on a futile quest
   to restore an unreal woman, an empty facade, an illusion created by
   Gavin Elster, trying to make a fictional image ``real.{''} Madeleine
   resembles what is described by Christian Metz as an ``imaginary
   signifier{''} that is infinitely desirable but never possessible.
   Vertigo's convoluted plot plays out and replays a perverse scenario
   that brilliantly depicts the experience of melancholia, as theorized by
   Giorgio Agamben as a state in which ``the libido stages a simulation
   where what cannot be lost because it has never been possessed appears
   as lost{''} (1979, 20). Scottie's behavior is likened to that Of a
   child who has suffered an insecure attachment to a ``dead{''}
   (depressed and therefore inattentive) mother and, as a result, never
   develops the capacity to love truly or mourn successfully. By leaving
   the viewer in a painful state of unresolved, suspense about Scottie's
   fate at the end of the film, Hitchcock reveals his inability to resolve
   his own issues around fear of loss and aggression toward desirable
   women. Those who seek out the locations of Vertigo continue Scottie's
   doomed quest to make a fantasy real, to diminish the gap between
   representation and reality, and thereby cling to an illusory means by
   which to overcome loss.}},

Abstract = {{This article argues that a new landscape of urbanization takes shape in
   Canadian cities. In-between the old downtowns and the new suburbs of
   urban Canada, a hitherto underexposed and under-researched mix of
   residential, commercial, industrial, educational, agricultural and
   ecologically protected areas and land uses has become the home and
   workplace, and increasingly also the playspace of most people in
   Canada. The article examines this new landscape through the lens of the
   specific risks and vulnerabilities experienced by its inhabitants and
   users. Using a propane gas explosion in Toronto in the summer of 2008
   as an example, we demonstrate that the `in-between city' is a space of
   great complexity, which has grown haphazardly and in a contradictory
   fashion, where, in contrast to the archetype of inner city and suburb,
   no clear spatial imaginary has been guiding urban development. This
   leads to always uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous proximities
   between various and competing uses and social practices. This is
   nowhere as clear as it is in the splintered urban infrastructures that
   service this landscape or use the in-between city's space to service
   other adjacent or distant purposes.Cet article fait valoir qu'un
   nouveau paysage de l'urbanisation prend forme presentement dans les
   villes canadiennes. Qu'elles soient de type residentiel, commercial,
   industriel, agricole, educationnel ou reserve ecologique, les
   differentes aires d'affectation du sol situees entre les anciens
   quartiers centraux et les nouvelles banlieues dans les agglomerations
   urbaines du Canada n'ont pas encore fait l'objet de recherches
   poussees. Pour la majorite de Canadiens, ces aires constituent des
   lieux de vie et de travail et, de plus en plus, des espaces de loisirs.
   Dans cet article, ce nouveau paysage est etudie en fonction des risques
   et vulnerabilites particuliers que vivent les habitants et utilisateurs
   de ces lieux. Une explosion de gaz propane survenue Toronto au cours de
   l'ete 2008 sert d'exemple pour demontrer quel point la `ville
   mitoyenne' constitue un espace d'une grande complexite qui s'urbanise
   de facon desordonnee et contradictoire et qui, ne correspondant pas aux
   modeles de la ville-centre et de la banlieue, est amenage selon un plan

   traduit toujours par des situations de proximite genantes et parfois
   dangereuses entre les occupations du sol et les pratiques sociales
   differentes et rivales. Il s'agit l d'un exemple flagrant dans lequel
   un systeme d'infrastructures urbaines fragmentees est destine desservir

   of pantomimes (e.g., peeling an imaginary banana) and action verbs in
   American Sign Language (ASL) that were rated as meaningless by
   non-signers (e.g., TO-DANCE). In contrast to visual fixation,
   pantomimes strongly activated fronto-parietal regions (the mirror
   neuron system, MNS) in hearing non-signers, but only bilateral middle
   temporal regions in deaf signers. When contrasted with ASL verbs,
   pantomimes selectively engaged inferior and superior parietal regions
   in hearing non-signers, but right superior temporal cortex in deaf
   signers. The perception of ASL verbs recruited similar regions as
   pantomimes for deaf signers, with some evidence of greater involvement
   of left inferior frontal gyrus for ASL verbs. Functional connectivity
   analyses with left hemisphere seed voxels (ventral premotor, inferior
   parietal lobule, fusiform gyrus) revealed robust connectivity with the
   MNS for the hearing non-signers. Deaf signers exhibited functional
   connectivity with the right hemisphere that was plot observed for the
   hearing group for the fusiform gyrus seed voxel. We suggest that
   life-long experience with manual communication, and/or auditory
   deprivation, may alter regional connectivity and brain activation when
   viewing pantomimes. We conclude that the lack of activation within the
   MNS for deaf signers does not support an account of human communication
   that depends upon automatic sensorimotor resonance between perception
   and action. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved,}},

   signs. Seeming ubiquitous address by unseen but always possible agents
   of the law riveted the spy to the body of undergrounder. Bound to a
   spiraling play of reveal-and-conceal, the undergrounder's presence also
   summoned an ``abduced{''} imaginary called ``the underground.{''} Here
   suspicion was general; forms were questioned, disarticulated, assigned
   provisional indexicalities. Every sign could suggest an observer, a
   secret code, a warning to hide. The paranoid undergrounder thus was
   discursively incarcerated and panoptically triangulated as a modern
   subject. The underground ironically splintered the Mormon resistance,
   and realized the Supreme Court's decree that, in short, the citizen's
   body be severed from the colonized subject's imagination.

   Christianity predominates within the public imaginary. The public
   identity of Kinshasa's television stars, audience reactions to artists'

Abstract = {{The rebels' justification discourse was built based on a triad: respect
   of monarchical dominion, defense of religion., and hatred of Gachupines
   / defense of the fatherland. The latter element distinguished the
   rebellion, since the royalists could not turn to it. Moreover, it was a
   concrete feeling that turned a specific group into the scapegoat for
   every misfortune in the world, as Furet would say. In this way, a
   convenient enemy was created, an enemy to blame, to fight, and who
   allowed the construction of an effective defensive ideology that would
   lay the foundations for the incipient Mexican nationalism, as Brading
   indicated. Thus, rebel violence not only found its object of hostility
   par excellence, but also its Justification: while an antigachupin
   imaginary was being built, expressed in edicts, proclamations and
   manifests, a violence materialized in murder, ransacking, and
   destruction appeared here and there. The insurgent antigachupinismo
   revealed very interesting aspects of a social and cultural history of
   the war of Independence - a kind of small scale French terror deployed
   at times by the insurgency, or the relationship between rumors and

Abstract = {{When immigrants arrive in the United States, their search for a new
   home represents a transformative personal and cultural journey. This
   paper investigates this transformative process in relation to Smart
   Growth principles around walkability promoted by a suburban county in
   the Washington, DC metropolitan area. This survey of immigrants from
   various countries in Asia and Latin America, finds that seventy percent
   of those who emigrated from urban environments prefer to live in
   single-family detached houses. Survey participants from Latin American
   countries prefer these homes in compact urban locations more than Asian
   immigrants and native-born Americans, while Asians prefer suburban
   neighborhoods with pedestrian amenities. Their preferences represent a
   hybrid version of the American dream which combines both the urban and
   suburban imaginary, or what this article terms `sub-urban{''}
   preferences. This study emphasizes that walkability is critical to
   immigrant sub-urban preferences and ought to influence the way
   professionals design and plan neighborhoods and housing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper will discuss the kinds of communities that evolve through
   historical practices of migration. The migrant house is associated with
   a new architecture that hod appeared in the cities of immigration of
   the new worlds (Melbourne, Toronto, Chicago). It is perceived as a
   stereotypical symbolisation of immigrants from Southern European
   origins that hod arrived in the decodes following the Second World War.
   The appearance of houses built by returning migrants in sites of origin
   suggests other trajectories, other modes of travel, and other forms of
   community. Central to the thesis of this paper is the testimony of two
   types of migrant houses. The study draws on theories of migration that
   address the site of departure, the site of arrival, and the question
   and conflict of return which is at the centre of the migrant imaginary.
   This study will examine the migrant houses in the village of emigration
   (Zavoj in Macedonia), migrant houses built by returning emigrants. A
   study of the two houses of migration implicates a set of networks,
   forces, relations, circumscribing a large global geopolitical and
   cultural field that questions our understandings of diaspora, the
   binary structure of dwelling/travelling, and the fabric and fabrication
   of community. In addition, the paper will explore the notion of house
   as an imaginary landscape, a psychic geography narrated through
   migratory travels.}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{77-90}},
Abstract = {{According to some experts marketing activities in Czech firms are no so
   widely and commonly used as in comparable markets. The aim of this
   paper is therefore to reveal the role of marketing in companies and to
   identify tools mostly used for supporting their marketing activities.
   This article is the output of the so called ``specific research{''}
   conducted at the University of West Bohemia in Pilsen, which was
   focused on firms from the Pilsen and Karlovy Vary region and should
   serve as a study for other projects and surveys. There participated 29
   firms in this research.
   Following hypotheses were formulated before canvassing:
   1. Marketing management is rather an intuitive then a systematic
   process.
   2. Worldwide customer orientation is exerted in Czech firms too.
   3. Product quality is perceived as the biggest competitive advantage.
   Whereas the first one has not been unambiguously approved nor disproved
   - although some firms carry out their marketing activities intuitively
   (the majority of them does not), many of them are not able to identify
   their own weaknesses, a lot of them do not perform any situational
   analysis. More than thirty per cent of the surveyed firms use no
   information system for supporting their marketing activities.
   On the other hand, Czech firms do not miss out the role of customers
   and their needs. It is a priority within the situational analysis for
   more than eighty-five per cent of companies. Furthermore, changes in
   the customers' preferences or their behaviour are pursued and evaluated
   mostly regularly.
   The third hypothesis has been approved too as the quality of products
   and services mentioned by more than third of all respondents leads the
   imaginary chart. Nevertheless, not only quality of product belongs to
   key factors while the quality of related services is very important as
   well. On the contrary, the former trend of focusing on price retreats.}},

Abstract = {{Stencil graffiti is an illegal, multi-vocal, visual urban discourse
   that alters the texture of street experience through inventive
   juxtaposition of mass-mediated and local imagery. Like street artists
   and neighborhood assemblies working in a variety of genres,
   stencil-makers compose public evidence of powerful trans-boundary
   imaginaries that are at the same time part of a uniquely Argentinean
   cultural formation. This analysis is based on over 300 digital
   photographic examples collected by the author in 2007 post-crisis
   Argentina, where the flourishing of artistic dissent is shaped by
   vibrant immigrant traditions, widespread poverty, and the recent
   political history of military dictatorship followed by an economic
   collapse that radicalized youth and the middle class. Building on
   Gell's argument that art objects, and the places that form part of
   their causal milieu, share social agency with the artists that produce
   them, this article shows how stencils confront institutional power by
   expanding the semiotic range of two aquatic spaces: a neighborhood
   fountain in Buenos Aires and a national river front monument in
   Rosario. The focus is on developing an approach towards understanding
   the active role of public waterscapes in the cultural and political
   performance of collective memory and social change.}},

Abstract = {{Contextual information provides an important source for behavioral

   collinearly to form an imaginary square. The presence of such a square
   eliminated the contextual-cuing effect, despite the fact that the
   square's location still had a predictive value for the target location.
   Three follow-up experiments demonstrated that other types of grouping
   abolished contextual cuing in a similar way and that the mere presence
   of a task-irrelevant singleton had only a diminishing effect (by half)
   on contextual cuing. These findings suggest that a segmented, salient
   region can interfere with contextual cuing, reducing its predictive

Abstract = {{Different forms of deception are closely connected with the profile of
   their perpetrators. They usually they try to disguise, in one or other
   way, their involvement in criminal activities, in particular in front
   of victims of criminal offences or agencies of formal and informal
   social control. Furthermore, violators of criminal law norms very often
   try to conceal their ``criminality{''} even from themselves, resorting
   to various techniques of rationalization or ``neutralization{''} of
   unlawful or immoral behaviour and thus keeping their positive
   self-image and self-respect. On the other hand, they also cheat the
   criminal justice system by giving the impression that they oppose the
   most serious cases of socially harmful or dangerous phenomena and their
   commission or omission. However, this is not all. Various deceptions
   and self-deceptions seem to be - to a greater or lesser extent - a
   constitutive element and probably also an unavoidable dimension of our
   individual lives and collective practices, i.e., of the perpetual
   reproduction of social ``order{''}. It is not therefore surprising that
   we pretend that we can hardly imagine how the world capitalist system
   would function without continuous ``cheating{''}, for example without a
   belief in the general good of economic ``growth{''} (and competitive
   conflict on markets), without ever-present economic propaganda (i.e.,
   publicity and advertising), without the objective illusion of the
   freedom of the sellers of labour and buyers of commercial goods,
   without promises of this world ``deliverance{''} (i.e.,
   self-realisation or undisturbed perfect pleasure) by consumer practices
   (in particular practices connected with one's social status or objects
   of imaginary constructs)... Last but not least, we are asking ourselves
   whether a deep, distasteful feeling of being cheated is not precisely
   one of the most important elements of (post) transitional or
   post-socialist ``awareness{''}, connected with the widespread opinion
   that ``we have been shamelessly fooled by the former and the new

Abstract = {{This paper draws on research with people from African, Caribbean and
   Asian backgrounds regarding perceptions and use of the English
   countryside. I explore the complex ways in which the category `rural'
   was constructed as both essentialised and relational: how the
   countryside was understood most definitely as `not-city' but also, at
   the same time, the English countryside was conceived as part of a range
   of networks: one site in a web of nature places' across the country, as
   well as one rural in an international chain of rurals - specifically
   via embodied and emotional connections with `nature'. I argue that
   alongside sensed/sensual embodiment (the non-representational intuitive
   work of the body), we need also to consider reflective embodiment as a
   desire to space/place in order to address the structural socio-spatial
   exclusions endemic in (rural) England and how they are challenged. I
   suggest that a more progressive conceptualisation of rurality - a
   `transrural' open to issues of mobility and desire - can help us
   disrupt dominant notions of rural England as only an exclusionary white
   space, and reposition it as a site within multicultural, multiethnic,

Abstract = {{This study offers a multilevel analysis of the form of the third
   movement of Mahler's Second Symphony providing three frameworks (those
   of a sophisticated trio form, a bipartite idiosyncratic form, and all
   imaginary, `endless' form). Conceiving of the formal dimensions of the
   Scherzo of Mahler's Second Symphony as ontological models, I will
   contextualize these with reference to the writings of E.T.A. Hoffmann,
   Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche. Among the new discoveries of this
   investigation, I will outline the implications of three hitherto
   neglected circumstances: first, the movement's first extended unit
   itself constitutes a self-contained symphonic scherzo movement; next,
   the movement can be described as two succeeding permutations of the
   same set of thematic materials; finally, there is a crucial recurrence
   suggesting the infinitude of the form. Instead of creating an
   ill-conceived dichotomy between form as a secondary structure and the
   meaningful `narrative' ill negotiation with formal questions, I wish to
   regard form as a primary source of a works meaning. At the same time, I
   wish to regard the form of the movement as an efficient means of
   channelling its dialogue with the genre of scherzo. Listened to as a
   composers self-positioning in the field of the masters of symphony, the
   movement reveals Mahler's Successful attempt at breaking away from the
   Brucknerian model of scherzo and, at the same time, proudly parading
   his Virtuosity ill applying some elements of that model in a different

Abstract = {{This article examines the racialization of informational labor in

   World of Azeroth. This profiling activity is part of a larger biometric
   turn initiated by digital culture's informationalization of the body
   and illustrates the problematics of informationalized capitalism. If
   late capitalism is characterized by the requirement for subjects to be
   possessive individuals, to make claims to citizenship based on

   that they are unable to obtain avatarial self-possession. The painful
   paradox of this dynamic lies in the ways that it mirrors the

Abstract = {{The philosophical presupposition underlying this article is that
   theoretical ``models{''} for self-understanding will only succeed if
   subjectivity is approached as a complex phenomenon defined in terms of
   necessary internal conflict. Lacan's articulation of three subjective
   registers (Real, Imaginary, and Symbolic) as a ``Borromean knot{''}
   offers the basis for developing a model for self-understanding that
   does justice to this kind of complexity in human subjectivity. One may
   add to this that specific concerns and passions characterize each
   register. The ontological/existential concern of the Real engenders
   ``ontophilia,{''} the self-concern of the Imaginary ``autophilia{''},
   and the concern for humanity in the Symbolic ``anthrophilia{''}. This
   articulation of registers and passions is further complexified by
   internal divisions between ``paranoiac{''}, ``hysterical{''}, and
   ``paradoxical{''} styles of the passions. I aim to outline an
   adequately complex Lacanian model for self-understanding as an
   articulation of registers, passions, and styles. In an effort to make
   this accessible beyond the confines of Lacanian scholarship, it has
   been applied to well-known historical and contemporary figures.}},

Abstract = {{Part of Chris Searle's wide-ranging contribution to Race \& Class - and
   the subject of this article - is a body of cricket writing that exposes
   the crippling imperial legacies of the game but still insists on its
   potential for the future, particularly in England; a future Searle
   understands as emerging from the country's working-class, multi-ethnic,
   inner-city communities. Searle is indebted to C. L. R. James's Beyond a
   Boundary (1963) and, like James, sees cricket as a site for the
   expression, playing out and (sometimes) the imaginary resolution of
   social relations. Searle also follows James in arguing that, because of
   the game's sociality, the politics of cricketing performance must be
   assessed in terms of the relationship between players and their
   communities. In this context, he has analysed the significance of
   figures like Devon Malcolm, England's Jamaican-born fast bowler, and
   Brian Lara, the world-record holding West Indies batsman. Notably,
   Searle's academic and personal contribution has been `Towards a cricket
   of the future', as one of his own pieces is entitled. He has also
   helped lay the ground for a critique of the globalised televisual
   spectacle that is, increasingly, the international game of cricket.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this article is to show that, in order to understand the new

   current resurrection of religion in the public sphere is linked to a
   deep transformation of political imagination which has its roots in the
   double process of the reduction of politics to mere administration, on
   the one hand, and to spectacle, on the other. In an epoch when politics
   is said to be simply a question of `good governance', of good
   administration within a neo-liberal consensus, the paradox is that of a
   lack of political imagination which goes hand in hand with its
   hypertrophy through the media. This article tackles this paradox, by
   firstly discussing the nexus of politics, imagination and religion and,
   secondly, by analysing their contemporary transformations. In
   conclusion, the thesis is illustrated through the analysis of some
   contemporary examples.}},

Abstract = {{Although bomba remains a largely understudied musical genre, the
   majority of studies on bomba have focused on the historicizing or
   anthropological detailing of bomba as an Afro-Puerto Rican musical
   tradition. Recognizing the importance of these initial studies, this
   article critically interrogates the gendered dimensions of bomba
   dancing as well as the historical and structural implications imbued
   within colonial and racialized contexts. In short, the gendered
   division of cultural labor in bomba has received notable recognition,
   whereas bomba as a racialized and ogendered experience/expressiono has
   not been sufficiently explored. The performers mentioned in this study
   include two youth bands as well as audience members from the San Juan
   metropolitan area (between the ages of 18 and 30) who participated in
   an ethnographic study during the summer of 2002. Based on this
   fieldwork and data, this presentation uses the historically osituated
   imaginarieso of these youth performers as means to understand the ways
   in which bomba is used and experienced differently by female and male
   practitioners (Stoetzler and Yuval-Davis 2002). This article maintains
   that (1) the relationship between dance partners remains marginal in
   meaning infused contexts of bomba and that (2) bomba as experienced by
   the performers in this study provides a useful research lens for
   reexamining both popular and colonial representations of gender
   performance within the public and private spheres in Puerto Rico.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the strategies of two satellite operators working

   post-communist territories to circulate broadcast and telecommunication
   signals, facilitate flows of capital and reshape geographic

Abstract = {{This multidisciplinary article compares the pattern of memory loss
   described in Gabriel Garca Mrquezs One Hundred Years of Solitude to
   that exhibited by patients with semantic dementia (SD). In his renowned
   novel, Garca Mrquez depicts the plight of Macondo, a town struck by the
   dreaded insomnia plague. The most devastating symptom of the plague is
   not the impossibility of sleep, but rather the loss of the name and
   notion of things. In an effort to combat this insidious loss of
   knowledge, the protagonist, Jos Arcadio Buenda, marked everything with
   its name: table, chair, clock, door, wall, bed, pan. Studying the
   infinite possibilities of a loss of memory, he realized that the day
   might come when things would be recognized by their inscriptions but
   that no one would remember their use. The cognitive impairments
   experienced by Macondos inhabitants are remarkably similar to those
   observed in SD, a clinical syndrome characterized by a progressive
   breakdown of conceptual knowledge (semantic memory) in the context of
   relatively preserved day-to-day (episodic) memory. First recognized in
   1975, it is now considered one of the main variants of frontotemporal
   lobar degeneration. Writing within the realm of magical realism and
   investigating the power of language as a form of communication, Garca
   Mrquez provides beautiful descriptions of the loss of the name and
   notion of things typical of the syndrome. He further speculates on ways
   to cope with this dissolution of meaning, ranging from the spell of an
   imaginary reality to Jos Arcadios memory machine, strategies that
   resonate with attempts by semantic dementia patients to cope with their
   disease. Remarkably, Garca Mrquez created a striking literary depiction
   of collective semantic dementia before the syndrome was recognized in
   neurology. The novel also provides an inspiring and human account of
   one towns fight against the quicksand of forgetfulness.}},

Abstract = {{The recent emphasis on the link between development and diasporic
   activities does not only reflect social changes, like the increase in

   for the political and social inclusion of migrants in their country of

   social unit that predated the new discourse on transcontinental labour
   migration but rather emerged in its course. Institutional slots were
   created for Ghanaian migrant associations and individuals in the
   receiving countries to act as representatives of the Ghanaian
   ``diaspora{''}. In this framework transnational development rituals
   have become an important means for legitimising migrant organisations
   and their claims to political participation in their country of origin.
   The postcolonial imaginary of development and its icons, in particular
   hospitals, schools and public infrastructure, provide a symbolical
   background against which migrants and state representatives
   re-negotiate questions of social status, citizenship and identity The
   symbolical power of the discourse of development and diaspora helps to

   those in which she purposely steps outside the narrative. The two

   the two sides of a debate or the voices of contrasting experiences;
   they are also two voices of time that, depending oil the context, are
   either internal or externally projected. The shadow of time, in which
   past and present often overlap each other, underlies Krsna Sobti's

Abstract = {{In late eighteenth-century Spanish discourse, moralists and satirists
   attempted to redress what they deemed a grave social issue: the loss of
   a masculine, virtuous visibility in men, especially in young,
   well-heeled males. In moralist essays, the petimetre became the
   quintessential trope for the idle, effeminate, aristocratic Spanish
   man. He was created as a literary figure to stand in marked contrast to
   the manly hombre de bien, who represented martial valor and
   heteronormative privacy. Juan Antonio Mcrcadal, author of El Duende
   especulativo sobre la vida civil (1761), delved into the issue with,
   among other writings, his ``Discurso IX.{''} In this essay, he
   describes a type of man whom he refers to as ``hermaphrodita.{''} Like
   the petimetre, this is a queer male figure who transgresses the
   dimorphous gendered system. By using the term hermaphrodite, Mercadal
   conjures up images of an intersex person who retained a monstrous,
   almost mythical reputation during the eighteenth century. In effect,
   the satirist is employing a coded word to invent a new reality: an
   intergendered male who challenges what it means to be a man or a woman.
   The unintended result of Mercadal's essay is the creation of a new
   identity that brings together ser and aparecer, or reality and
   illusion. By creating the figure of the hermaphrodita, Mercadal
   engendered the very reality he wished to combat.}},

   library in nineteen scientific documents ( articles and works presented
   at scientific events), and also the different meanings of this
   information unit, its objectives and its ways of constituting the

Abstract = {{Curricular questions of what and how knowledge should matter take on
   particular urgency when the knowledge at stake refers to cultural
   devastation in history. Whereas narratives of progress and discourses
   of ``protecting the child{''} continue to dominate the public
   imaginary, a number of curriculum theorists have begun to explore the
   multiple ways in which educators have and continue to represent such
   histories in the classroom. This emergent literature offers a theory of
   pedagogy not as a set of skills to apply, but a way of asking questions
   about the ethical obligations, ontological crises and anxieties at work
   in efforts to teach and learn from difficult histories. My article
   elaborates on the problem of uncertainty from the vantage of two
   psychoanalytic thinkers who are also interested in the work of
   introducing the child to a world that fails: D.W. Winnicott's
   discussions with mothers on the problem of ``disillusionment{''} and
   Jonathan Lear's discussion of ``radical hope.{''} In bringing together
   these examples, I offer a theory of education that articulates what is
   hopeful about the capacity to tolerate the disillusionment of both
   learning from and living in difficult times. At stake is a model of
   history education that can survive the disillusion of the promise of
   certainty and still dream of tomorrow.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the ways in which researcher authenticity is
   negotiated along three axes of difference, ethno-linguistic
   affiliation, sexual orientation and race/skin color. Ultimately, it
   analyzes how researcher authenticity is produced and played out within
   research, via interactions between participants, researchers and others
   who influence the research project, especially when researchers and
   research are transnational. Yoshino's Covering, a new addition to
   critical legal studies, provides a theoretical framework for analysis.
   Namely, what society comes to imagine as `normal' and `mainstream' are
   myths that limit us by forcing us to play-up favored traits and
   downplay disfavored ones. In order to be considered authentic,
   researchers often are pressed into playing roles - fitting norms -
   produced by narratives that limit and give way to how the researcher
   can be imagined. The analysis suggests that researcher authenticity,
   however, is not completely fixed, but discursively shaped during
   research. The ambivalence inherent in inscribing imaginary subjects
   that are inadequate and unattainable unfixes the subject and provides a
   gap where the possibility for producing new narratives exists. This
   work has implications for the narrow view of science that quickly is
   becoming the norm in this era of research.}},

Pages = {{561-567}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, I deploy an analytic of `translocal assemblage' as a
   means for conceptualising space and power in social movements. I offer
   a relational topology that is open to how actors within movements
   construct different spatial imaginaries and practices in their work. In
   using the prefix `translocal', I am signifying three orientations.
   First, translocal assemblages are composites of place-based social
   movements which exchange ideas, knowledge, practices, materials and
   resources across sites. Second, assemblage is an attempt to emphasise
   that translocal social movements are more than just the connections
   between sites. Sites in translocal assemblages have more depth than the
   notion of `node' or `point' suggests - as connoted by network - in
   terms of their histories, the labour required to produce them, and
   their inevitable capacity to exceed the connections between other
   groups or places in the movement. Third, they are not simply a spatial
   category, output, or resultant formation, but signify doing,
   performance and events. I examine the potential of assemblage to offer
   an alternative account to that of the `network', the predominant and
   often de facto concept used in discussions of the spatiality of social
   movements. I draw on examples from one particular translocal assemblage
   based in and beyond Mumbai which campaigns on housing within informal

Abstract = {{This article considers the manner in which city life informs some of

   interrogates tropes of the urban in three of Hall's most well known

   Policing the Crisis, the original `New Ethnicities' essay and a more
   recent intervention that considers the nature of the multicultural. The
   spaces of the city in these works act as both the horizon of the
   political imaginary and the stage of political action in Hall's work.
   The article argues that a sense of urbanism is transformed from being
   the empirical realization of theoretical determinations of identity to
   becoming a constitutive feature in an understanding of the

   championed by Isocrates and Cicero against Platonic essentialist
   philosophy, is for Gadamer the counter-tradition to Western
   essentialism as a whole, anchored squarely in Plato's dialogic example.
   In this reading, Plato becomes strange to all ersatz platonists, and
   the great body of the dialogues become the gravitational center of a

   dialegesthai as the highest fruit of ancient rhetoric provides a fresh
   opportunity to reimagine our interdisciplinary debates.}},

Journal = {{POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{174-185}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The analysis of neoliberalism has become a key point of departure in
   critical urban studies and political geography. Its application in
   theorising new forms of residential environments is no exception.
   Common interest developments, gated communities and, in the Australian
   case, masterplanned residential estates (MPREs) are cast as vehicles of
   neoliberalist privatisation, extending private property rights and
   embedding market logics and neoliberal modes of privatised governance.
   This paper is a critical theoretical and empirical engagement with the
   interpretation of these residential developments as iconic expressions
   of urban neoliberalisation. We bring poststructuralist thinking on
   neoliberalism as an assemblage of diverse practices and projects
   together with poststructuralist conceptions of the public and private
   as contextual and enacted political constructions, to provide an
   alternative analytic-an analytic of assemblage-for investigating
   putative pathways of neoliberal privatisation. We suggest the purchase
   of this extended framework through an exploration of MPRE development
   by Sydney's largest MPRE developer. in this framework, MPREs become
   contingent productions in which multiple and overdetermined projects,
   practices and paradigms of governance are at work including, amongst
   others, social sustainability and interventionism. Rather than
   producing neoliberal privatisation, we explore how MPRE developments
   involve the complex constitution of new forms of public and private
   that exceed coding as neoliberal. We conclude that the framework
   engaged with here can enable productive advances for urban theorising.
   Its emphasis on practice, enactment, multiplicity and assemblage can
   resist a tendency to reify urban neoliberalism and nurture the
   development of new conceptions and discourses Of urban governance less
   bound to the neoliberal imaginary. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Sociolegal research has paid comparatively little attention to how

   communities from other cases involving private homeowner associations.
   By focusing on these boundary disputes in which outsiders are excluded
   from the area, this article finds that courts are resisting the
   localism presented by gated communities and are instead articulating a
   social imaginary in which the landscape flows uninterrupted by the
   exclusionary presence of gates. In contrast to the privatopia
   literature, this article finds that courts are not complicit in
   promoting neoliberal visions of community. The social imaginary being
   developed by courts resists the spatial differentiation of gated
   communities, producing in its place a thoroughly modern polity in which
   legal, economic, and political relations flow easily between those

   and reception of science and technology by non-scientific actors and
   institutions. One consequence is that the relationship of science and
   technology to political power has tended to remain undertheorized. This
   article aims to fill that gap by introducing the concept of
   ``sociotechnical imaginaries.{''} Through a comparative examination of
   the development and regulation of nuclear power in the US and South
   Korea, the article demonstrates the analytic potential of the
   imaginaries concept. Although nuclear power and nationhood have long
   been imagined together in both countries, the nature of those
   imaginations has remained strikingly different. In the US, the state's
   central move was to present itself as a responsible regulator of a
   potentially runaway technology that demands effective
   ``containment.{''} In South Korea, the dominant imaginary was of
   ``atoms for development{''} which the state not only imported but
   incorporated into its scientific, technological and political
   practices. In turn, these disparate imaginaries have underwritten very
   different responses to a variety of nuclear shocks and challenges, such
   as Three Mile Island (TMI), Chernobyl, and the spread of the
   anti-nuclear movement.}},

Abstract = {{The bulk of Leonard Bernstein's first book, The Joy of Music (1959),

Pages = {{215-227}},
Abstract = {{This article is a preliminary proposal of how to redefine basic
   narratological notions in reference to issues and analytical methods of
   cognitive narratology. In light of the latter, literary narrative
   constitutes an experiment in accepting and representing someone else's
   perspective (cognitive, emotional, perceptual). This fact has to do
   with the properties of one of the basic forms of human consciousness -
   namely, the functioning of intersubjectivity as a permanent orientation
   of consciousness toward presence of other people being perceived as
   intentional and mental subjects. The possibility of taking into
   consideration another person's perspective is one of the most important
   features of human cognition, one being of great importance to
   cooperation and communication. The author's original creation of a
   character and the reader's mental representation of the latter can be
   considered to be an act of imaginary simulation of somebody else's
   perspective. Making use of the cognitive model of intersubjectivity in
   the theory of narrative enables a new interpretation of phenomena
   related to literary communication, literary character, and reception of
   literature. It also allows for extending the issues of consciousness in
   literature beyond the limits of conventions of presenting the
   character's internal speech.}},

Abstract = {{This paper begins by analyzing the concept and term cons and connecting
   it with the typical Soviet practice of shortening words (loks, veshch,
   which was also adopted by some European avantgardists (merz, mont).
   Kosovel used the original word cons to denote his own contribution to
   European constructivism; it denotes a ``thing{''} (veshch in transition
   from composition to construction, or from a poem to cons.
   Among other things, the Tatlin-Kosovel relationship can also be
   discerned from the manifesto Mehanikom (To the Mechanics), in which
   Kosovel reacts to the polemic regarding Tatlin's ``machine art{''} and,
   Eke Lisicki and Erenburg, tries to rehabilitate Tatlin and thus also
   his own constructivism. Kosovel thus talks about the ``human
   machine{''} and demands a poster campaign to destroy the ``human
   machine.{''} At this level, Kosovel also perceives the difference
   between Marinetti's ``mechanical human being{''} and Tatlin's
   ideologically manipulated ``human machine,{''} as understood by the
   Berlin Dadaists.
   El Lisicki had an impact on Kosovel through his ``mobile philosophy{''}
   and understanding of imaginary space. Conses are thus beyond
   contemplation, and urge movement, action, and a critical attitude
   towards the world. Following Lisicki's example, Kosovel introduced
   emptiness in his conses, which changes into a plano-convex and
   plano-concave space, into letters in space, where there is no more
   perspective and gravitation. In his spatially conceptualized conses,
   Kosovel made his poetry dynamic and kinetic in order to reach the
   reader again. The use of engineering sketches, geometric material, and
   spatial definitions of conses effectively combined the content and form
   into a new organic unit, as applied in the work of Lisicki, Tatlin, and
   Chicherin, and in Zelinski's constructivism. Letters grew into space;
   there was no more painting and poetry, but only architecture and
   constructiveness connected with ``discipline and organization of the
   spirit.{''}}},

Abstract = {{Faces scales are one of the most commonly used instruments to assess
   pain intensity in children. Most available faces scales present five to
   seven faces. The present research was conducted to investigate the
   ability of 4- to 7-year-old children to distinguish the response
   categories of different faces scales. in the first study, 121 children
   were asked to rate painful situations on a 3- and a 6-level faces scale
   commencing with a smiling `no pain' face. Children were divided into
   two age groups (4-5 and 6-7 years). Investigations of the category
   functioning were performed with a rating scale Rasch model for each age
   group. Results revealed the low performances of the 6-level faces scale
   as compared to the 3-level faces scale and also the difficulty children
   experienced in scoring the imaginary painfulness of items.
   Consequently, a second study was conducted. In this second study, 76
   children were asked to rate pictures depicting painful situations on a
   3-level faces scale beginning with a neutral `no pain' face. Results of
   this second study confirmed an improvement in the ability to
   distinguish the three response categories with age. The 4-5 year-old
   children could only distinguish two response categories and the 6-7
   year-old children were able to discern the three levels of the 3-level
   faces scale. in Conclusion, Young children do not distinguish as many
   faces as proposed by the majority of available faces scales. These
   results strongly recommend a reduction in the number of response levels
   of faces scales for pain assessment in children. (C) 2008 European

Abstract = {{In this essay, I examine several events involving Filipinos at home and
   abroad that organize themselves around convergences of mediation: sites
   and events where figures and practices of religious mediation interact
   with modern technologies of the mass media. Illustrating these at the
   center of the essay is an ethnography of a festival celebrating the
   Virgin Mary's birthday that was organized by a Filipino devotional
   group and took place in New York City. Framing this event in the essay
   is a seemingly unrelated incident: the kidnapping of an Overseas
   Filipino Worker (OFW) by a group demanding that the Philippine
   government withdraw its coalition forces from Iraq. One extraordinary
   coincidence and the appeal for divine intervention immediately links
   the two. What further draws these two events into relatedness, however,
   is that they both entail imaginaries of the global Philippines that are
   rooted in a shared history of transnational movement, but diverge owing
   to significant differences in socioeconomic status and physical
   vulnerability. For the religious imaginary wherein the Philippines is
   firmly and safely situated in a worldwide order of Marian redemption
   betokens the privilege to assume preemptive control over dangerous
   worlds via particular frameworks of interpretation. Using Filipino
   Marianism first as a lens through which to understand the range of
   affinities between religious and technological mediation, I then
   examine the ways in which such intermedial relationships reveal the
   associative paths that generate class-inflected interpretations of
   crisis and danger, as well as the strategies of power and control to
   which those paths give rise.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the different meanings of the monochromatic
   principle and the act of voiding in two productions of The Cherry
   Orchard - Georgia Strehler's renowned, predominantly white production
   (1974) and all Israeli production directed by Yevgeny Arye at the
   Gesher Theater in Tel Aviv (2006), in which a white canopy hung over
   the stage. In both cases, the perception of the space negates the
   independent reality of the place, shaping it rather as a potential
   space. The visual formation that realizes the principle of
   potentiality-in any production, in any variation - is used as a ground
   oil which mental and imaginary projections are cast. Characters acting
   in such a space are, to use Bloch's terms, in it state of `not yet' -
   expecting and hoping to realize their potential lives. fit addition,
   the stage space is constructed in both productions, albeit in different
   ways, as all intermediate space - a potential Space, in Winnicott's
   terms - that is fined up with transitional objects and games. Chekhov's
   characters exist in the gap between mergence with the object and
   separation of the subject, and thus also between past and future.
   Suspension of the reality principle and pseudo-liberation front its
   realization are a psychoanalytic version of utopia. Such an existence
   is utopian also by dint of being all ideological model based - contrary
   to our sociopolitical realities - oil subject-object unity, radically
   expressed by means of the dominant white monochrome.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines a sequence of investigations in parasitology,
   botany, pharmacology, psychometrics and ethnopsychology focused on
   Kenyan village children's knowledge of medicinal herbs. We follow this
   work of making and ordering of knowledge, showing that the different
   disciplinary perspectives on bodies, medicines, knowledges, children
   and cultures produced by this research all sought the foundation of
   knowledge in reference to objective reality, and that they aimed to
   make the world known in the specific form of distinct and comparable
   entities with individual properties and capacities. Based on subsequent
   ethnographic observations of healing in the same village, we outline a
   different, contrasting modality of knowing, which places ontology above
   epistemology. Medicinal knowledge and its transformational capacity are
   here not located within entities but between them; not in objective
   reality but in effects; `to know' means `to come together' with the
   implication of having an effect on one another. We use this
   ethnographic sketch of a different form of knowing as a foil against
   which to contrast the imaginary that had shaped our previous research.
   Beyond the stark contrast between herbal village healing and
   pharmacological laboratory analysis, we expand our argument by moving
   from natural science to social science, from studies of plants and
   substances to those of humans, minds and cultures; from laboratories to
   ethno-psychological tests, cultural models, and eventually
   econometrics. We suggest that by reiterating a particular scientific
   imaginary, remaking humans (and non-human beings) as known things, a
   specific notion of man and a related political economy of knowledge is
   naturalized. Looking back at our involvement with this sequence of
   research, we realize that, contrary to our intentions, our inclusion as
   ` social scientists' into a multidisciplinary scientific project may
   have exacerbated rather than mitigated its potentially problematic
   effects.}},

Title = {{Beyond Multiculturalism: Recognition Through the Relational Reason}},
Journal = {{POLISH SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW}},
Year = {{2009}},
Number = {{166}},
Pages = {{147-177}},
Abstract = {{Multiculturalism is a term spreading in the West during the 1960s to
   indicate respect, tolerance and defence of cultural minorities. The
   idea of multiculturalism has become a collective imaginary ({''}all
   different, all equals{''}). It has generated a political ideology
   supporting an inclusive citizenship towards ``different{''} cultures.
   After being adopted as official policy in many Countries,
   multiculturalism has generated more negative than positive effects
   (fragmenting the society, separating the minorities and fostering
   cultural relativism). As a political doctrine, it seems harder and
   harder to be put into practice. At its place, today we talk of
   interculturality. But this expression too seems quite vague and
   uncertain. This essay discusses on the possible alternatives to
   multiculturalism, asking itself whether the way of interculturality can
   be a solution or not. The Author's thesis is that the theory of
   interculturality has the advantage to stress the inter, namely what
   lies in between different cultures. But it does not possess yet the
   conceptual and effective means to understand and handle the problems of
   the public sphere, when the different Cultures express cultural values
   radically conflictual between them. The troubles of interculturality
   result from two lacks: an insufficient reflexivity inside the single
   cultures, and the lack of a relational interface between the different
   cultures (between the carrier subjects). Modern western Reason created
   a societal structure (lib-lab) promoting neither the first nor the
   second one. In fact, it neutralizes them, because it faces the dilemmas
   of values inside the cultural diversities through criteria of ethical
   indifference. Such criteria set reflexivity to zero, preventing
   individuals to understand the deepest reasons of the vital experience
   of the others. Reason is emptied of its meaning and of its
   understanding capability. To go over the failures of multiculturalism
   and the fragilities of interculturality, a lay approach to the
   coexistence of cultures is required, being able to give strength back
   to Reason, through new semantics of the inter-human diversity. The
   Author suggests the development of the ``relational reason,{''} beyond
   the forms already known of rationality. To make Reason relational might
   be the best way to imagine a new social order of society, being able to
   humanize the globalizing processes and the growing migrations. The
   after-modern society would be more or less human, depending on how it
   will be able to widen the human Reason, structuring it inside a new
   ``relational unit{''} with the religious faith.}},

Journal = {{HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF THE LIFE SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{30}},

Pages = {{431-456}},
Abstract = {{Despite a long history of debates about the heritability of human
   traits by researchers and other critical commentators, the possible
   heterogeneity of genetic and environmental factors that underlie
   patterns in observed traits has not been recognized as a significant
   conceptual and methodological issue. This article is structured to
   stimulate a wide range of readers to pursue diverse implications of
   underlying heterogeneity and of its absence from previous debates.
   Section 1, a condensed critique of previous conceptualizations and
   interpretations of heritability studies, consists of three core
   propositions centered on heterogeneity and six supplementary
   propositions. Reference is made to agricultural evaluation trials in
   which a number of different genetically replicable varieties are raised
   in multiple replicates in one or more locations. In such analyses, the
   best case for illuminating genetic and environmental factors can be
   achieved; analyses in human genetics, in contrast, fall far snort of
   the ideal. Section 2 identifies a wide range of questions that invite
   philosophical, historical, sociological, and scientific inquiry. These
   are organized under four headings: debase over the conceptual
   implications of heterogeneity; history of translation of methods from
   agriculture and laboratory breeding into human genetic analysis;
   racialized imaginaries in the analysis of differences among groups; and
   areas of scientific inquiry that may allow more attention to underlying

Abstract = {{Research suggests that averting gaze from an interlocutor can improve

   With the present experiments, we investigated the effect of gaze

   through an imaginary matrix, while either maintaining eye-contact with
   the experimenter, closing their eyes, gazing at a static or a dynamic
   visual stimulus (in Experiment 1), or fixating an upright or inverted
   image of the experimenter's face (in Experiment 2). The results show
   that whereas maintaining eye-contact with another person disrupts
   accurate imagination of this pathway, averting gaze or looking at other
   visual stimuli does not. We conclude that gaze aversion benefits
   cognitive performance, not just by disengaging visual attention from
   irrelevant visual information, but also by interrupting social
   interaction processes involved in face-to-face communication.}},

   dimension, and the liturgical symbol loses its deictic function: it
   does not point any longer to something beyong itself, but becomes
   self-sufficient and is considered first an foremost for its aesthetic
   qualities. The Eucharistic mysteries, in particular, become the central
   elements in a religion devoid of transcendence, and a source of poetic

Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{305-319}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Violence and authoritarianism continue to resonate in Cambodia's
   post-transitional landscape, leading many scholars, journalists,
   international donors and non-governmental organisations alike to posit
   a `culture of violence' as responsible for the country's democratic
   deficit and enduring violence. In contrast, this paper interprets the
   culture of violence thesis as a sweeping caricature shot through with
   Orientalist imaginaries, and a problematic discourse that underwrites
   the process of neoliberalisation. The culture of violence argument is
   considered to invoke particular imaginative geographies that
   problematically erase the contingency, fluidity and interconnectedness
   of the places in which violence occurs. While violence is certainly
   mediated through both culture and place, following Doreen Massey's
   re-conceptualisation of space and place, this paper understands place
   not as a confined and isolated unit, but as a relational constellation
   within the wider experiences of space. This reflection allows us to
   recognise that any seemingly local, direct or cultural expression of
   violence is necessarily imbricated in the wider, structural patterns of
   violence, which in the current moment of political economic orthodoxy
   increasingly suggests a relationship to neoliberalism. Through the
   adoption of the culture of violence discourse, neoliberalisation is
   argued to proceed in the Cambodian context as a `civilising'
   enterprise, where Cambodians are subsequently imagined as `savage
   others'.}},

Abstract = {{The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Programme (CARP) was introduced in
   the Philippines in 1988 to facilitate a more equitable distribution of
   land and heighten agrarian efficiencies. The programme has faced
   considerable obstacles on the island of Negros, where sugar barons have
   tried to manipulate the new land laws to retain ownership of their
   large estates. This paper outlines the response of peasant communities
   on Negros who, with national scale nongovernmental organizations, have
   coalesced a social movement in a vision of fair and equitable land
   reform. Building on recent work by social movement theorists, we focus
   upon the production of the collective identity that binds
   geographically isolated communities into a coherent and recognized
   grouping. Particular attention is given to the promulgation of
   oppositional histories and narratives through farmer association
   networks which provide peasants with the means to nurture alternative
   environmental imaginaries and inspire resistance actions. While the
   strengths of such identities in resisting more powerful development
   actors are evident, questions are raised about the longevity of such
   identities, their role post-land reform and their potential to
   contribute to more fundamental postdevelopment challenges to imposed
   development norms and processes.}},

Abstract = {{The average human vocabulary consists of approximately 20,000 word

   measurable intelligence and when choosing potential mates individuals
   actively prefer other correlates of intelligence, such as education.
   Here we show that males used more low frequency words after an
   imaginary romantic encounter with a young female shown in a photograph
   relative to when they viewed photographs of older females. Females used
   fewer low frequency words when they imagined a romantic encounter with
   a young male shown in a photograph relative to when they viewed

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{381-403}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines the web-based virtual marriage game craze that
   emerged in the 1990s. These online interactive games may have opened up
   moments of liberation and formulated new ideologies of sexual
   relations. However, web-based marriages only ensure a male-dominated
   system and conform to dominant patriarchal standards - regardless of
   the number of females involved. Re-enacting the rules of marriage, the
   cyber game is ideologically directed against free unions, mobility,
   promiscuity, and parafamilial fluidity - all in order to stabilize
   individuals for reasons of social and political control; at the same
   time, it promotes the acquisition of skills needed by individual
   players in a free market, as if paralleling the drastic re-articulation
   of the economy. I understand the virtual game to be a safe haven for
   both China and the Chinese people to imagine that they can
   re-strengthen and re-virilize themselves in a rapidly changing world.
   They co-fabricate a depthless interface or a pure semblance of a
   looming powerful China ruled by a male-oriented system. Just as China
   dreams of achieving modernity through a consistent, dependable,
   controlled, and `clean' path, the virtual reality of the marriage game
   reveals a social imaginary in which contemporary Chinese people picture
   their social existence in an unstable transitional moment.}},

Pages = {{417-436}},
Abstract = {{`The end of sovereignty': this has been an ominous refrain in the
   chorus of global political and human rights analyses aimed at
   reformulating a post-Cold War configuration of world power. In cultural
   studies, the same pronouncement is more likely made through a mix of
   theoretical exuberance and ambivalence toward a post-nationalist and
   cosmopolitan imaginary. This essay takes as a point of departure the
   rise of `new sovereignties' - a fractured Westphalianism - as a rubric
   for understanding the political imagination about the international
   community today. It asks: to what dimensions of the regime of the new
   sovereignties can the human rights legal discourse as we know it today
   still exert influence, given the new configurations of globally
   disaggregated power? With human rights today reemerging as a
   bifurcation, how can cultural studies reconcile a theory of rights as
   subaltern claim-making with that of rights as an all-englobing tool in
   the neo-liberal order of world justice? Through a preliminary mapping
   of the moral-juridical and political forces that shape the regime of
   the new sovereignties, this essay attempts to illuminate why rights as
   international deontological politics is inadvertently complicit with
   the reproduction of rights as something constitutive of empire and

Journal = {{GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{175}},
Number = {{Part 2}},
Pages = {{146-159}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper seeks to reconsider the contemporary relevance of the
   resource frontier, drawing on examples of nature's commodification and
   enclosure under way in the peripheral Southeast Asian country of Laos.
   Frontiers are conceived as relational zones of economy, nature and
   society; spaces of capitalist transition, where new forms of social
   property relations and systems of legality are rapidly established in
   response to market imperatives. Customary property rights on the
   resource frontier can be seized by powerful actors in crucial political
   moments, preparing the territorial stage for more intensive phases of
   resource commodity production and accumulation. Relational frontier
   space is understood through the work of geographers such as Doreen
   Massey, who views the production of space as `constituted though the
   practices of engagement and the power-geometries of relations'. In
   Laos, a twenty-first century resource frontier is being driven by new
   corporate investments in natural resources, and a supporting array of
   land reform programmes. The paper focuses on both the material and
   representational aspects of the production of the resource frontier,
   through policy and discourse analysis, and village level research in
   Laos' Khammouane province. By rethinking a dualist and
   hierarchical-scaled imaginary of frontier places, both rural people and
   local ecologies are shown to be key actors, in a complex, relational
   reproduction of frontier zones. An emerging Lao spatial and political
   assemblage - a form of `frontier-neoliberalism' - is shown as producing
   dramatic changes in socio-natural landscapes, as well as new patterns
   of marginalisation and livelihood insecurity for a vulnerable rural
   population.}},

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{269-282}},
Abstract = {{This article intervenes in the project of theorizing the politics of
   reconciliation and transitional justice with the suggestion that (a)
   more attention be paid to subjective experiences and discursive
   sensitivities affected/shaped by the trauma of historical violence and
   injustice, and that (b) the constitutive as well as potentially
   subversive working of these experiences and sensitivities be
   recognized. It focuses specifically on Paul Celan (1920-1970), a
   Jewish-Romanian-German poet and Holocaust survivor, proposing a reading
   of his work that connects aspects of the poetic, the traumatic and the
   peripheral that are relevant to political theories of reconciliation
   and justice. Celan's work is shown to problematize the dominant
   understandings of communal temporality that are encoded in the
   reconciliatory transitional project. This temporality approximates a
   linear and progressive motion: the transitional community (a) leaves
   behind the legacies of the violent past and (b) imagines (and moves
   towards) its future as an emancipative movement positioned beyond the
   constraints of the historical violence and injustice. In Celan's work,
   however, the traumatized subject's experience of temporality is
   understood metaphorically as an impossible passage. In contrast to the
   linear and progressive unfolding of the collective imaginary, the
   movement within a passage is repetitive, elliptical and, quite
   literally, aporetic (impassible). There is no guarantee of a successful
   passing through; instead, within the passage, Celan's traumatic and
   poetic subject encounters the abysmal. This basic contrast suggests
   that a critical theory of reconciliation should not only account for
   the fragility of human life in relation to historical violence, but
   respond to the constant proximity of violence within the reconciliatory
   project itself.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary sociology has made sense of bodily difference by
   mobilising a number of tropes. `Wounded' (or vulnerable), `monstrous'

   tensions between the sociology of the body and Disability Studies. In

   Studies and suggest that while they can help to clarify the processes
   that bring about the misrecognition of disabled people, understanding
   the nature and scope of the lives of disabled people in modernity
   requires a more embodied language rather than one that has been
   generated from a sociological imaginary that is strongly influenced by
   a non-disabled subject position in which repulsion for the other -
   which one must become - is never fully resolved. Disability has had
   little impact on sociological theories of the body and when sociology
   ventures into disability it has tended to conflate it with an ontology
   of human frailty or gloss it with tropes that may be instructive about
   the generic or gendered modernist structure of exclusion but it tells
   us little about the specific forms of invalidation experienced by

Abstract = {{We have previously shown the visual form agnosic patient D.F. has
   spared sensorimotor utilization of visual information relative to her
   poor perceptual processing of the same stimulus attributes. Her
   visuomotor skills are, however, only normal when egocentric visual
   coding can be used in the task. In other words, her egocentric
   sensorimotor processing is intact while her `allocentric' coding of
   spatial position is impaired. The current investigation extends these
   previous observations by Comparing D.F.'s performance in bimanual
   pointing to pairs of stimuli directly (the egocentric task) versus
   pointing to the homologous positions on an adjacent workspace
   (pantomimed reaching, the allocentric task). The results showed greatly
   superior pointing accuracy in direct pointing compared to pantomimed
   pointing. The mechanisms supporting her limited but remaining
   sensitivity to spatial relationships during pantomimed pointing remain
   unknown. These residual skills may reflect partially spared categorical
   coding and/or internal sensorimotor self-cueing. Crown Copyright (C)

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to employ the concept of subjectivity taken
   front Lacanian psychoanalysis and Slavoj Zizek's idea of the law,
   enabled via its ``inherent transgression{''}, to critique the premises
   of neolibertarian theory about the market's superior ways of organizing
   society.
   Design/methodology/approach - An alternative conceptual framework is
   being developed and applied to the analysis of the transition from a
   planned to a market economy in former socialist countries using the
   example of informal payments in the health system in Russia. The
   proposed schema builds oil the idea of the subject eternally divided
   between the imaginary conceptions of the self/the other, and the
   socio-symbolic order, which is offered to theorize oil the role of
   phantasy in this transformation.
   Findings - The applied (psycho)-analytic schema reveals why the
   totalizing discourse of the market is no less tyrannical and no less
   totalitarian in its intent than the socialist ideology it opposes. The
   central argument is how dominant ideologies are made of, and stand for,
   an unattainable phantasy, as it was demonstrated in both socialism and
   the market.
   Originality/value - By re-engaging psychoanalysis to understand social
   and political projects and by unearthing the imaginary underpinnings of
   the symbolic order, the study argues for considering the phantasmatic
   dimensions of political and organizational transformations in
   management studies.}},

Abstract = {{Little change has been noted over 10 years of research into teacher

   blames the victim, and offers little analysis for the systemic reasons

   a lack of science knowledge. This paper reports on a study that
   examined teacher philosophy and pedagogical practices within the
   context of an analysis of children's concept formation within playful
   early childhood settings. Through teacher interviews, video recordings
   of science play, and photographic documentation of children's science
   activities in one rural preschool, it was noted that teacher philosophy
   about how young children learn is a significant contributing factor to
   learning in science. It is argued that teacher philosophy makes more of
   a difference to children's scientific learning than does teacher
   confidence to teach science or knowledge of science. The study also
   shows that without a mediational scientific framework for using

Title = {{BALANCED TRUTH: STEVEN SPIELBERG'S SCHINDLER'S LIST AMONG HISTORY,
   MEMORY, AND POPULAR CULTURE}},
Journal = {{HISTORY AND THEORY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{77-102}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Looking at the public reaction to it, one might say that Steven
   Spielberg's Schindler's List is undoubtedly the most successful film
   about the Holocaust. The film's success in the U.S. and other Western
   countries can be traced back mainly to the fact that it creates the
   impression of telling a true, apparently authentic, story.
   This essay investigates how this impression of historical truth and
   authenticity emerges in a fiction film. For this purpose the essay
   reverts to a concept developed by Jorn Rusen, which distinguishes among
   three dimensions of historical culture, namely political, aesthetic,
   and cognitive. In addition to the historical context that serves as a
   specific precondition for the film's success, the essay primarily
   investigates the strategies of authentication Spielberg applied at both
   the visual and narrative levels.
   The investigation concludes that the impression of evidence produced by
   the movie is significantly a result of the sophisticated balancing of
   the three dimensions mentioned above. The film utilizes artifacts of an
   existing and increasingly transnational (visual) memory for the benefit
   of a closed, archetypical narrative. It follows the aesthetic and
   artistic rules of popular narrative cinema, and largely recurs to
   conventions of representation that were common in film and television
   programs of the 1990s. Although these forms condense the historical
   course of events, the film manages to stay close to insights gained by
   historiography.
   The hybrid amalgamation of history and memory, and of the imaginary and
   the real, as well as the combination of dramaturgies of popular culture
   with an instinct for what can (not) be shown-all of these factors have
   helped Schindler's List to render a representation of the founding
   Holocaust myth in Western societies that can be sensually experienced
   while being emotionally impressive at the same time.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{36-45}},

Abstract = {{Places play an important role as anchoring fictional (books, movies,
   songs, video games) as well as artistic universes to reality.
   Conversely, imaginary places affect the way people perceive real
   places. `Set-jetting', which transforms film locations into tourist
   attractions, is a perfect example of the increasing demand for
   connecting fictional spaces with real places. The interaction of
   imaginary and real places, which has been for years an operating
   function of fiction, is increasing both qualitatively and
   quantitatively. This is not limited to cinema but also affects
   literature and art. Once located on a map, the fictional place becomes
   attractive for tourists and a potential source of profit. The
   connection between imaginary and real places has been transformed by
   recent dramatic changes in communication and information technologies,
   and more specifically in the domain of geospatial technologies. These
   technologies offer more effective ways of georeferencing locations in
   films, books and art works. Many Web sites compile information on film
   shooting locations. Geoparsing techniques offer solutions for
   automatically georeferencing novels or short stories. New technologies
   allow visitors practicing set-jetting or cultural tourism to collect
   extensive information about films or books related to these places.
   Geospatial technologies contribute to the development of an
   intermediary territory, a space between the real world and the fantasy
   world.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Far from being simply a highly diversified theme. the body, as the
   interpersonal space produced by literary and aesthetic exchange,
   transforms writing and reading into the site of an intense imaginary
   exchange. Something of the ``body{''} ceaselessly circulates beneath
   the letter, thus freeing itself from its social inscription. The text,
   the ``written{''} body. turns out to be, in its imaginary elaboration
   and re-elaboration, the substitute for the body that produced it, as
   well as an incitation to ``be as one{''} with the imaginary community
   it institutes - just as we are united in language. the mental avatar of
   the corporeity which founds our social coexistence. Most pertinent are
   the mythologies ofthe body elicited by the work of the text, both in
   production and in reception. Thus writing. a laborious endeavour of
   appropriation, and reading, an act of freedom and resistance. give rise
   to very specific anthropological variations, linked to the ways the
   body is imagined. Moreover. the work, once it has gone into the social
   space where it starts to really ``do its work{''}, lives in autonomous
   life and brings back to life an astonishing number of elementary myths.
   Nonetheless, when the reader ``metabolises{''} this ``corpus{''}, the
   ambiguity Of productions of the imagination emerges once again: isn't

Title = {{Is Religion an Evolutionary Adaptation?}},
Journal = {{JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Religious people talk about things that cannot be seen, stories that
   cannot be verified, and beings and forces beyond the ordinary. Perhaps
   their gods are truly at work, or perhaps in human nature there is an
   impulse to proclaim religious knowledge. If so, it would have to have
   arisen by natural selection. It is hard to imagine how natural
   selection could have produced such an impulse. There is a debate among
   evolutionary scientists about whether or not there is any adaptive
   advantage to religion at all (Bulbulia 2004a; Atran and Norenzayan
   2004). Some believe that it has no adaptive value itself and that it is
   just a hodge podge of of behaviors that have evolved because they are
   adaptive in other non-religious contexts. The agent-based simulation
   described in this article shows that a central unifying feature of
   religion, a belief in an unverifiable world, could have evolved along
   side of verifiable knowledge. The simulation makes use of an
   agent-based communication model with two types of information:
   verifiable information (real information) about a real world and
   unverifiable information (unreal information) about about an imaginary
   world. It examines the conditions necessary for the communication of
   unreal information to have evolved along side the communication of real
   information. It offers support for the theory that religion is an
   adaptive complex and it disputes the theory that religion is a
   byproduct of unrelated adaptive processes.}},

Abstract = {{At several points in his later writings Wittgenstein discusses
   imaginary forms of life and ways of thinking that appear queer or alien

   argue that reflection on the notions of difference and possibility in

   cases of concepts that are entirely unintelligible for us; rather they
   may represent possible, albeit distant, ways of thinking for us. Such
   cases serve to aid imaginative reflection on our own case(s). By making
   us appreciate the possibility of the strange, they help us better to
   appreciate the arbitrariness of the familiar. I end the paper by
   considering what the implications of this reading of Wittgenstein's
   position might be for Donald Davidson's rejection of conceptual

   research that is based on abductive logic. Abduction-based futures
   research approach proceeds from closed, imaginary future states to
   alternative, open theoretical frameworks or explanations. Unlike
   inductivists and deductivists believe, this procedure from the unknown
   to the known is rational, and therefore something that can be
   systematized and learned. There is a logic of discovery, and what could
   be a better place to apply and develop it than futures research. (C)

Abstract = {{This article introduces the recent sound works of Heidi Fast, a Finnish

   how these zones emerge as aesthetic, ethical and political concerns
   within Fast's work.
   Since 2005, Fast's sound works have variously taken shape as miniature
   concerts, social sculptures, imaginary sound-scapes and environmental
   music performances. Drawing upon the writings of theorists who have
   helped shape her practice, this article argues that Fast uses sound and
   voice to propose an `actualising philosophy'. This philosophy
   actualises virtualities (unrealised potentials), affecting
   transformative shifts through tiny mutations in perceptions and

   England, and Utopia-a fictional island society-is itself a commentary
   on the values and politics of More's society. This dual focus on the
   real and the ideal explains why this prosaic genre has intrigued so
   many commentators, notably Fredric Jameson, who (I argue) has written
   repeatedly about Utopia as a way to think through the unresolved
   implications of his own injunction to historicize. Working out of a
   commitment to historical materialism, Jameson has found it difficult to
   articulate hope for an alternative future that is itself appropriately
   historicized and not naively utopian. Analyzing More and Jameson in

Abstract = {{Calixthe Beyala is well known for her ambivalent relationship with both

   migration to the French hexagon. This article compares two novels
   encompassing this apparent divide - Tu t'appelleras Tanga (1988) and Le
   petit prince de Belleville (1992) - with a focus on Beyala's vision of
   the urban landscape as an inscription of a bilateral history. These
   texts present contrasting portraits of urbanism that seem to confirm
   the dichotomies of globalisation, and yet the juxtaposition suggests
   that ``global city{''} and ``megacity{''} alike come up against the
   interpretive predispositions of Beyala's reading public. While the
   narrative of the ``Third-World{''} slum city can be paralysed by the

   a tension between French republicanist universalism and the

Abstract = {{In Husserl's writings on fantasy, one could already find references to
   an important aspect of its function, the one of the consciousness

   is the main idea of his Imaginaire. However, this freedom conceals a
   fundamental duplicity or even triplicity. As Sartre puts it, ``the act
   of imagination is at the same time constituting, isolating and
   nihilating{''}. Consequently, the nihilistic and imaginary structure is
   identified in all the phases of consciousness as the essential
   definition of the relationship of human being to the world. To pose the
   world as the world or to nihilate (neantir) it is the same thing. In
   the description of L'etre et le Neant, consciousness finds Nothingness
   in its own sight which constitutes horizons and covers things with
   halos. It means that Nothingness enters the world together with the
   sight and is supposed to be considered as an intentionality functioning

Abstract = {{The Turkish Republic of North Cyprus (TRNC) aspires to take its place

   needs not only to be politically recognised as legitimate and to
   develop the kinds of economic and governance structures that signify a
   functional state, but also to produce a cultural imaginary of itself as
   a nation. In this paper, we mobilise Appadurai's theorisation of
   deterritorialisation, flows and context generation in order to examine
   the ways in which the implementation of educational reforms inTRNC
   might contribute to this ambition. We show that the ethnoscape and
   financescape combine to make education reform difficult, with specific
   challenges arising from the mixed commitment of the workforce, the
   capacity of the education bureaucracy to align support with policy
   mandates, and the `fit' between the policy and local needs. We conclude
   by suggesting that TRNC faces the dilemma of working with cultural
   heterogeneity: Appadurai identifies this as a key ideoscape challenge
   for all nation/states. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article uses a comparative analysis of two autobiographical texts

   Chevalier, an Auckland suburb which embodies much that is emblematic of
   the mythology of early- to mid-twentieth-century childhoods in New
   Zealand. Both a modern suburb in a fast-growing city, and a richly
   particular coastal environment, it makes itself available as the
   setting for a childhood of the national imaginary. But as each of these
   narratives crosses the suburban terrain it produces a different
   understanding of what it meant to grow up as a male then, and there: in
   Halfway Round the Harbour Keith Sinclair never questions the fit
   between boy and place, or the certainty of his belonging and his
   identity; Peter Wells in Long Loop Home recalls a tumultuous boyhood
   increasingly marked by the threat of exclusion and intense family
   conflict. Between the two opposing trajectories of these texts, other
   possibilities are glimpsed. Place is created here by gender, sexuality
   and class; and masculinity is shaped and positioned differently for
   each of these boyhoods and the men who reflect on them. The affect of
   place marks the difference between these two Point Chevs.}},

   normative space for Western military force. This is an expansive and
   open space in which the outsiders are gradually pulled into NATO's

   develop a psychoanalytic account of physical disability in order to
   open up possibilities for physical disability beyond its position as

   `sexuality' but can also be used to analyse `physical disability',
   indeed all aspects of one's subjectivity. I shall propose the
   appropriation of psychoanalysis to explain the construction of
   subjectivity, whether it is able-bodied or disabled in a way that
   parallels the male/female dichotomy. Within an able-bodied symbolic, in
   which the able-bodied takes itself as normal, it is impossible to
   illustrate the multiplicity of the disabled. Following Irigaray's claim
   that the ambiguity of female sexuality does riot conform, to male
   notions of sexuality, I argue that the complexity of the disabled body
   does not fit into the able-bodied norm of subjectivity. In this
   article, I shall be drawing on Irigaray's theory of embodied
   subjectivity to argue against the masculine-able-bodied-based theory of
   subjectivity found in Freud and Lacan.}},

Abstract = {{Implementation of a new system of geographical information system (GIS)
   maps based on aerial photos to administer EU agri-environmental support
   payments for organic farmers in Latvia in 2005 erupted into disputes

   leaving many disillusioned with the EU and considering withdrawal from

   demonstrates the complexities of EU accession for new member states,
   revealing the unintended consequences of the implementation of European
   policies in post-socialist contexts. Disputes over the organic land
   area reflect deeper cultural issues tied to the history of foreign
   domination. Furthermore, they represent a conflict surrounding ideas of
   space versus place. Abstract `maps from space' challenge farmers'

   2 replicated the distance effect (232 ms) and added a variable for

   years preceding its revival in the 1970s. The study follows a similar
   trajectory to the one outlined in various articles in the special issue
   of SFS devoted to the history of sf criticism (\#78, July 1999)-a
   growing awareness, first of all, that there are similarities between
   certain works which lead to attempts to group together such works as
   well as to identify what they have in common and to give this new genre
   a name. In the case of utopia, awareness of a new genre can be traced
   to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as writers imitate More's
   Utopia (1516), often taking advantage of the imaginary voyage to
   imagine alternative societies. Until the nineteenth century, however,
   most commentators continued to use such terms as ``political,{''}
   ``allegorical,{''} or ``philosophical{''} to refer to literary utopias,
   and it was only ill the nineteenth century that we can observe the
   emergence of the term utopia to designate these works. The next step
   (in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries) was to try to
   develop it canon of these works, one which, until the 1950s, often
   explicitly excluded science fiction. The study of utopia took on new
   life following the upsurge in utopian writing at the beginning of the
   1970s.}},

Abstract = {{Hygiene initiated a new process of a psychological emphasis. Hygiene
   invaded society and drugs became part of the living habits and
   introduced the duty of health, leading each person to take care of
   one's self. Hygiene is nothing more than a knowledge that has allowed a
   new salvation, a new exercise of regulation and surveillance. It's a
   knowledge that has structured society, transforming the population and
   each one in particular. This changing process has required from all of
   us a search of improvement from a new matrix, a new imaginary. A new
   mental world was created, new ways of thinking, feeling and acting were
   introduced in people's lives, and for this very reason we can say that
   a new soul was raised. From this new knowledge (which becomes power),
   each one questioned himself (thought) and built differently. In this
   sense, hygiene also is ``psi{''} knowledge.}},

   organizational identity discourse is informed by imaginary

   construction of coherent, unitary, and definably organizational
   identity discourse is validated by and validates conscious but illusory
   constructions of the self. The resulting discourse is inevitably
   disrupted by unconscious subjectivity and invariably fails. Therefore,
   the collective construction of fragmented, dynamic, and emergent
   organizational identity discourse is equally inevitable. While such
   discourse can be illusory, it also contains the opportunity for
   engaging in liberating struggles with identity as lack. The
   implications of this perspective for the theory and practice of
   organizational identity are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has used simulated interactions to investigate
   emotional and linguistic speech phenomena. Here, we evaluate the use of
   these simulated interactions by comparing speech addressed to imaginary
   speech partners produced by psychology students and actresses, to an
   existing study of natural speech addressed to genuine interaction
   partners. Simulated infant-(IDS), foreigner-(FDS) and adult-directed
   speech (ADS) was obtained from 10 female students and 10 female
   actresses. These samples were acoustically analysed and rated for
   positive vocal affect. Our results for affect for actresses and student
   speakers are consistent with previous findings using natural
   interactions, with IDS rated higher in positive affect than ADS/FDS,
   and ADS rated higher than FDS. In contrast to natural speech, acoustic
   analyses of IDS produced by student speakers revealed a smaller vowel
   space than ADS/FDS, with no significant difference between those adult
   conditions. In contrast to natural speech (IDS > ADS/FDS), the mean F-0
   of IDS was significantly higher than ADS, but not than FDS. Acoustic
   analyses of actress speech were more similar to natural speech, with
   IDS vowel space significantly larger than ADS vowel space, and with the
   mean FDS vowel space positioned between these two conditions. IDS mean
   F-0 of the actress speakers was significantly higher than both ADS and
   FDS. These results indicate that training plays an important role in
   eliciting natural-like speech in simulated interactions, and that
   participants without training are less successful in reproducing such
   speech. Speech obtained from simulated interactions should therefore be
   used with caution, and level of experience and training of the speakers
   should be taken into account. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   place in their inns. Those accusations penetrated into literature as

   deploying the fruit and the graft as tropes of both culture and nature.

Title = {{The conversion of Paul and that of Nasir Khusraw, a meeting at the
   imaginary museum of history}},
Journal = {{ETUDES THEOLOGIQUES ET RELIGIEUSES}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{507+}},
Abstract = {{Knowledge of Nasir Khusrav allows one to discover in Paul many things
   that would otherwise pass unnoticed. Both have experienced a
   conversion. Both belonged to a minority in their own religion. Both
   have become missionaries. Both endured persecution. Both have added to
   their missionary activity a literary activity. And both have produced a
   non literal exegesis, of the Bible for one and of the Koran for the
   other. Each of these points would deserve a comparative study. However,
   the present essay focuses on the issue of conversion. Nasir Khusrav
   reports unique and extraordinary experiences, a vision in particular.
   Yet the two stories of his conversion suggest a lengthy quest for
   orientation in relation to his journey to Cairo and Mecca, although it
   must have started before. We might describe this as a gradual
   conversion. In contrast, Paul's experience on the road to Damascus has
   been commonly pictured as the perfect illustration of a sudden
   conversion. Beside various studies in psychology of religion dedicated
   to the forms of conversion, some analogies with Nasir Khusraw's
   conversion draw our attention to aspects of Paul's story which hint at
   a fairly long period of reorientation related -as in the case of Nasir
   Khusraw- to a journey to the centre of his religion. It started with a
   more intense practice of traditional Judaism, with commitment to
   pharisaic thought and with the study of Law. This has been carried on
   and increased into ``zeal{''} and has found its fulfilment in Paul's
   conversion to Christianity. We might speak of a gradual conversion for
   Paul too, although it does not follow a linear progression. The stories
   he tells about his conversion are performative texts. They emphasise
   unique events in order to promote allegiance to the values of the new
   community and abandonment of the old values. We have no reason to
   question the authenticity of Paul's experience of the suddenness of his
   conversion, but it is doubtful that this experience can be isolated
   from the entire context of his life. The event on the road to Damascus
   could be seen as the culmination and resolution of a crisis of
   reorientation which had probably been going on for some time. To be
   sure, Nasir Khusraw's fascination for the Fatimid rulers and Paul's
   conversion to the crucified Messiah also display differences and
   oppositions. It can then be illuminating to make these two figures meet
   in the imaginary museum of history.}},

   the regionalism/landscape dialectic function within the historical
   co-construction of regional politics and places? The regional capital
   of Valencia has developed in symbiosis with (and often at the expense
   of) its surrounding croplands. If L'Horta has served as a traditional
   referent for Valencian regionalist discourse, however, accelerating
   urbanization has caused sonic to rearticulate Valencianism as
   nationalist resistance to urban speculation and economic globalization,
   contesting the legitimacy of regional government. But this regionalist
   landscape continues to disappear in the face of new Valencian spaces
   and the new regional imaginaries they are said to represent. Tracing
   the historical co-construction of regional politics and place
   highlights the dynamic importance Of the regionalism/landscape
   dialectic in Europe. Elsewhere I have analyzed the hyper-modern
   landscapes of entrepreneurial regionalism emerging in Spain. Here I
   explore the iconographic landscapes that preceded them, revealing the

Pages = {{117-124}},
Abstract = {{In an exploratory, qualitative study, 11 professional actors were
   interviewed about their childhoods to investigate the early predictors
   of acting talent. To control for verbal talent,
   scientists-turned-lawyers were selected as a comparison group.
   Participants were asked about their families, schooling, and training,
   as well as about their early propensities for play and imagination,
   their orientation towards fiction, and their emotionality and
   attunement to others' mental states. Actors' childhood memories
   differed from those of the lawyers in the following respects. The
   actors recalled greater engagement in alternative worlds (imaginary and
   fictional worlds) and in inner worlds (emotional and other mental
   states). Not surprisingly, then, they were also more likely to recall
   feeling different from others and unable to engage fully in school.
   Unlike the lawyers, the actors recalled practicing for their adult
   roles as early as age 4by inventing and directing plays in their
   backyards. Unlike lawyers, actors chose their careers despite parental
   discouragement: although their parents valued the arts, they
   discouraged the choice of acting as a career. Taken together, the
   results suggest that an early interest in alternative and inner worlds
   and an identification of oneself as different from others are
   predictive of early and steady involvement in theatera choice of career
   in which one can live daily in another world of imagined lives and in
   the other world of others' mental lives.}},

Abstract = {{Post-Todorovian fantastic discourse extends Todorov's argument
   concerning the significance of taking figurative meanings literally.
   His assumption that the supernatural is born of language is extended to
   mean ``language creates reality{''} or language refers to ``another
   possible reality{''} thanks to the animated hypotyposis and metalepsis.
   The extreme representation of hypotyposis often brings forth
   metalepsis, which underlies Gerard Genette's treatise on metalepsis:
   from figure to fiction. Metalepsis can be employed to effect
   transgression on three different levels: that of the author and his/her
   product, that of the diegetic story and the hypodiegetic story, and,
   finally, that of the reader and the work. Contemporary fantastic
   fiction, revolving as it often does around the theme of books and
   stories, takes the figure of hypotyposis literally in order to
   transgress diegetic frames. The represented reader, who exists on the
   diegetic level, thus interferes on a hypodiegetic level in the work

   read by diegetic characters to interfere in the diegetic fictional
   world. This article attempts to examine the functioning of these three
   different modes in a variety of literary texts. Firstly, in subscribing
   to the fantastic tradition of hesitation, the narrative Mobius strip of
   ambiguity emerges on the threshold between hypotyposis and metalepsis.
   Secondly, as the diegetic fantastic story intrudes into the
   intradiegetic narration, the mise en abyme becomes metaleptic. And
   finally, the magic metalepsis of words that spins a fantastic diegetic
   world is intruded into by existences on a hypodiegetic level.}},

   regulatory products emanating from hegemonic discourses that belong to

   analyze, based on a trialogue, how different identities are interwoven
   and overlapped in a regulated world supported by a controlling
   discourse on good manners, translated into the construction of an
   imaginary about normal, universal and unified citizenship that reveals
   how the control society operates its own mechanisms of vigilance and
   punishment. Finally, a space is generated for the emancipating
   reflection of those who, being different, aspire to have a space in
   what is supposed to be normality; emphasizing reconciled identities as
   a basis for constructing inclusive citizen logics, because we suppose
   that these harbor the sense of tolerance that complements diversity and

Abstract = {{H. Wanner, J. Butikofer: Holocene Bond Cycles: real or imaginary? -
   Geografle-Sbornik CGS, 113, 4, pp. 338-350 (2008). - During the
   Holocene (last 12,000 years) nine cold relapses were observed mainly in
   the North Atlantic Ocean area and its surroundings. Based on the
   pioneering studies by Bond et al. (1997, 2001) these events are called
   Bond Cycles and thought to be the Holocene equivalents of the
   Pleistocene Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles. The first event was the Younger
   Dryas (similar to 12,000 BP; Broecker 2006), the last one was the
   Little Ice Age (AD 1350-1860; Grove 1988). A number of trigger
   mechanisms is discussed (see Table 1), but a theory for the Bond Cycles
   does not exist. Based on spectral analyses of both, forcing factors and
   climatological time series, we argue that one single process did likely
   not cause the Holocene cooling events. It is conceivable that the early
   Holocene coolings were triggered by meltwater pulses. However, the late
   Holocene events (e.g., the Little Ice Age) were rather caused by a
   combination of different trigger mechanisms. In every case it has to be
   taken in mind that natural variability was also playing a decisive role.}},

Abstract = {{Questions of diversity and multiculturalism are at the heart of many
   discussions oil European supranational identity within contemporary
   anthropology, sociology, cultural studies, linguistics and so on. Since
   we are living in a period marked by the economic and political changes
   which emerged after European unification, a call for a new analysis of
   heterogeneity, cultural difference and issues of belonging is not
   surprising. This call has been fuelled by the European Union's concern
   with ``culture{''} as one of the main driving forces for constructing
   ``European identity{''}. While the official European policy describes
   European culture as common to all, Europeans, Europe is also seen as
   representing ``unity in diversity{''}. By analysing contemporary
   European MEDIA policies and programs this article attempts to
   contribute to a small but growing body of work, that explores what role
   ``language{''} and ``visual images{''} play in the process of
   constructing European culture and supranational European identity. More
   specifically, the article explores the complex articulation of language
   and culture in order to analyse supranational imaginary of European
   identity as it is expressed through the simple slogan ``Europe: unify
   in diversity{''}. We initially grounded our interest in the politics of
   identity within the European Union within theoretical frameworks of
   ``power and knowledge{''} and ``identity and subjectivity{''}. We
   consider contemporary debates in social sciences and humanities over
   the concepts of ``language{''}, ``culture{''} and ``identity{''}, as
   inseparable front each other (Ahmed 2000(1); Brah 1996(2), 2000(3);
   Butler 1993(4), Derrida 1981(5); Gilroy 2004(6); Laclau 1990(7)).
   Cultural and postcolonial studies theorists (e.g. Brah 1996(2); Bhabha
   1994(8); Hall 1992(9) 1996(10) among others) argue that concepts of
   ``culture{''} and ``identity{''} signify a historically variable nexus
   of social meanings. That is to say, ``culture{''} and ``identity{''}
   are discursive articulations. According to this view, ``culture{''} and
   ``identity{''} are not separate fields from economic, social and
   political issues, on the contrary ``culture{''} and ``identity{''} are
   constructed through social, economic and political relations. Issues of
   ``language{''} and ``images{''} are central to both of them. By
   questioning the role that ``language{''} and ``visual images{''} play
   in the construction of European identity and culture, we are
   considering ``language{''} as well as ``visual images{''} not just as
   representations, but also as forms of social action. In addition to
   that, inspired by discourse theory (Laclau 1985(11), 1994(12),
   2007(13)) and psychoanalysis (Zizek 1989(14), 1993(15), 1994(16);
   Stavrakakis 1999(17), 2005(18), 2007(19)) we explore the libidinal
   dimension of identification processes. We focus on the European MEDIA
   Programme in order to analyse how different languages and images are
   being used to create a sense of ``European unity in diversity{''}.
   Along with Stavrakakis we argue that due to the lack of libidinal
   investment into discourses of Europeanness, Europe is failing to create
   a strong supranational identity. However we also show that there have
   been recent attempts by European policy makers to try and fill this gap
   through various projects Which focus entirely on emotions; which
   appears to reinforce new possibilities of identification with Europe.}},

Abstract = {{One of the proposed projects by the Chilean Government for the

   symbolic asset of society which must be understood from its social,
   political and economic dimensions.

Abstract = {{As a practice when designing, we architects use certain expressions.
   The question raised in this article is related to the transformation of
   these expressions, thanks in part to the implementation of other
   mechanisms - some imaginary - considering the ``effective{''} use of
   contemporary means of representation.
   Besides allowing us to ``visualize{''} a project, the object of
   architectonic representation presumes the management of certain codes
   that describe the aim of a project. Representation is raised as a
   problem in communication produced by certain gestures which purpose is
   to present the materialization and effect of an idea. As a product of
   the contemporaneous vortex, many representational systems have been
   transformed by dynamic processes of presentation and planning
   evaluation (which operate basically with notions of time and
   organization). This article suggests possible constructions in the face
   of this new paradigm which has been institutionalized by the academy in
   Chile.}},

Abstract = {{While narrative embedding in Michel Butor's La Modification (1957) as

   virtual embedded narratives in the form of imaginary scenarios that
   contain the characters' plans, expectations, wishes and fears. These
   scenarios, formulated as possibilities, but later negated or
   unrealized, constitute what Gerald Prince calls the disnarrated. The
   various functions of the disnarrated in the novel at the level of
   discourse as well as at the level of story are discussed in this study:
   the metafictional quality of the narrative; the intratextual
   relationships between the embedded and the embedding narratives; the
   relationship between the narrator and the narratee; and, the
   narrative's tellability.}},

   conception of the dialectic. This Hegelian imaginary reflects the
   intellectual history of radical and/or critical anglophone geography.
   Yet, dialectics can be read in a non-Hegelian, much less totalizing and

   space for considering parallels between dialectics, the assemblages of
   Deleuze and Guattari, and aspects of complexity theory.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the disparities between the ideological discourses
   and material outcomes of three key urban policies, contextually
   grounded within the neoliberalised social and institutional spaces of
   Over-the-Rhine, Cincinnati. Whilst the rhetoric of neoliberal doctrine
   presents an emancipatory urban imaginary based upon individual freedom
   and the beneficent role of free markets, the embedding of the policies
   discussed accentuates the political and economical disenfranchisement
   of the most marginalised neighbourhood inhabitants. Moreover, the
   ability of this group to politically mobilise against hostile
   neoliberalisation and gentrification is undermined by the facilitation
   of out-migration of stable low-income families and community leaders,
   and the reproduction of the negative, criminal, and blighted aspects of
   Over-the-Rhine's environment. Neoliberalisation is seen to operate
   through material and discursive moments of social exclusion and in
   perpetuating sociospatial structures which justify the continued
   implementation of repressive political and regulatory projects. In
   concluding, I suggest neoliberal hegemony may be undermined through
   exposing the ways in which it reproduces and exacerbates the phenomena
   it condemns.}},

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-75}},
Abstract = {{This article examines the cultural field of fitness as a network of
   producers, consumers, products and practices that has developed around
   the care of the body through physical exercise. Drawing on a thematic
   text analysis of US exercise manuals, the paper focuses on how the
   commercial fitness field naturalizes associations between physical
   exercise and leisure, and between leisure and self-work. In particular,
   the analysis examines three themes and their relevance to our broader
   understanding of leisure in contemporary consumer society: the
   management of leisure time; the use of leisure for self-investment
   strategies; and the promotion of consumption as the framework for
   leisure and an accompanying notion of pleasure. The fitness field casts
   light on how leisure more generally is constructed as a sphere of
   obligations to make productive use of one's time, to improve one's body
   and self, and to do so through the wares of the consumer marketplace.
   The cultural imaginary of leisure as a time of freedom from work and
   responsibility is thus recast, in an age of individualization, as a
   time of freedom to accomplish the work of self-production.}},

Abstract = {{In his article ``Metamorphosing Worlds in the Cinema of the
   Fantastic{''} Juan Gonzalez Etxeberria reads fantastic films as
   appealing products of both unconscious psychological and
   institutionalized sociological anxieties. A result of the binary
   opposition of rhetorical strategies that shaped modern culture, the
   genre is an open door to other worlds where to dream of uncertainties
   and to indulge in our traumas. Its transgressive indeterminacy against
   the Cartesian system is traced from the origin of creative filmic
   language to postmodern disturbing fantasies about the unknown, having
   social control and individual free will as the only limits of its
   imaginary trips across time and space. Technical and financial
   restraints, on the one hand, and mystical and revolutionary ambitions,
   on the other, have configured a genre that has lately become an even
   more polysemic and polymorphic universe, where computer-generated
   simulations fulfil human desires and seek pleasure through a new vision
   of the body, a site where natural and cultural orders fade away.
   Resemblance to actual places or to persons living or dead, especially
   the latter, is never coincidental.}},

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{149-171}},
Abstract = {{Children's role play activities are included in symptom checklists of
   dissociative disorders, yet little is known about the potential
   relation between individual differences in role play and dissociative
   behaviors in normative development. This issue was examined in a study
   of 147 children aged 3 and 4 from a nonclinical population. Parents
   completed the Child Dissociative Checklist (CDC; F. W. Putnam, K.
   Helmers, \& P. K. Trickett, 1993) and a questionnaire about their
   child's role play, fears, behavior problems, and dreams. Children were
   also interviewed about these same items. Dissociation was significantly
   related to parent report of fears, problem behaviors, and nightmares.
   These results are consistent with the view that CDC scores reflect some
   degree of difficulty in children's lives. Children who engaged in role
   play, particularly children with imaginary companions, scored higher on
   the CDC than other children. However, role play was not related to the
   measures of fears or problem behaviors. The results suggest that a
   distinction between pathological and nonpathological dissociation is
   warranted, with role play activities being more closely linked to the
   latter. Measurement of dissociation in preschoolers is discussed.}},

   approach to space found in Pierre Nepveu's novels, poems and essays. In
   Nepveu's work, these tensions (between representations of cities and

   modernity) are usually the product of an imaginary dynamic that might
   be described, following Bakhtin, as ``exotopic{''}-where here can only
   be understood in terms of elsewhere, through a look exterior to a place
   that is already known and dwelled in. The issue of dwelling stands out
   in Nepveu's poetry and prose (novels and essays): how can one dwell in
   the world's insurmountable disorder? How can one write about space,
   explore its interiors and spiritual landscapes, at a time when
   everything is in transit and in transition, and when places become
   entwined with non-places? Raising these issues provides a way of
   exploring a number of places in which the writer Nepveu has dwelt or

Abstract = {{Cognitive scientists have argued that concepts such as gods and ghosts
   are found the world over because they violate a small number of

   (MCI) and are theorized to be essential components of religion.
   Previous studies have explored MCI concepts in Christianity, Hinduism,
   Ancient Rome, and a variety of imaginary alien civilizations, but none
   have addressed the world's largest religion, Islam. This study applies
   research on MCI concepts, together with work on theological
   correctness, to a dataset of 295 Islamic sermons from 2001 to 2006
   prepared by the Directorate of Religious Affairs, it government agency
   in Turkey charged with managing the country's mosques and religious
   education. Using content analysis, this paper tests whether
   counterintuitive god concepts are its sparse as MCI theory would
   predict (they are) and whether god concepts vary as expected in
   contexts of prayer (they do). Comparison of god concepts in sermons
   written before and after the arrival of new leadership at the
   Directorate shows that institutional change has altered religious
   discourse, decreasing the presence of intuitive but not
   counterintuitive concepts. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4, Sp. Iss. SI}},
Pages = {{363-366}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that a predominant tendency ill creative
   generation tasks is to base new ideas on well-known, specific instances
   of previous ideas (e.g., basing ideas for imaginary aliens on dogs,
   cats or bears). However, a substantial minority of individuals has been
   shown to adopt more abstract approaches to the task and to develop more
   original products as a result. Because domain knowledge is sometimes
   thought to be associated with more abstract representations, it is
   possible that these individual differences are linked to how much
   people have learned about the domain in question. The present study
   explored the relationship between domain knowledge, the tendency to
   rely on specific domain instances and both the originality and
   practicality of outcomes in a task in which participants designed novel
   sports. In addition to designing novel sports, participants rated their
   own knowledge about and participation in sports, and they took a short
   test of spoil knowledge. As in previous Studies, there were individual
   differences in approaches to the task, and participants who relied on
   specific known spoils (e.g., basketball) produced less original
   designs. Neither the measures of sport knowledge nor the measure of
   spoil participation related to the tendency to rely on specific
   instances in developing the novel sports or to the originality of those
   creations. However, there were links between tested knowledge and the
   rated practicality of the designs. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{404-416}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In addition to the usual question underlying empiricist epistemology,
   namely how we are to judge our sensory experience, Diderot raises the
   question as to how we are to judge our reading experience, explicitly
   asking `Madame', the reader, to come to a view as to whether his
   presentation of the blind man of Puiseaux as a real person is
   persuasive or not. This essay, building on an earlier article published
   in French Studies Bulletin (2006) which provided original evidence as
   to the historical reality of the blind man, revisits the question as to
   his imaginary, nature by, arguing for the intertextual presence of
   Montaigne's description of `un gentil-homme de bonne maison, aveugle
   nay' in the `Apologie de Raimond Sebond'. The presence of this
   intertext, which has not been identified as such before, suggests that
   in order accurately to judge his or her reading experience the reader
   requires knowledge of the Lettre's literary and philosophical context,
   a view which is echoed in a different form in Diderot's discussion of
   Molyneux's Question. In Diderot's view, the woman who sees for the
   first time will be unable to judge her sensory experience and unable
   therefore to answer Molyneux's Question, if she does not have knowledge
   of the question's metaphysical and mathematical background. Where other
   readers have recently argued that the Lettre emphasizes the importance
   of language in understanding experience, this essay thus argues that
   the Lettre also makes a case for the importance of a literary and
   philosophical education in our understanding and judgement of
   experience, be it visual or textual.}},

Abstract = {{Interconnections between fascism and colonialism and between
   antisemitism and colonial racism, perceived by post-war theorists of
   racialized violence such as Hannah Arendt and Aime Cesaire, have for a
   long time fascinated a number of writers and filmmakers in post-war
   France, yet their works are not often received from this point of view.
   This article considers Georges Perec's W ou le souvenir d'enfance
   (1975) and Patrick Modiano's Dora Bruder (1997) to show how these are
   not simply post-Holocaust works but contain an overlapping vocabulary,
   imagery and, ultimately, history of racism, dehumanization and
   apocalyptic violence which embraces the Holocaust and Empire. It also
   argues that the interconnections sought by the post-war generation of
   theorists of modern forms of violence can be more clearly exposed in
   imaginative works (rather than historical or sociological works)
   because these blur the frontiers between the literary imagination,
   memory and history. Repetitions, substitutions and transformations -
   the very substance of the literary imagination - open up an alternative
   history (though one announced by Arendt and others), which challenges
   the compartmentalization of metropolitan history, colonial history and
   the history of European genocide.}},

Abstract = {{This article takes as its starting point Sartre's interpretation of the
   reading experience as an appeal to our freedom and our existence as a
   unique project, which can take shape through our imagination. However,
   this view largely ignores our bodily involvement in the reading
   process, which runs off with this very freedom. A Lacanian approach of
   the fantasy could be more useful to conceptualise this involvement, but
   psychoanalysis has an all-too negative view of the imaginary that is
   aroused by the interaction between the reader's fantasy and the text. A
   possible synthesis can be found in Foucault's notion of the demon,
   referring to the imaginary double which confronts us both with the
   repetition of our fantasies in the act of reading and with the chance
   to change ourselves through this very repetition. Foucault's research
   into the classical technique of the hypomnemata ultimately allows us to
   integrate this `demonic' involvement in a contemporary reading praxis.}},

Abstract = {{Social suffering has-been studied in several circumstances by-Brazilian
   researchers, usually associated with socially excluded people who are
   victims of violence and chronic poverty. Special attention has been

   deal with the Medical Anthropology concept-of social suffering,

   searching for a dialogue between social suffering, health, and gender
   questions. Her conceptions about mental imagery and women's daily
   resistance to hegemonic discourses under violence and social suffering
   support a new perspective on women's body use and care. We conclude
   that such modality of women's resistance in Veena Das' view can be
   useful to conduct studies and social intervention's concerning
   Brazilian women submitted to suffering and inequality. Listening to
   young and poor Brazilian Women speak about the way they can (not)
   control their destiny and define life projects could offer clues to
   intervene in health promotion contexts. Under imaginary movements

   of especial relevance for the history of social and religious

   17th centuries. The author aims to unravel how it was that such an
   abstruse and seemingly foreign-to-everyday-concerns theological subject
   turned into a social issue. Rooted in the theological discourse
   concerning human nature as ``stained{''}, the concept of ``original
   sin{''} began in the 13th century to be understood in terms of
   ``infidelity{''}. In 1215, the 4th Lateran Council established a system
   of signs as markers for ``infidels{''}, the first step toward an
   assimilation of the notions of fidelity/infidelity into those of
   trustworthiness/unloyalty which would later mean the association of the
   concept of original sin with that of the sin of the converts. In
   addition, the jural notions of Pactum and Fides, basis of the Feudal
   Contract, would inform the relationships between Man and God.
   Worshiping the Precious Blood of Jesus would impinge upon the so-called
   statutes for ``Cleanliness{''} and ``Nobility{''} of blood. This
   statutory definition of one's blood would pass to one's descendants,
   its formulation in terms of purity/impurity determining one's social
   integration or exclusion.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider how the folk arc produced and consumed at
   the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival (Jazz Fest). Founded in the
   aftermath of the civil rights movement as a cosmopolitan gathering of
   music, food, and art lovers, Jazz Fest has become one of the world's
   largest music festivals. The staging of the festival in the wake of
   Hurricane Katrina was seen as a symbol of the reviving spirit of New
   Orleans and showcased thefestival as an icon of the city. Blackness and
   other forms of otherness are central to producing a concentrated
   experience of cosmopolitanism there and to constructing a ``hip{''}
   identity. Festgoers and producers arc ``in the know{''} about the folk,
   even as they are separated from them by race, class, and/or education.
   Those who produce the folk participate in an imaginary leveling of
   difference, while festival visitors experience the spine-tingling
   transcendence of musical communion. At the same time, folk artists,
   demonstrators, vendors, and performers are tightly disciplined by the
   structures that specify precise limits on what they can and cannot do.
   A close examination of the production of culture at the New Orleans
   jazz and Heritage Festival reveals a reproduction of a racialized
   social structure in which people of color (mostly African Americans)
   and other ``folks{''} are sidelined while owner-connoisseurs are able
   to control presentation and production.}},

Abstract = {{This essay examines how the black racial significance of hip hop

   locales use the performative contours of hip hop to mobilize notions of
   black-self in ways that are at one time both contestive and
   transcendent of nationally bound racial framings. Hip hop in this way
   can be seen as enabling a current global (re)mapping of black political
   imaginaries via social dynamics of diaspora. In pursuing this argument,
   this essay looks toward hip hop movements in Brazil, Cuba, and South
   Africa as compelling, yet varying examples of how transnationally

Abstract = {{When considering the intersection between geographical knowledge and
   geopolitical practice, emphasis generally falls on the state and the
   state's self-serving calculations. This paper, instead, focuses on
   geopolitical civil society, emphasizing the role that rationalized
   norms and emotive care-ethics play in molding and facilitating certain
   forms of geographical knowledge and subsequent foreign interventions.
   The case to illuminate this theoretical focus centers on American
   evangelical actors and their specific geopolitical vision, which is
   largely based on the perceived universal authority of the Bible. The
   case illustrates how the religious normative imperative to evangelize
   the world has led to geographically blunt imaginaries that present
   spaces of alterity as being in urgent need of spiritual and also
   geopolitical intervention. Opposed to such imaginaries, however, this
   paper also traces the emergence of an ethics of care that has developed
   within evangelical circles regarding the people of southern Sudan. This
   more specific and immediately felt ethical impulse is shown to maintain
   a more nuanced understanding of heterotopic place. It is argued that
   there is a frequent clash between such universalist ethical impulses,
   which tend to code global space according to a particular normative
   paradigm, and particularist ethical impulses, which are based on a
   care-ethics that is rooted in an attachment too and an understanding of
   a particular place. This paper makes the case that, given the right
   communication channels, these varying ethical impulses can lead to a
   transformative communication in which universalist geopolitical visions
   are adapted to place-specific heterotopic geographical realities.}},

   the methods and sources of the history of books and reading can
   contribute to the making of a more reflective social history of the
   XIXth h century. The article highlights the proliferation of social
   descriptions in the 1830s and 1840s, which developed into a true social
   imaginary, a repertoire of textual and iconographic representations of
   society. Studying how these texts were appropriated - by ordinary
   readers as well as through critical debates shows how realist
   literature was thus able to contribute to the creation of individual
   and collective social identities and experiences, as well as how the
   question of the sociological relevance of these fictions was fiercely
   debated. The realist novel of the early XIXth century thus constitutes
   a major element in the very production of ``society{''} and its images,
   within a cultural universe in which literature was largely credited
   with an ability to accurately depict the world.}},

Abstract = {{This article employs theoretical tools devised by Michel Foucault to
   explore the political rationale, technologies of government, and
   unintended consequences of UN efforts at statebuilding and
   democratization in the context of the peacekeeping operation in Haiti.
   It aims to offer an empirically oriented contribution to the study of
   the modalities of international intervention in the post-Cold War
   period and the effects of transplanting institutional models. The
   article shows that the UN's political imaginary can be traced back to
   the texts that guided the reform of punishment institutions in
   Classical Europe. The United Nations saw its effort at statebuilding as
   centered upon making local institutions disciplined, visible, and
   centralized. The failure of the UN to achieve its stated goals is
   appraised in the contingent modalities of the encounter between an
   ethnocentric political imaginary that takes for granted that modalities
   of government can be transplanted with benign effects and local
   conditions of extreme poverty. The article concludes that, while
   purporting to build an independent, democratic, and well-functioning
   state, unreflectively imported political models foster disorder and
   dependence. They also reinforce the instruments of control and
   conditionality in the hands of international actors, thus fostering the

   further show that variations of the ERPONSET amplitude with the

Abstract = {{Analysis of `neoliberalism' in recent geographical work has usefully
   drawn attention to the manner in which certain political-economic ideas
   resonate with a diverse range of state projects, policy objects and

   virtue of being embedded in practices of governance at the local level,
   a dimension that has been given less attention in existing research.

   also our perception of social reality itself. The main focus is Lacan's
   theory of sexual difference, understood as a universal antagonism (
   Real) that cuts across any attempt at symbolizing reality. By

   aim is to identify a specific cinematic context where the excess of

Abstract = {{In this essay, I engage recent scholarship of Gongora's Soledades
   (1613) to show that, far from a radical critique of imperialism, the
   poem advances a strategic vision of a restructured empire capable of
   reversing Spain's decline, already tangible by the beginning of the
   seventeenth century. By historicizing the Soledad primera in the
   context of the contemporary writings of Spanish arbitrista Martin
   Gonzalez de Cellorigo, I suggest that Gongora's social milieu was
   steeped in economic and social theory actively critiquing and
   reimagining Spain's imperial project. In section one, I contextualize
   the Soledades within this transatlantic imaginary based on the
   increasing importance of production and circulation of commodities in
   contemporary economic theory. In section two, I suggest through a close
   reading of key passages from the Soledad primera that Gongora's use of
   space, informed by these social and economic projects and early modern
   European mercantilism, proposes a poetic but concrete solution for
   (re)producing the Spanish Empire, transforming it from an `extractive'

   Furthermore, the encounter between the Caribbean baroque and indigenous
   expression displays Lezama Lima's vision of history as an endless
   becoming which makes possible the coming together of cultures that

Abstract = {{According to a popular view, the past is present here and now. This is
   presentism combined with endurantism: the past continuously persists
   through time to the present. By contrast, I argue that memories,
   memorials, and histories are of entities discontinuous with present
   experiences, and that the continuity between past and present in them
   is a construct. Memories, memorials, and histories are semantic means
   for dealing with the past. My presupposition that past and present are
   different is supported by grammar: as verbal tenses show, the past is
   not present here and now, for otherwise it would not be past. A failure
   to note this difference is a lack of chronesthesia, a sense of time
   specific to human beings. I argue that presentism fails to account for
   the temporal structures of memory and the changes in perspective as we
   switch from the present to a past situation. My account is perdurantist
   in the sense that it allows for temporal parts of things such as
   memorials or tombstones, as well as events such as wars or
   commemorations. But my main goal is to outline a semantic approach to
   the past: the tie between past and present actions and events is the
   semantic ground-consequence relation: a past event is the antecedent
   grounding a present situation, explaining why it is the case. In
   addition, I show how we refer to the past by means of two rhetorical
   figures of speech: synecdoche, using the (emblematic-) part-whole
   relation for relating the past to the present by transposing its sense;
   and anaphor, which has a deictic function-it points back toward the
   past. In references to the past, the deictic field is a scene
   visualized by the speaker and addressees: the deictic field is
   transposed from a perceptual to an imaginary space.}},

   to explore these contradictions by rereading the globalization of gay

   understood in terms of self-identification (subscription rather than

   preliminary exploration of how globalization carries the potential for
   an ethics of sexual difference grounded on indeterminacy and

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{617-630}},
Abstract = {{This article introduces a symposium on religion and the formation of
   modern urban space in Asia and Africa. Both the spread of new religious
   movements and the articulations between religion, globalization and
   neoliberalism have prompted new analyses of the shifting geographic and
   social boundaries between `religious' and `secular' institutions,
   practices and discourses, and about the meaning of `religion' itself.
   We reinscribe work on urban religion within a discussion of `modernity'
   by dealing with the socio-spatial mediation of religion and its role in
   redefining public spaces, practices, norms and discourses in
   contemporary cities. Individual articles map the spaces engendered by
   religious imaginaries and the forms of mobility and networks that
   religion relies on and constitutes, and they identify and analyze the
   roles played by mass media in religious practice and institution
   building, as well as the embodied nature of urban religious experience.
   They demonstrate how urban studies can be `pluralized' and
   `vernacularized' through analyses of how the urban realm is constituted
   in part through religious practice and meaning. Our attention to the
   articulation of religion with cities in Asia and Africa will also help
   to foster a new theoretical vocabulary within religious studies that is
   attentive to the historical, cultural and spatial contingencies of
   religion as a category of analysis.}},

   subjectification from a psychoanalytic perspective. Drawing on the
   recent work of Nancy Chodorow to analyse girls' descriptions of their
   favourite texts and imagined futures, I demonstrate how subjectivity is
   a personal as well as cultural construction. Girls' experience of
   themselves as gendered subjects is not simply a direct internalisation
   of stories and characters but a complex psychodynamic process whereby
   texts and other cultural and discursive phenomena are given emotional
   tonality and personal meaning. These personal meanings are just as
   powerful in the formation of subjective gender as are discourse and

Abstract = {{Current theories concerning the social and material construction of

   socio-spatiality, to discuss passengers as spatially distributed

   how these heterogeneous passengers craft their travel times as an
   effect of their travel time use; how socio-material interactions with
   pens, papers, puzzles and electricity pylons make time. Following
   Michel Serres, it also suggests how passenger time is not a simple flow
   but a percolation, and how these passenger times coalesce in train
   carriages to form communities. The paper is itself a journey, in the

Abstract = {{The potential of consumption to figure as a site of political agency is
   now recognized by both corporate capitalism and its No Logo opposition.
   Many now also accept that the pursuit of consumerist lifestyles is the
   major contributor to ecological crisis. This article argues the
   importance in this context of recognizing the impact and longer term
   implications of some emerging forms of self-interested disaffection
   with consumerism on the part of affluent consumers themselves. For a
   small, but arguably growing number of these, consumerism is now
   compromised by its specific displeasures (stress, congestion,
   pollution, ill-health) and seen as actively pre-empting other more
   rewarding ways of living. The `alternative hedonism' implicit in these
   forms of consumer ambivalence is analysed with a view to disentangling
   its perspective from either the more didactic (and often overly
   naturalistic) conceptions of need and satisfaction offered by some
   Marxist strands of cultural theory, and from the post-modernist
   celebrations of consumer culture as a resource for the pleasures of
   fantasy, fashion and self-styling. In pressing the case for the
   development of a new `hedonist imaginary' with which to subvert current
   perceptions of the attractions of a consumerist material culture, the
   article also considers the possible contribution of cultural and

Abstract = {{Though Carolyn Merchant has agreed that Francis Bacon did not advocate
   the ``torture of nature,{''} she still maintains that ``the very

   problems of logic, context, and contrary evidence. Her particular
   insistence on the influence of the torture of witches ignores Bacon's
   skepticism about witchcraft as superstitious or imaginary. Nor do the
   writings of his successors sustain her claim that they carried forward
   his supposed program to abuse nature. We should be wary of metaphorical
   generalizations that ignore the context of the metaphor, the larger
   intent of the writers, and the fundamental limitations of such
   metaphors as descriptions of science.
   There are no scientific methods which alone lead to knowledge! We have
   to tackle things experimentally, now angry with them and now kind, and
   be successively just, passionate, and cold with them. One person
   addresses things as a policeman, a second as a father confessor, a
   third as an inquisitive wanderer. Something can be wrung from them now
   with sympathy, now with force; reverence for their secrets will take
   one person forwards, indiscretion and roguishness in revealing their
   secrets will do the same for another. We investigators are, like all

Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents an interpretation of Cornelius Castoriadis'
   ontological turn in his magnum opus, The Imaginary Institution of
   Society, as his attempt to develop a regional ontology of human
   creative institution through his elucidation of the being of the
   social-historical. It is suggested that The Imaginary Institution of
   Society can be read as four overlapping philosophical responses to the
   human condition: ontological, epistemological, anthropological and
   hermeneutical, respectively. The paper argues that Castoriadis'
   ontological turn drew on a reactivation of the ancient Greek
   problematic of nomos and physis, whereby Castoriadis saw in the order
   of nomos the key to his interpretation of the social-historical. It is
   argued moreover that despite Castoriadis' strong notion of radical
   creation as ex nihilo, he made an implicit hermeneutical turn in the
   final chapter of The Imaginary Institution of Society that opened onto
   the interpretative contexts of creation and thus relativized his idea
   of creation ex nihilo. The paper concludes with a discussion of the
   implications of nomos for creative interpretation and Castoriadis'
   radical vision of autonomy.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we wonder about the psychosocial conducts and

   project. Content analysis of their discourses demonstrates how
   cognitive, emotional, axiological, material, imaginary, symbolic
   exchanges with others from their various domains of life, condition
   strongly the entrepreneurship dynamic, making training a time-space
   period of social anchorage and validation of an individual's project.
   Those results support our questions about ``individualization{''}, a
   notion frequently presented as a privileged condition of success in the
   new contexts of professional socialization. We argue about some
   presuppositions and aims in conjunction with that notion, which could
   lead to believe that a professional project can be elaborated and
   realized alone. In counterpoint, following a lot of attainments of
   Psychology and with reference to the activities system's problematic,
   we put forward that lifelong self construction and professional
   orientation, notably during the different periods of training, imply a
   dynamic of socialization/personalization. Actually supported by their
   social environment, it means a simultaneous effort from individuals of
   integration in a multiplicity of groups and social instances, and of
   singular surpassing of contradictions in conjunction with that

Abstract = {{Objectives. To explore whether Kahneman and Tversky's (1982) simulation
   heuristic might help account for why the obsessions of people with
   obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are so compelling to them. It was
   predicted that participants would be better able to simulate a scenario
   relevant to a central OCD fear than they would scenarios related to
   other OCD and non-OCD fears and that how well participants simulated
   feared scenarios would be associated with higher ratings of subjective
   probability for that outcome and consequently greater worry.
   Design. Individuals with obsessive compulsive symptoms mentally
   simulated hypothetical scenarios so as to enable comparison of a
   personally relevant to less relevant scenarios.
   Methods. Thirty participants recruited from OCD support groups
   simulated four scenarios each and completed symptom and relevant
   construct measures.
   Results. Personally relevant scenarios were better simulated than less
   relevant scenarios. `Goodness of simulation' (GOS) was related to worry
   about the feared outcome, but this was not mediated by raised
   subjective probabilities. GOS correlated with OCD symptomatology,
   anxiety, and depression but not with cognitive variables thought to be
   related to OCD phenomenology.
   Conclusion. The overall findings converge with recent literature
   (O'Connor, 2002) emphasizing the importance of imagination and
   imaginary narratives in fuelling OCD symptoms.}},

Journal = {{CRITICAL STUDIES IN MEDIA COMMUNICATION}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{304-323}},
Abstract = {{Although studies of television in India have examined the dominant
   historicist constructions of nation in terms of the discourses of
   modernization, gender, and right-wing politics, other modes of
   imagining the nation, particularly through the interplay between
   secularism and religion, have not been analyzed. Television narratives
   are an important location for examining religion and secularism as
   embedded imaginaries, as these are enacted and performed in terms of
   stories, plots, characters, and characters' life-worlds. Pursuing this
   line of inquiry is crucial since secularism has increasingly become
   entangled with religious practices in several non-western societies.
   Indeed, all major political and religious conflicts in this part of the
   world have their beginnings in this entanglement. The social sciences
   and the humanities have ignored religion and typically perceived it as
   an impediment to modernity. However, the events of the last few years,
   especially 9/11, the subsequent global war on terror, and the rising
   violence from Darfur to Somalia, underscore the importance of engaging
   religion. Religious practices and secular principles ought to be
   brought into a productive dialogue, urgently. This study seeks to
   engage religion and secularism articulated on Indian television and
   examines instances of some dialogues that could create, in the words of
   William Connolly, an ethos of engagement.}},

Abstract = {{In the 1950s, exotica was a genre of pop music that specialized in
   depicting imaginary exotic paradises and conventionalized natives. By
   the late 1960s, exotica pop had disappeared, but its tropes of temporal
   and spatial disjuncture persisted, structuring the music, visual art,
   and social theory of the utopian counterculture. While 1950s and 1960s
   kinds of exotica differ in their preferred imaginary destinations, both
   raise the question of what intermediate shades between belief and
   disbelief are demanded by aestheticized representations of human life.
   This essay theorizes exotica as a mode of representation governed by a
   peculiar mode of reception - one of willed credulity enabled by
   submission to its spectacle. What exotica demands is what intellectuals
   are least likely to give, though, and the peculiar pleasures of exotica
   spectacle are denigrated or rendered invisible in the hermeneutic

   acknowledging that it is extremely hard to give an argument that
   establishes its validity in a compelling way. By contrasting the
   history of science with that of geographic discoveries and the
   difficulties faced by any inevitabilist account of the former, I
   consider three different characterizations of the success of science,
   truth, adequacy to the phenomena, and robust fit, and analyze their
   consequences for the meaning and plausibility of contingentism. I
   retain the third characterization of scientific success and argue that
   the role played by creativity in scientific activities and the fact
   that there is a multiplicity of paths that researchers can legitimately
   follow in order to obtain a robust fit jointly support a qualified

Abstract = {{The emerging contours of global philosophy are being shaped by
   worldwide exchanges, diverse methods and approaches, the diminution of
   cultural hegemony, and expanded access to philosophical discussion. But
   globally intentioned scholars whose formative intellectual preparation
   is Anglo-European may be unaware of the role played by the imaginary in
   suppressing ideas and values that differ from one's root tradition.
   This essay uses a model of the Western philosophical imaginary taken
   from French researcher Michele Le Doeuff, and draws connections between
   Le Doeuff's attempts to expose and interrupt the Western imaginary and
   the efforts of philosophers who wish to cross geographical and cultural
   boundaries. It is argued that Le Doeuff's critical approach has much to
   offer those who wish to cultivate a more receptive and supple
   philosophical sensibility - a global sensibility - and that this
   approach can be complemented by a horizontal practice adapted from
   Mahayana Buddhist sources. The purpose of this essay is to promote
   continuing dialogue about how best to realize the promise of
   globalization in philosophical practice.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores what is meant by `being European' in contemporary
   Bosnia. Over the past two decades, Western politicians have justified
   interventions in Bosnia through recourse to an Orientalist binary
   between a rational and progressive `Europe, and an irrational and
   retrogressive `Balkans'. Current efforts to incorporate Bosnia into
   European structures reproduce this imaginary, in this instance though
   replacing space with time, suggesting that Bosnia needs to move from a
   `Balkan' past to a `European' future. In this paper I explore the
   political effects of such imaginaries through two levels of analysis.
   In the first, I critically examine the ongoing implications of the
   geopolitical framing of Bosnia as Europe's `Other'. In the second, I
   explore how nationalist politicians have deployed European rhetoric in
   order to stake claims to resources and establish respect. I conclude by
   arguing that a sovereignty paradox underpins both `geopolitical' and
   `nationalist' European rubrics in Bosnia: while idealising forms of
   solidarity based on broad social and cultural affiliations, such
   discourses simultaneously seek to promote the state as the primary
   territorialisation of political life.}},

   motifs, it was inspired by the legend of Alpaida, mother of Charles

   this latter relationship, one should note the etymological identity,

Pages = {{14-17}},
Abstract = {{Musba is a work that takes the form of a museum without architecture,
   upheld on the idea of the museum as a zone of contact and exchange.
   Each of the actions of Musba construct an imaginary space that projects
   the basic functions of a museum towards a neighborhood, opening up a
   space to collective participation. What is exhibited is the process
   that corresponds to the stage of formation of a collection, setting
   selection and classification criteria of what is found during a long
   gathering period (2005-2006) carried out in the proximity of two
   museums in western Santiago: Museo de la Solidaridad Salvador Allende
   (MSA) and Museo de Arte Contemporaneo (MAC) in Quinta Normal.
   From the intimacy of the inhabitants of a neighborhood, Musba collects
   the most prized objects to make a photographic record, registering
   images and accounts in a digital archive that will be the first sample
   of the collection, making reference to the foundational stage of the
   MSA.
   The multiplicity of views on the function of a museum corresponds to
   the integration of the neighbors as co-participants in the process to
   construct a memory. The exhibition device of this collection is also
   intended to multiply the axes of understanding in an archive that is
   open to other possible combinations. The flow of an infinity of
   details, presented up in six projections, is the result of an animated
   succession of photographic flames. There, each fragment is randomly
   contaminated in the simultaneousness of the projections, making visible
   what Walter Benjamin called ``the optical unconscious{''} giving rise
   to a landscape of nostalgia.}},

   the Lacanian model of imaginary-Symbolic-real, Henzes texts from from
   the 1950s are read in a way in which the aesthetics ``of a free, wild
   sound{''} is linked to the requirement of music being communicative.
   Musical communication is understood thereby differently as in the
   later, politically engaged phase of Henze. It is still understood as an
   excessive moment of the conventional auditive signs, in which listener
   dissolves the traditionally fixed senses. With Lacan, this situation of
   hearing may be described as a musical representation of the `I', which
   is fundamentally more unstable than linguistic self-representations,
   leading consequently toward an enjoyment as a condition of temporary

Abstract = {{This article introduces four studies inspired by the theory of the

   concerned relationships among role-playing game (RPG) players, and
   their heroes. The outcomes showed that, if the confrontation with the
   RPG hero was taken up, it typically led to a new insight concerning
   mutual connections between the player's usual self and the self of his
   or her hero, with a simultaneous experience of autonomy and success.
   Studies 3 and 4 focused on the relationships between internal
   dialogical activity and personality traits measured by the NEO-PI-R by
   Costa and McCrae (1992). In Study 3 the respondents having imaginary
   dialogues scored lower on Assertiveness and higher on
   Self-Consciousness, Fantasy, Aesthetics, Feelings and Openness than
   those having monologues. In Study 4 the Dialogical Activity Scale (DAS)
   corresponded with Openness and Neuroticism, and four facets:

Abstract = {{This paper argues that there is an immanent and evolving relationship
   between the prevailing form of taxation and the economic geographies of
   the state. Despite this, the geographic significance of taxation has
   been obscured by the language in which its historic transformation
   tends to be couched. Prevailing fiscal systems tend to be presented as
   essentially static - institutionally and spatially fixed and routinely
   inscribed within the fixed boundaries and territories of the
   `sovereign' fiscal state. Any threat to, or change in the nature or
   geography of the fiscal state tends to be couched in terms of `crisis'
   - of negative and discontinuous change. This paper contends that these
   related and essentially conservative discourses of fiscal geography
   mask the degree to which fiscal spaces are both multiple and
   continuously evolving. More importantly, it argues, this fluidity and
   multiplicity does not threaten the stability and viability of state
   form, but it is an essential process in its maintenance and
   reproduction. Running counter to the prevailing discourse of the
   `national economy', the practice of fiscal geography is an
   under-analysed but key aspect of the historical evolution and

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1155-1169}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the implications of making the cultural turn in
   the engagement of economic and political geography with issues of
   political economy. It seeks to steer a path between a fetishistic,
   reified economics that naturalizes economic categories and a soft
   economic sociology that focuses on the similarities between economic
   and other socio-cultural activities at the expense of the specificity
   of the economic. We show how combining critical semiotic analysis with
   an evolutionary and institutional approach to political economy offers
   one interesting way to achieve this goal. An evolutionary and
   institutional approach to semiosis enables us to recognize the semiotic
   dimensions of political economy at the same time as establishing how
   and why only some economic imaginaries among the many that circulate
   actually come to be selected and institutionalized; and Marxian
   political economy enables us to identify the contradictions and
   conflicts that make capital accumulation inherently improbable and
   crisis-prone, creating the space for economic imaginaries to play a
   role in stabilizing accumulation in specific spatio-temporal fixes
   and/or pointing the way forward from recurrent crises. The paper
   illustrates these arguments with a case study on the Flemish `anchoring
   strategy' as a specific regional economic development strategy. It
   concludes with a set of guidelines for the further development of
   cultural political economy. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This case study addresses daily practices and social imaginary (set of
   values, institutions, laws and symbols common to a group) in the
   litoral society of the western sector of the Isla Grande of Chiloe

   and environment. The central objective of this investigation is to
   describe and categorize daily practices, of art economic nature, taken
   on by the inhabitants of the sector of Cucao, in Chiloe, together with
   the social uses of time associated with these practices. The
   inhabitants of this sector are active in primary production linked to
   agriculture, fishing, and crustacean extraction, and the use and
   management of the forest. Starting from this, the modes of life and
   imaginaries in a society in transition toward modernity are enunciated.}},

Abstract = {{This essay discusses Ovid's poetic rendition of Hellenistic astronomy
   in the Phaethon myth. In Met. 2.63-75 Sol presents his diurnal and
   annual movements as separate, but the first instruction (127-8) to his

   epsilon iota psi iota sigma-theory; so far Ovid has followed Geminus
   Isag. 12. Met. 2.129-33 telescopes the Milky Way (via quinque per
   arcus) and the ecliptic together, the sectus in obliquum limes
   zonarumque trium contentus fine reflecting the Aratean system of three
   imaginary circles connected by means of the fourth (Phaen. 526 o delta
   epsilon tau epsilon tau rho alpha tau o sigma) circle, the ecliptic;

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{429-440}},
Abstract = {{The paper develops the thesis that interpersonal relations and
   communication relationships are of key importance in constituting the
   self. The author interprets the thesis that the self is not only who we
   are and what we feel and believe to be, but is also an object that is
   developed, formed, presented and modified in interpersonal
   communication. Currently, due to our involvement in an ever growing
   number of communication situations and relations the self is growing
   increasingly complex. The paper opens with a presentation of the
   radical conceptual shift from the conception of self in that part of
   the western philosophical tradition which understood the self as a
   superior, idealised and abstract platform to the ``social{''} self,
   integrated in the everyday world of communication and relationships.
   This shift was first made successfully only by the early pragmatists
   William James, Charles Horton Cooley, and especially George Herbert
   Mead, so their contributions to the conceptualisation of self, Mead's
   in particular, are treated in more detail. Given that some authors of
   the Russian cultural-historical school (M. Bakhtin, L. Vygotsky) also
   contributed importantly to the turnabout from the premise of the self
   as the centre of the social world to the premise of relationships and
   relations being the basic realities of which the self is merely one of
   the constituting parts, the paper also relies on their key emphases in
   developing the thesis of the ``communicative{''} self. The conclusions
   of early theoreticians are updated with recent findings from the fields
   of brain research and developmental psychology to make them more
   topical. The consideration of early social-communication conceptions of
   the self as well as the recent findings of neurosciences and
   developmental psychology leads to the conclusion that the self is on
   the one hand embodied one aspect of the self is the current
   emotional-affective perception of oneself or the temporary experiential
   state whereas on the other hand, that other, more permanent and
   essential aspect of the self is formed under the influence of social
   and communication processes. Conceptually, the author thus
   distinguishes between two aspects of the self. The first aspect is
   embodied, actional; it is about the will to act or the perception of
   the power of action. It comprises the creative, spontaneous part of the
   self, but also the point of view from which the individual perceives
   the world. Even this aspect of the self is to a certain degree a social
   formation, as it is shaped even in the earliest phase through
   communication/interaction. The other aspect is reflexive. It is
   entirely dependent on historical time, modes of communication,
   relationships, discourse practices and other social activities.
   Reflexiveness in this sense means that the self can make itself into an
   object and is thus object and subject at the same time. The individual
   cognitive-affective perception of oneself cannot be achieved through
   direct observation, rather always indirectly, through the communication
   with generalised, concrete and imaginary others.}},

Abstract = {{Burkinabe masks are a language that is a priori esoteric because of

   an elite who only have access to it through secret instruction
   (esoterism) and who possess the explanatory myths and techniques of
   fabrication. Secondly, masks have a socio-religious function, which is
   community based and popular, i.e. open to common knowledge (exoterism):
   they express the fundamental beliefs, prayers of expiation, requests
   for prosperity and peace of the whole community. This is said to
   everyone. Many signs used in the appearances of masks belong moreover

   character,{''} appropriate the authorial voice (and its attendant
   authority) and add their own subjectivities. Based on the mirroring
   that occurs between the narrator and the narrating characters, we

   This is a typical case and is studied mainly to provide understanding
   to the issue. The data were collected from interviews with the boy, his
   mother and his teacher. Data were also collected through observations
   and a self-report assessment instrument called Kid Play Profile. The
   results showed that the boy was ridiculed by his peers and that at
   times he felt excluded from them, which prevented him from
   participating in play activities. The boy's experience came from
   different perceived problems such as lack of friends to play with, his
   inability to know how to perform in different play activities, and lack
   of proper support and encouragement from adults. Supporting children to
   overcome social skills deficits could prevent them from being teased
   and may have a positive effect on health. To optimize children's

Abstract = {{In an article on Orientalism and musical style, Derek B. Scott posits a
   near-exhaustive list of musical characteristics that act as Orientalist
   signifiers. Measures 85-88 in the development section of the first
   movement of Haydn's ``Fifths{''} Quartet contain eight of them:
   augmented seconds, sliding or sinuous chromaticism, Phrygian mode,
   repetitive rhythms, a repetitive small-compass melody, arabesque,
   parallel movement in fifths, and ostinato. It is difficult to imagine
   that this passage could have contained any more Orientalist signifiers
   and still have made sense as Western art music at the twilight of the
   eighteenth century. If Haydn's string quartets are like four civilized
   persons holding a conversation, then at this point the interlocutors
   are speaking a foreign tongue, and that foreign tongue could be Ottoman
   Turkish. For centuries, the Turks had dwelled in the imaginary world of
   European exoticism as denizens of a mysterious East as close in
   geography as it was remote in custom. They were typically represented
   as either sensual, inviting, and voluptuous (their feminine
   manifestation), or inexplicably menacing or dangerous (the masculine
   manifestation).
   This article draws from musicology, cultural and literary theory, and
   psychoanalysis as well as my own analysis in order to help explain the
   impact of music that is overtly Orientalist, intended as a foil to the
   rest of the movement. I present this music as a hermeneutic window
   opening up to broader issues of meaning, and I discuss the implications
   of such signification in the construction of Western identity.}},

Abstract = {{This article critically discusses the permanent celebration and
   `omnipresence' of the memory of the transition to democracy in Spain,
   or its power as a referent which makes sense of the present, helps to
   overcome periods of crisis, and legitimizes policies. It argues that
   its institution and power as well as the issue of memory and
   commemorations need to be rethought. Drawing on Laclau and Mouffe's
   discourse theory, they are reconceptualized as `re-membering' and the
   transition is accounted for as an `imaginary'. Its power is also
   illustrated by the fact that the projects which directly challenge it
   as the sole legitimate framework for the construction of democracy are
   criticized for threatening democracy itself. Two such projects are on
   the one hand the initiatives for the `recovery' of the memories of the
   Civil War and Franco's dictatorship, and on the other the claim for
   increased regional autonomy. They are called `second transitions'. The

Abstract = {{I discuss how the rhetoric of illness functions in Annette Kolb's novel
   Das Exemplar. Even though the illness of the protagonist's friend makes
   the linguistic expression of pain and fear difficult the novel develops
   alternative modes of expression. First of all, it evokes nationalist
   and psychoanalyst discourses trying to pin down another person's
   behaviour and thinking but neglecting the human. Because these
   discourses are incapable of rendering the Other a crisis situation with
   socio-political implications can be detected. Secondly, self-reflexive
   strategies such as silence, expressions with double meanings (discourse
   level) as well as doubly motivated images and silent characters (level
   of imaginary reality) circumvent discourse and add to our knowledge of
   the imaginary story world. Closely connected to the questionability of
   identification is the role of the body. The body remains mysteriously
   hidden behind the novel's many personifications and comparisons. This
   effect is intensified by the illness of malaria that abruptly changes
   the patient's body. Still, the feelings and hope shared by the two
   protagonists turn out to be as open to interpretation as silence, as
   flexible as enduring love and as vulnerable to new circumstances as to
   malaria. These parallels uncover the text's rhetorical structure.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of Western geographical knowledge played a key role in

   in order to represent the expanded understanding of geography as
   galvanized by the East's encounter with Western geographical knowledge,
   these maps depended on the East's traditional conception of the world
   in terms of content and style. Based on Shanhaijing (The Classic of
   Mountains and Seas), which described the imaginary world beyond human
   experience, mapmakers established the structure of the four separate
   parts of the world-internal continent, internal sea, external
   continent, and external sea-and created place names in each area: names
   recorded in historical documents are included in the internal
   continent, and place names related to Taoist immortality (sinseon
   sasang) in the internal sea. The understanding of the world implied in
   circular world maps still remains within the Sinocentric worldview and
   the concept of cheonwon jibang, which defines the heavens as round and
   the earth as square. In addition, the maps reflect the cosmographical
   concept of ``unity of heaven, earth, and man{''} and the Taoist idea of
   immortality rooted in the desire for health and longevity.}},

Abstract = {{In the nineteenth century France, printed material was illustrated more
   and more with engravings depicting letters and various practices
   involving letter writing. Starting with a large set of these kinds of

   genre as feminine was treated. Two sources are explored: letter writing
   manuals and the engravings in the popular press. In the manuals
   (1830-1900), the educational project imposed the type of a
   ``serious{''} writer, mostly a man represented in a convenient position
   and surrounded with functional tools, Nevertheless a few love scenes
   could appear as clear warnings against disorder and transgression. In
   the lithographies published by Gavarni in 1837-1839 and titled La Boite
   aux lettres (the letter box), the double image, a copy of an actual
   text linked to a pleasant scene, made a mockery of the social life of
   the time through various social types (the poor student the unskilled
   painter, the lost tourist, the tricky servant and so on). Relationships
   based on seduction, duplicity, or ridicule were also made fun of
   According to these representations, the women were not only placed on
   the fringes of the written culture but also in the core of the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MUSICOLOGICAL RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{113-133}},
Abstract = {{Noir fictions tend to a binary form of representation in which society
   is shown divided into light and dark sides, with the latter casting its
   shadows onto the former. Key to this discussion is Irving Howe's notion
   of the city as a narrative device for representing society in all its
   contradictions and fractures. In film noir, the abstract notion of
   ``society{''} is transformed into a concrete spatial schema: the Naked
   City, a ground where dispossessed groups congregate and interact with
   ``straight{''} society. The city becomes a locus for (and geographic
   metaphor of) the idea of a fallen world hidden just behind the faade of
   bland social harmony. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the music
   written for films that explore this trope of representation was often a
   cinematic version of jazz. More exactly, it is music that attempts to
   conjure filmic images of the urban demimonde associated with jazz and
   the narrative subject that traverses it. In its traffic in filmic
   image, cinematic jazz resembles exotica, a kind of pop music that
   deploys a code of standardized musical gestures to evoke imaginary
   exotic paradises. But jazz exotica replaces jungle settings with images
   of the ``Naked City,{''} which narrate motion across the borders
   separating the light and dark sides of film noir's divided America.}},

Abstract = {{This paper looks at how the city of Hyderabad, the capital of the south
   Indian state of Andhra Pradesh and production centre of the Telugu film
   industry, has been represented in recent popular cinema. It outlines
   the history of a new mode of representing the city in Telugu cinema and
   argues that its significance lies in the tendency to delocalize the
   city. Criminalization of the city's older inhabitants, who are marked
   by either religion (Islam) or their `non-standard' dialect of Telugu,
   often accompanies this move. In the process, any claims that they might
   have on the city are delegitimized. Okkadu, a major commercial hit,
   restaged the country versus city dichotomy and the antagonisms
   complicated by cultural and political tensions between the three
   constituent regions of Andhra Pradesh. This film follows the late 1990s
   trend in the film industry to recreate entire cityscapes within the
   Studio, ensuring that location shooting in busy city streets and
   neighbourhoods merely returns us to the grandeur of lavish and
   `realistic' studio sets. It reconstructs Hyderabad's most recognizable
   monument, the 400-year-old Charminar, in addition to its obviously
   imaginary residential neighbourhood. This paper looks at how and why

   subsequently provided with an additional 4 min free play

   was exhibited after modelling than before. Furthermore, in the
   post-modelling phase, children were as likely to generate their own
   novel pretence as they were to copy the actions demonstrated by the
   experimenter. They also increased the number of novel symbolic acts
   involving imaginary play from the pre- to the post-modelling phase.

   the films. He shows how Gopalakrishnan's protagonists are men and women
   who have been physically and psychically displaced from mainstream
   society. Victims of choice and circumstance, they grapple with forces
   that are self-generated but more often than not unleashed by larger
   historical and social processes. He particularly focuses on the work of
   the eighties because it is here that Gopalakrishnan attempts to locate
   otherness within the interior workings of self, within a psychological
   space that is often associated with the creative process. The male
   protagonists in these films function in very different contexts and yet
   their status as outsiders is defined by their engagement with the
   imaginary which they achieve through their creativity.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores Walter Benjamin's famous concept of the aura in
   relation to his writings on photography. Although Benjamin's
   ``Artwork{''} essay charges photography with the decline of the aura of
   the traditional artwork, his essay on photography complicates this
   historical narrative, associating aura with early portrait photography
   but also with its successor, the commercial studio portrait. The
   childhood photograph of Franz Kafka, whose melancholy air serves
   Benjamin as an example of a paradoxical, post-auratic aura, recurs in
   his childhood memoirs, where the narrator projects himself into this
   picture. Benjamin's writings on photography thus develop an alternative
   concept of aura, one which transcends fixed historical or technological
   categories through the model of an imaginary encounter between viewer
   and image. This conception has far-reaching consequences not only for
   the theory of photography but also for its role within literature, as
   is suggested by Benjamin's empathetic engagement with the Kafka
   photograph and its incorporation into his own life story.}},

   subjected to certain mechanisms of construction and interpretation of

   pre-moulded memories, in which certain specific visual features become
   manifest in order to organize the difference and, thus, the ways of
   `imaginaryzing' them. Photography can be thought of as a cultural
   production where the social or collective memory looks for referents,

Abstract = {{This article critically evaluates bettering human life. Because this

   eugenics and enhancement through the social prism of `the imaginary'
   (defined `as a set of assumptions and concepts for thinking and
   speaking about human enhancement and its future direction') {[}1].
   ``Exploring basic assumptions underlying the idea of human
   enhancement'' investigates underlying assumptions and claims for human
   enhancement. Firstly, human eugenics and enhancement entangles a
   factual as well as a normative claim about what improvement/betterment
   maybe constitutive of. Secondly, claims about what a better life is, is
   often a future orientated claim about whether certain kinds of life
   that do not exist yet should ever exist. Moral images of thought are
   introduced and how they work to make normative judgments about lives
   that do not exist. This implicates the moral problem of difference,
   where an image of a `better' life-classically expressed in eugenics as
   a `superior' and/or `normal' life-necessarily entails inferiority
   and/or deviance from a norm. ``Moral imagination in contemporary
   fiction and the history of old eugenics'', introduces moral images in
   history of eugenics and demonstrates how examples fall foul of the
   problem. ``The new (liberal) eugenics and the moral image of therapy''
   examines progress in contemporary debates, the move from authoritarian
   to non-authoritarian eugenics (human enhancement), and how, to some
   extent, this has solved the problem of difference, through liberal
   defence of personal choice. ``The heart of the eugenic issue'' suggests
   that personal choice in liberal non-authoritarian eugenics is not
   immune to basic drive behind all eugenic arguments; desire as lack
   which is expressed as the continual dissatisfaction of not having our
   future expectations met.}},

Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{29-31}},

Month = {{MAR-SEP}},
Abstract = {{Hugo Haring was a member of the generation of architects that gave
   birth to Modern Architecture at the beginning of the 20th century. The
   innovative drive of many of these artists had already found expression
   in the extraordinary atmosphere of prewar expressionism. While before
   the conflict their ideas were confined largely to a utopian plane,
   after it they found themselves having to deal with reality and with a
   sociopolitical context sorely tested by the aftermath of the war. Now
   these ``imaginary architects{''} pursued a concrete objective:
   reconstruction and the construction of a new society to be created
   through an alliance between artists and the community united in
   associations that were intended to act like true confraternities or
   lodges. In 1923 a group of architects began to meet in the Berlin
   studio of Mies van der Rohe to discuss the Neues Bauen ({''}New
   Building{''}) and the obstacles that governments were putting in the
   way of its realization. Among them were Otto Bartning, Peter Behrens,
   Hugo Haring, Erich Mendelsohn, Mies van der Rohe, Hans Poelzig and the
   Taut brothers. This marked the birth of the Zehnerring ({''}Ring of
   Ten{''}). Hugo Haring made himself the group's spokesman and became its
   secretary when, in 1926, it was expanded to include twenty-seven
   architects from all over Germany. The new Ring declared itself an
   association with a Logencharakter ({''}the character of a Masonic
   Lodge{''}). In this way it fell into line with the organizations that
   had been set up earlier in the cultural climate of expressionism. The
   Ring represented the latest development in this tendency.
   Ever since his first essay, Wege zur Form (1925), Haring had defined
   his theories of architecture in contraposition to those of Le
   Corbusier. Haring saw the Neues. Bauen as an organic approach to
   construction, i.e. one that started from the inside and went on to
   express itself on the outside, echoing the natural processes of the
   manifestation of form. The activity of the architect was understood as
   a maieutic operation aimed at setting free the form inherent in the
   nature of the project and dictated by the conditions imposed by the
   site and the task it had to fulfill. In his view Le Corbusier embodied
   geometry - as opposed to organic construction, latinity - as opposed to
   nordic culture, classicism - as opposed to gothic culture; he
   symbolized Architektur, whereas Haring represented Bauen. The first
   encounter between Haring and Le Corbusier took place on the occasion of
   the CIAM (International Congress of Modern Architecture) held at La
   Sarraz in 1928. Le Corbusier and Giedion had taken over the reins of
   the Congress from the moment of its conception and taken care to steer
   it in the direction they wanted, excluding any possible interference
   from outside, and in particular from the Ring, which as the only
   ``strong{''} group of avant-garde architects in Europe - would have
   been able to challenge their leadership. The two met at the time of the
   setback suffered by the Franco-Swiss architect in the competition held
   by the League of Nations in 1926 for the design of its headquarters in
   Geneva. Giedion took his side in the debates that surrounded the
   competition. A Congress of Modern Architecture would have been the
   ideal means of legitimizing Le Corbusier's work at an international
   level, after his principles and his reputation had been brought into
   question by the outcome of the Geneva competition, and of forging a
   direct link with the authorities that would have allowed him to obtain
   public commissions of greater prestige.
   Right from the preparatory phase of the Congress Haring had found
   himself at loggerheads with Le Corbusier, who had drawn up a program
   and a list of guests that left no room for debate: from the very
   beginning the assembly presented his conclusions as definitive. Le
   Corbusier's aim was simply to demonstrate to public opinion that modern
   architects were united and had formed a common front in defense of the
   new architecture - his architecture - whose fundamental principles were
   to be laid down in the ``Declaration of La Sarraz,{''} signed and
   approved by the Congress at its end. Given the combative attitude
   displayed by Haring, even though he had in the end agreed to sign the
   ``Declaration,{''} Le Corbusier and Giedion felt that is was necessary
   to expel him from the CIAM, preferring Gropius, who in turn showed
   himself ready to cooperate with the two men and, despite initial
   hesitation, dumped the Ring,following in the footsteps of Mies, who had
   left the organization in 1927. After the second CIAM, held in Frankfurt
   in 1929, Haring was demoted from main to deputy representative of
   Germany and in 1930 was definitively excluded: Gropius and Breuer were
   nominated as delegates.
   A long time afterward, when the conditions that had given rise to the
   disputes recounted here no longer held true, the opposite poles of the
   controversy, apparently so clear cut and immovable, blurred their
   outlines. When the now ailing Haring was shown photographs of the
   Ronchamp Chapel, he said with a smile that Le Corbusier had at last
   proved him right, that it was an authentic expression of the Neues
   Bauen he had so strenuously championed.}},

Abstract = {{Food constitutes the central trope of place-making of Bangladesh in
   West Bengal, through various metaphors of excess and lack. South Asian
   ethnographies on food have focussed primarily on the cosmological and
   symbolic characteristics of `Hindu' (read South Asian) food, which
   appear as bounded experiences. Rather than focusing on `Hindu' or
   `South Asian' food, this article explores the vegetarian/non-vegetarian
   culinary boundaries and permeations that lie at the interface of
   Bengali Hindu and Bengali Muslim food practices in two very different
   social contexts - middle-class and lower middle-class urban Dhaka and
   the well-off and poor in the village of Enayetpur. Through this
   analysis, it seeks to show how different nationalities (read here
   Indian Bengalis and Bangladeshi Bengalis) are connected or estranged by
   the foods they consume or refuse to consume, and how culinary
   boundaries and connections constitute political identities between
   nation-states that become visible through the food practices of the
   ethnographer (which in turn become markers of political borders,
   territoriality and place-making). The troping of `place' via food
   allows the imaginaries and ambivalences of Bangladesh and West Bengal
   towards each other to be highlighted. We shall see that in this context
   food actually emerges as a mnemonic, capable of mobilising emotions
   relating to the ravages of the war of 1971 and the irreconcilable,
   divided past of the two Bengals.}},

   producing and maintaining a coherent and cohesive identity. This notion
   of identity is explored through the transmutations of the masculine

   twinned entities; their physical sameness is a product and symbol of
   the miraculous and the divine, and marker of their state of grace. This
   symbolic twinship, its dissolution, and its renewal becomes the focus
   for a narrative play between difference and sameness that patterns the

   articulate her otherness. Undine is a speaking and desiring subject at
   the same time as she remains an object of projection. The article
   compares Bachmann's short story with Irigaray's extensive philosophical
   and feminist project, showing the many ways in which `Undine geht'
   anticipates (and is ultimately more successful than) Irigaray's concept
   of `woman' and her mimetic strategy. Bachmann's Undine subversively
   mimes what she represents; she both incarnates and eludes her
   representation as man's imaginary other. While `Undine geht' appears to
   provide an alternative conception of female subjectivity or to
   articulate repressed female desire, it ultimately explores the radical
   complexity of these concepts.
   Bachmann's short story illustrates, moreover, the salience of
   Irigaray's attempt to examine the way in which language constructs and
   reproduces sexual difference. `Undine geht' goes further, however, by
   also exploring the constitutive role of narrative and culture in
   subjectivity. The text is less an account of a female figure who finds
   her voice than of the difficulty and impediments to so doing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a longitudinal study of an Enterprise System (ES)
   implementation by critically examining the discursive context in which
   an ES implementation unfolds. The findings show that users strongly
   supported the ES in the earlier stage of implementation when the
   technology was an imaginary phenomenon. However, in later stages, when
   the technology is in use, user support was not consistent. In this
   phase, the ES produces loss of control and an inability to function as
   an arbiter of fairness (in allocating resources associated with the
   system), thereby directly challenging existing professional identities
   and roles. These outcomes, in turn, generate acts of resistance on the
   part of workers. Users reach inside the technology and reshape it by
   devising creative workarounds that produce a sense of reskilling to
   counter the deskilling produced by the loss of control and power. The
   analysis also shows that an ES is a complex social phenomenon that is
   intricately linked to and complicit in shaping organizational structure
   and identity. In particular, this study shows how technology, structure

   the merger of philosophy and literature. The movement, which was

   specific forms of alienation it embodies also suggest the
   ``victimized{''} white male of the conservative right. At the same

   psychiatric medications, seclusion and restraint, and electroconvulsive
   therapy (ECT). A vignette was used to determine preferences first with
   respect to an imaginary patient and then with respect to the

Abstract = {{We have no interest whatever in minimizing the continuing history of
   racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise abusive biologisms, or the
   urgency of their exposure, that has made the gravamen of so many
   contemporary projects of critique. At the same time, we fear - with
   installation of an automatic antibiologism as the unshifting tenet of
   `theory' - the loss of conceptual access to an entire thought-realm.
   (Sedgwick and Frank, 1995: 15)
   I was left wondering what danger had been averted by the exclusion of
   biology. What does the nominative `biological or anatomical body'
   actually refer to? And what secures the separation of its inadmissible
   matter from the proper purview of Irigaray's textual interventions?
   When I asked a question to this effect it was met with a certain
   nervous comprehension. Deciding, perhaps, that I must still be immersed
   in a precritical understanding of the body, the speaker dismissed me
   with a revealing theatrical gesture. As if to emphasize the sheer
   absurdity of my question she pinched herself and commented `Well I
   don't mean this body'. And so it seemed with a gesture so matter of
   fact that it required no further comment, the fact of (the) matter was
   both decided and dispatched. (Kirby, 1997: 70)
   Feminism has been as deeply implicated in routinized antiessentialism
   as any of our critical procedures. Even though questions of `the body'
   have become increasingly fashionable in all manner of feminist projects
   (surely `the body' has become, in a very short space of time, one of
   our most routinized theoretical gestures), the schedule of feminism's
   antibiologism has been little altered. In most of these projects on
   `the body', the body in question is pursued in its socially,
   experientially, or psychically constituted forms, but rarely in its
   physiologically, biochemically, or microbiologically constituted form,
   the idea of biological construction having been rendered either
   unintelligible or naive. Despite an avowed interest in the body, there
   is a persistent distaste for biological detail. (Wilson, 1998: 14-15)
   These feminist theories have usually been reluctant to engage with
   biological data: they retain, and encourage, the fierce antibiologism
   that marked the emergence of second wave feminism. (Wilson, 2004: 13)
   That feminist scholars are particularly prone to a `knee jerk
   constructivism' helps explain the reluctance of those in the humanities
   to engage seriously with the claims of science. (Squier, 2004: 46)
   This book functions primarily as a reminder to social, political, and
   cultural theorists, particularly those interested in feminism,
   antiracism and questions of the politics of globalisation, that they
   have forgotten a crucial dimension of research, if not necessary to,
   then certainly useful for more incisively formulating the concepts on
   which they so heavily, if implicitly rely. It is written as a
   remembrance of what we have forgotten-not just the body, but that which
   makes it possible and which limits its actions: the precarious,
   accidental, contingent, expedient, striving, dynamic status of life in
   a messy, complicated, resistant, brute world of materiality, a world
   regulated by the exigencies, the forces, of space and time. We have
   forgotten the nature, the ontology, of the body, the conditions under
   which bodies are encultured, psychologized, given identity, historical
   location, and agency. We have forgotten where we come from. (Grosz,
   2004a: 2).}},

   relationships of the characters, drawing them closer. Finally, the

   Albertine disparue (The Fugitive)-who is pleased to have his article
