J	Wycisk, Jowita; Kleka, Pawel								Future psychologists' attitudes toward lesbians raising children together in the situation of child focused intervention								PSYCHIATRIA POLSKA				48	4			727	738					2014	2014	Objectives: The aim of paper was to explore the attitudes of Polish psychology students towards lesbian mothers whose children undergo psychological intervention, in an imaginary situation of providing professional support to the child. The authors found 3 types of psychologist behaviour: contact omission (withdrawal from the intervention, mother's partner exclusion), apparent appreciation of mother's partner and authentic appreciation of mother's partner (with women comparable participation). The authors explored an interaction between these attitudes and the support for gay and lesbian rights, the origin of the child (from a previous heterosexual relationship or present, homosexual one) and demographic variables.Methods: 97 students of psychology were examined at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, using the custom survey.Results: Respondents were most likely to include mother's partner to intervention, and the least - to avoid contact. Based on cluster analysis we found three types of attitude: unconditional acceptance, conditional acceptance, dependent on whether the child was born due in heterosexual or lesbian relationship and avoidance / rejection. The attitude of participants was associated with the declared support for gay rights, there was no correlation with gender and age.Conclusions: Due to the significant level of social prejudice against gays and lesbians in Poland, the issue of homosexual parenting and social functioning of gay and lesbians' children should become an area of research and scientific debate. There is a necessity of the introduction of this issue to the curricula of higher education and the implementation of formal, systematic training on sexual diversity for the professionals supporting families.									0	0	0	0	0	0033-2674		WOS:000345206500008	25314800	
J	Rogers, Douglas								Petrobarter Oil, Inequality, and the Political Imagination in and after the Cold War								CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY				55	2			131	153		10.1086/675498			APR 1 2014	2014	Petrobarterthe exchange of oil for goods and services without reference to monetary currencyhas been a widespread and underappreciated practice among corporations, states, and state agencies over the past half century. Analyzing this practice with reference to anthropological theories of barter adds to our understandings of two significant and intertwined concerns in contemporary social science: (1) the production and reproduction of inequality at various scales, from subnational regions to the international system as a whole, and (2) the generation and fate of mobilizing political imaginaries that challenge the abstracted, universalizing imaginaries so often associated with monetized exchange, especially in capitalist contexts. Barter exchanges featuring oil are, therefore, as analytically significant as the much more commonly studied transactions of oil and money. Ethnographic and historical case studies of petrobarter are drawn from the Perm region of the Russian Urals in the post-Soviet period and the global oil trade in the early Cold War. This view from the perspective of the socialist and postsocialist world, it is argued, provides an instructive counterpoint to the many existing studies of oil and money, both in and beyond anthropology, that are situated in the European-American colonial and postcolonial periphery.									2	0	0	0	2	0011-3204		WOS:000333463700001	24991673

J	Fang Xingfu								The Filtered Clones: An Analysts of the Character and Fate of the Clones in Never Let Me Go								FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES				36	2			104	111					APR 2014	2014	Kazuo Ishiguro's novel Never Let Me Go has gained popularity among critics since its first publication in 2005. It is questioned as well by some critics because of the characters' lack of rebellious consciousness in the novel. The theory of social character and social unconscious put forward by Erich Fromm can meet the need to find a new answer to the question: For the sake of their own purpose, human beings shape in the process of socialization, with the help of social filter consisting of language, logic and social taboos, the clones living in the techno-space, which leads to clones' obedience to "donating" their key body organs and their tortured miserable fate arranged by human.									0	0	0	0	0	1003-7519		WOS:000336881900014		
J	Caglioti, Daniela L.								Why and How Italy Invented an Enemy Aliens Problem in the First World War								WAR IN HISTORY				21	2			142	169		10.1177/0968344513498038			APR 2014	2014	The article addresses the question of why, during the First World War, the Italian government and nationalist public opinion conformed to other European countries' campaigns against enemy aliens in spite of the problem's very minor dimension. After analysing the shift from Germanophilia to Germanophobia, it explores the policies targeting civilians of enemy nationality (mainly Austro-Hungarians and Germans), and assesses their implementation. By using statistical data on the presence of aliens in Italy, official documents, and the nationalist press, it shows that Italy waged a twofold campaign against an often imaginary enemy. The first was conducted mainly by nationalists and resulted in press campaigns, rumours, and brief eruptions of violence against alien targets. The second was conducted through decrees, administrative provisions, police activity, and military orders intended to affect personal freedom and property rights. The article inserts the Italian case into a broader European comparative framework.									1	0	0	0	1	0968-3445		WOS:000337287100001

Al contrario, como en el mito cosmogónico tehuelche de Kooch -que opera como subtexto del poemario-, de la tristeza originaria por la soledad y la tiniebla envolvente emerge al fin el mundo de la vida con sus luces y sombras.								0	0	0	0	0	0718-2295		SCIELO:S0718-22952014000100008

The persisting traces of Nyerere and Ujamaa are not so evident in actual political practices or economic policies, but rather in collective debates about politics and morality-in short, in contemporary imaginaries of the nation. Contributing to a long-standing discussion of the moral stature of Tanzania's "father of the nation," the article explores how and why a shared historical memory of Nyerere is being built or contested to define, mediate, and construct Tanzanian conceptions of morality, belonging, and citizenship in the polis today.									1	0	0	0	1	0002-0206		WOS:000340825100001

J	Roberts, Les								Talkin bout my generation: popular music and the culture of heritage								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HERITAGE STUDIES				20	3	SI		262	280		10.1080/13527258.2012.740497			APR 3 2014	2014	Raymond Williams once remarked that 'Culture is one of the two or three most complicated words in the English language' (1983). He never said what the other ones were but had he been writing today, one of these might well have been 'heritage'. Indeed, the imbrications of 'culture' and 'heritage', and the vexed nature of their relationship, particularly with regard to popular music, are such that each has come to serve as a synonym for the other in the wider sociocultural imaginary. This paper casts a critical spotlight on discourses of cultural heritage in the UK by questioning what makes popular music culture 'heritage' and considering the extent to which the UK popular music has become increasingly heritagised. Relating the specific example of popular music to wider debates on cultural heritage and heritagisation, the paper calls for greater problematising of discourses of popular music as cultural heritage, and considers, by way of conclusion, how a critical focus on the lived, performative and 'hauntological' dynamics of music heritage practices can illuminate understandings of the way cultures of music and memory are negotiated and transacted in the present.									2	0	0	0	2	1352-7258		WOS:000333872300004		
J	Olarte Sierra, Maria Fernanda; Del Castillo Hernandez, Adriana Diaz								We Are All the Same, We All Are Mestizos': Imagined Populations and Nations in Genetics Research in Colombia								SCIENCE AS CULTURE				23	2			226	252		10.1080/09505431.2013.838214			APR 3 2014	2014	In Colombia, as in other Latin American countries, current population genetics research is based on the understanding that Colombians constitute a mestizo nation, given the admixture process that took place between Africans, Amerindians, and Europeans during colonial times. The mestizo is a pervasive category used by geneticists to conduct, organise, and publish research studies that deal with the continent's peopling process and the genetic makeup of its contemporary population(s). It is also the dominant imaginary for the Colombian population and a key nation-building ideology. By tracing how this category moves and is used across four Colombian genetics laboratories, it is possible to discern that despite its apparently clear-cut boundaries, the mestizo is contingent, contested, and flexible, allowing for multiple understandings and usages. This flexibility and multiplicity are visible in the quantification of genetic ancestry, the divisions of geographical location, and the understanding of gender. Such understandings allow one to think about a homogeneous nation (inclusive) that is simultaneously heterogeneous (exclusive); they provide multiple but not necessarily contradictory possibilities of being mestizo, allowing the coexistence of images of the nation that could otherwise seem contradictory; and they permit navigation around contested terms such as race, while simultaneously thinking of mixed races or racialised individuals. Finally, these flexible and multiple constructions of the mestizo (re)produce various subjects as other', whether they are women, the Indigenous, the black/dark, or the poor.									1	0	0	0	1	0950-5431		WOS:000335212200004		
J	Ajello, Linell								Soldiers, scapegoats, and the tragic demands of Operation First Casualty								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES				17	3			243	257		10.1177/1367877913489371			MAY 2014	2014	In 2008, the activist group Iraq Veterans Against the War (IVAW) produced Operation First Casualty, a piece of guerrilla theater staged on streets and in parks in U.S. cities, in which members performed actions that they had carried out as they patrolled Iraq and Afghanistan. In opposition to representations of war that excerpt violent events from daily life, IVAW portrays military culture as one of habitual brutality. At the same time, Operation First Casualty placed an audience of American bystanders in positions akin to those of Iraqis and Afghanis, in an attempt to engage empathy for, and enable solidarity with, the people whose countries are occupied by the US. Due to what I describe as soldiers' function as a scapegoat figure in the national imaginary, IVAW's insight has had little influence on public discourse. To understand the co-determinacy of the marginal status of soldiers and the social framing that gives the soldier figure such pull, I overlay theories of tragedy and political sociology in which scholars explore the ritualistic dynamics of scapegoats, collective identity, and outsiders in democratic society.									0	0	0	0	0	1367-8779		WOS:000333552900003		
J	Jamieson, Kirstie								Tracing festival imaginaries: Between affective urban idioms and administrative assemblages								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES				17	3			293	303		10.1177/1367877913487550			MAY 2014	2014	This article offers a way of understanding not only Festival Cities, but also the Creative City paradigm and to some extent the practices employed through the convergence of culture and urban planning that has come to dominate the logic of urban space. In its exploration of the 20th century's nascent administrative imaginary of urban cultural festivals it is in part, a genealogy, but I hope it offers more, that it elaborates a re-reading of the urban predisposition towards a culturalized identity and the curation of affective urban space, which despite the economic downturn, continues to privilege its own legibility. In so doing, this article argues that the city promotes not only its cultural capital, but also its administration.									0	0	0	0	0	1367-8779		WOS:000333552900006		
J	D'Angelo, Lorenzo								WHO OWNS THE DIAMONDS? THE OCCULT ECO-NOMY OF DIAMOND MINING IN SIERRA LEONE								AFRICA				84	2			269	293		10.1017/S0001972013000752			MAY 2014	2014	Much of the literature on Sierra Leonean diamonds focuses on the role that this mineral resource played in the recent civil conflict (1991-2002). However, the political-economic perspective that is common to these analyses has lost sight of the main actors in this social reality. What do miners think of diamonds? Like their Malagasy colleagues engaged in the search for sapphires, the Sierra Leonean diamond miners often maintain that they do not know what diamonds could possibly be used for. What is specific to the diamond mining areas in this West African country is that suspicions and fantasies about the uses of diamonds go hand in hand with the idea that these precious stones belong to invisible spiritual entities known locally as djinns or d epsilon bul d epsilon n. Although this article aims to analyse the occult imaginary of diamond miners, it takes a different stand from the occult economies approach. By combining a historical-imaginative perspective with a historical and ecological one, this article intends to highlight the indissoluble interweaving of material and imaginative processes of artisanal diamond production in the context of Sierra Leone's mines.									0	0	0	0	0	0001-9720		WOS:000334106500005

High-density electroencephalography was used to define the spatial diffusion of tDCS after effects. Ten healthy subjects performed a finger tapping task with the right hand before and after three separate sessions of 20 minutes of Sham, AtDCS or CtDCS over left primary motor cortex (M1). During movement, we found an increment of low alpha band Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) in bilateral central, frontal areas and in the left inferior parietal region, as well as an increment of beta ERD in fronto-central and parieto-occipital regions, after AtDCs compared to Sham and CtDCS. In the rest pre-movement period, after Sham as well as AtDCS, we documented an increment of low alpha band power over the course of pre- and post-stimulation recording sessions, localized in the sensorimotor and parieto-occipital regions. On the contrary, after CtDCS no increment of low alpha power was found. Finally beta band coherence among signals from left sensorimotor cortex and activity of bilateral parietal, occipital and right frontal regions was higher after AtDCS compared with Sham condition. Similarly, theta coherence with parietal and frontal regions was enhanced after AtDCS. We hypothesize that the local modulation of membrane polarization, as well as long-lasting synaptic modification induced by tDCS over M1, could result in changes of both local band power and functional architecture of the motor network.

In what ways do these organizations relate to Islamic traditions in their work? What role do religious convictions play in the construction of modern selfhoods among their employees and volunteers? Do these constructions relate to broader, globally relevant, social imaginaries? The article tries to answer these questions by applying a novel analytical framework to qualitative data from fieldwork conducted among Jordanian charities and social welfare organizations. We treat these organizations as "social sites" for the reinterpretation of Islamic traditions in the context of global modernity as well as for the construction of meaningful forms of modern selfhoods among their members. In doing so, we argue that these specifically Islamic identity constructions can fruitfully be understood with reference to different types of globally relevant social imaginaries.									1	0	0	0	1	0020-7438		WOS:000334121100005

A Portuguese territory for half a millennium, Macau was returned to the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1999; the postcolonial, semi-autonomous Macau Special Administrative Region has subsequently become the most lucrative casino gaming site in the world, far surpassing casino revenues earned in Las Vegas. This article investigates the manner in which the local government of the city-state and the central government of the PRC have colluded with transnational capital to effect a remarkable enclosure of the urban commons in Macau. The entire city today may be understood as a biopolitical laboratory of consumption, where the PRC uses a preferential exit visa policy to allow tourists from select, relatively affluent provinces access to Macau. The new built environment of the city naturalizes a radical urban imaginary and corresponding post-socialist 'quality' consumer subject; that subject is crucial to the macroeconomic goals of the PRC and the sustainability of global capitalism.									0	0	0	0	0	0309-1317		WOS:000333800700006

Whilst their contribution has been widely recognized in terms of a cross-pollination of ideas from the fine arts to the performing arts, this essay also addresses the influence that compositional methods, based on techniques derived from figural drawing, as well as the study of form and geometry, might have had in their choreographic practice. I argue that despite stylistic similarities, these works present a divergent approach to the question of a geometrized motion design, which Schlemmer called 'mathematics in motion'. I discuss the concept of 'abstract dance' promoted by Kandinsky, in terms of a visualistic method, where movement is rendered both as a succession of still images and as an imaginary process. Schlemmer, on the other hand, promoted a synthesis of abstract and physical, as part of a model for live performance known as 'balletic mathematics'. I expand on this distinction in terms of a differential sense schematic approach to movement, one being visual, the other proprioceptive. Landmark works produced by these artists during the Bauhaus years (1922-1933) are called upon as case studies, including Kandinsky's Dance Curves (after Gret Palucca), and Schlemmer's renowned Stabetanz.									0	0	0	0	0	0264-2875		WOS:000334843200002		
J	Mohamed, Najma								Islamic Education, Eco-ethics and Community								STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY AND EDUCATION				33	3	SI		315	328		10.1007/s11217-013-9387-y			MAY 2014	2014	Amid the growing coalescence between the religion and ecology movements, the voice of Muslims who care for the earth and its people is rising. While the Islamic position on the environment is not well-represented in the ecotheology discourse, it advances an environmental imaginary which shows how faith can be harnessed as a vehicle for social change. This article will draw upon doctoral research which synthesised the Islamic ecological ethic (eco-ethic) from sacred texts, traditions and contemporary thought, and illustrated how this ethic is enlivened in the educational landscape of Islam. Knowledge of the relationship between human beings and the natural world, of the creative order upon which the world was created, and of right living, is essential in this educational project and the global ecoIslamic movement employs a range of institutes, from the masjid to the maktab, to impart the environmental message of Islam. Despite the manifestation of environmental education activities across the educational establishment, much of what passes as Islamic education today is not representative of the holistic, integrated and comprehensive educational philosophy of Islam. Contemporary social concerns, such as the environmental question, can, in my view, act as an impetus to develop a pedagogy which endeavours to be true to the religious traditions, values and ethics of Islam, while also displaying the transformative force of this faith. Muslims, at more than one-fifth of the world population, own a fair share of global concern around the earth's health and well-being. Across the world, many continue to base their life and lifestyle decisions on the teachings of Islam, and are showing the relevance of traditional resources and institutions in meeting one of the greatest challenges facing humanity-the health of our planet.									0	0	0	0	0	0039-3746		WOS:000334523000007		
J	Waghid, Yusef; Davids, Nuraan								On the (Im)possibility of Democratic Citizenship Education in the Arab and Muslim World								STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY AND EDUCATION				33	3	SI		343	351		10.1007/s11217-013-9393-0			MAY 2014	2014	The euphoria of the recent Arab Spring that was initiated in northern African countries such as Tunisia, Egypt and Libya and spilled over to Bahrain, Yemen and Syria brings into question as to whether democratic citizenship education or more pertinently, education for democratic citizenship can successfully be cultivated in most of the Arab and Muslim world. In reference to the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates) in the Middle East, we argue that unless gender inequality, mostly instigated by religious-tribal and patriarchal perspectives, is eradicated, it would be impossible to engender any plausible conception of education for democratic citizenship in most of the Arab and Muslim world. Our thesis rests on an understanding that, firstly, education in the Arab and Muslim world is located in an impoverished view of education for Muslims; and secondly, that the notable absence of democratic citizenship is enhanced by gender-based discrimination in society especially in the professions and politics. We contend that education for democratic citizenship in the Arab and Muslim world is necessary and ought to be framed along a pluralist imaginary of citizenship. However, considering the continued prevalence of authoritarianism at politico-social levels our argument is that it seems feasible to enhance and at times disrupt the cultivation of national education drawing on some of the features of a pluralist imaginary of citizenship.									0	0	0	0	0	0039-3746		WOS:000334523000009		
J	Camilleri, Kristian								Toward a constructivist epistemology of thought experiments in science								SYNTHESE				191	8			1697	1716		10.1007/s11229-013-0358-1			MAY 2014	2014	This paper presents a critical analysis of Tamar Szabo Gendler's view of thought experiments, with the aim of developing further a constructivist epistemology of thought experiments in science. While the execution of a thought experiment cannot be reduced to standard forms of inductive and deductive inference, in the process of working though a thought experiment, a logical argument does emerge and take shape. Taking Gendler's work as a point of departure, I argue that performing a thought experiment involves a process of self-interrogation, in which we are compelled to reflect on our pre-existing knowledge of the world. In doing so, we are forced to make judgments about what assumptions we see as relevant and how they apply to an imaginary scenario. This brings to light the extent to which certain forms of skill, beyond the ability to make valid logical inferences, are necessary to execute a thought experiment well.									1	0	0	0	1	0039-7857		WOS:000335505900003

Concepcion (Chile), 1950-2010								EURE-REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE ESTUDIOS URBANO REGIONALES				40	120			91	110					MAY 2014	2014	The discussion of a development plan conceived from the notion of territory is proposed here as. a central challenge. Thus, items that are gradually giving support to the notion of the city, on the basis of the different discourses about development prevalent today. From this starting point, we try to problematize the concept of territory in the field of public action, and explore how new forms of organization and spatial assessments are articulated stemming from discourse practices. We conclude, opening a longer-term discussion, that to look at the city as an object of planning seems unwise, as it is more a dynamic process than a static entity. Geo-historically it evidences trends and forms that only make sense in time, making it necessary to look at the city in a broader perspective. This is explored and discussed in the case of Metropolitan Area of Concepcion (AMC).									0	0	0	0	0	0250-7161		WOS:000335546000005

This work uses the methodologies of discussion group and sociological discourse analysis to identify the discourses of future professionals from other regions in Chile about the Region of Antofagasta, a mining area located in Northern Chile. Despite the growing prosperity of this region during the past two decades, the discourses that represent Antofagasta have a negative denotation with different features according to the socio-spatial distance to this region and gender. These representations could reduce the arrival of qualified migrants and women to Antofagasta and negatively affect the future development of the region.									0	0	0	0	0	0250-7161		WOS:000335546000008		
J	Limon L, Pedro								Geographical imagination and agency: producing public space through Law in Madrid (1992-2012)								EURE-REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE ESTUDIOS URBANO REGIONALES				40	120			183	200					MAY 2014	2014	The analysis of public space has been one of the most controversial social and political research areas, primarily because of its ambiguity and polysemy. Oftentimes, the confusion of the notions of public space and public sphere has supposed the assimilation of both elements and the assumption of their existence in essentialist terms. This perspective does not consider the actual policy practices they produce. From the perspective of critical Political Geography of Law, the aim of this paper is to explore how institutional agency has been regulating and signifying public spaces in Madrid in the last two decades. The results show three central consequences of that institutionally produced geographical imagination: public space restricted to institutions, citizenship as giving structure to the urban, and the territorial fragmentation of multiple activities. These, in turn, invite a questioning and redefinition of Madrid's public spaces.									0	0	0	0	0	0250-7161		WOS:000335546000009

J	Southern, Jen; Ellis, Rebecca; Ferrario, Maria Angela; McNally, Ruth; Dillon, Rod; Simm, Will; Whittle, Jon								Imaginative labour and relationships of care: Co-designing prototypes with vulnerable communities								TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE				84				131	142		10.1016/j.techfore.2013.08.003			MAY 2014	2014	Science-fiction prototyping is often used to explore the social implications of science and technology and to provide inspiration for innovation. The future that is being imagined however often exhibits a form of techno-optimism. This paper critiques that optimism by describing the #Patchworks project in which science fiction prototypes were used to explore the social implications of who does the imagining. Through our vignette we explore how the promissory nature of science fiction prototyping folds back into the present to change current understandings of real life situations. We suggest that the power to imagine and invent futures is often not extended to vulnerable communities, nor does it take into account the differing authority and agency depending on who is telling and who feels able to tell stories. The collision between these different stories and backgrounds in #Patchworks, the co-design project informing this paper, has produced contradictions and negotiations between the speculative practice of 'tinkering' used by DIY hackers that act as 'openings', an academic focus on innovation and the 'anchoring' inherent in the need to produce practical prototypes that solve urgent problems.

J	Grillo, Luca								A DOUBLE SERMOCINATIO AND A RESOLVED DILEMMA IN CICERO'S PRO PLANCIO								CLASSICAL QUARTERLY				64	1			214	225		10.1017/S0009838813000669			MAY 2014	2014	In the litigious world of ancient Rome patroni were often torn between conflicting bonds of loyalty, and this is the dilemma that Cicero laments in the exordium of the Pro Plancio (5). Both the prosecutor, Laterensis, and the accused, Plancius, were personal friends, and Cicero bemoans the quandary: either upsetting Laterensis by comparing him unfavourably with Plancius, or letting down his client. A second problem for Cicero was that the prosecution also took the opportunity to impugn him as the creature of Pompey and Caesar, so that Cicero had to defend himself as much as his client. Two examples of sermocinatio (an imaginary dialogue with a personified entity) helped him to face these challenges: these sermocinationes are Cicero's main strategy for getting out of the conundrum but, in spite of their relevance to his line of argument, they have received very little attention. In this article, after a brief historical contextualization, I analyse each sermocinatio, arguing that Cicero cunningly sets aside the dilemma of comparing two friends by constructing an alternative comparison between Laterensis and himself, and that such a comparison, which is highly selective, re-establishes his own positive public image. The two sermocinationes, moreover, also display some meaningful textual references which have remained unnoticed: in the final part of this paper I set them against the backdrop of Plato's Crito and of Cicero's letter to Lentulus (Fam. 1.9), arguing that the reference to the Crito supports Cicero's strategy of contrasting himself with Laterensis and that comparison with Fam. 1.9 illuminates the connection between the Pro Plancio and Cicero's broader post reditum self-defence.									0	0	0	0	0	0009-8388		WOS:000334589700017

J	Raddeker, Helene Bowen								Feminism and spirituality in fantastic fiction: Contemporary women writers in Australia								WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM				44				154	163		10.1016/j.wsif.2013.12.009			MAY-JUN 2014	2014	In this paper I argue that in Anglophone fantasy-writing depictions of feminist alternatives to patriarchal religion have been more varied than fantasy analysts acknowledge. Perhaps if critics based in the United States were to take more account of other national literatures, such differences would be recognized more often. Focusing on women authors since the 1990s, I demonstrate how in Australian fantasy there has been little sign of a celebration of ' the Goddess in imaginary goddess-and woman-led cultures. Arguably, this is largely due to the comparative absence in Australian feminist politics, culture and scholarship of the goddess side of spiritual feminism, which since the 1970s has had a significant impact in North America. I suggest in the paper that this absence can be explained by other differences of long standing between American and Australian feminism; by the impact also of post-Second Wave feminisms; as well as by other national differences.

J	Boletsi, Maria								Still Waiting for Barbarians after 9/11? Cavafy's Reluctant Irony and the Language of the Future								JOURNAL OF MODERN GREEK STUDIES				32	1			55	80					MAY 2014	2014	C. P. Cavafy's poem "Waiting for the Barbarians" (1904) has been adapted and restaged in art, music, and literature throughout the twentieth century. Since the early 1990s, and especially since the events on 11 September 2001, however, it seems to be haunting the Western imaginary. Its various allegorical uses in the press and cultural theory demonstrate the poem's prominent figuration in debates about post-Cold War and post-9/11 realities. Cavafy's poem is mobilized in critiques of the American Empire. It helps express the fear of others or of the unknown after the purported rupture of 9/11. But it also captures the desire for overturning saturated systems and forming new narratives and communities in the context of the financial crisis and recent protest movements. Besides functioning as an allegorical formula for capturing contemporary (global) realities, the poem also assumes a mediating function in current debates: it seeks alternative expressive modes, beyond metaphysical truths and essentialist oppositions, as well as beyond cultural relativism. This function takes effect through the poem's evocation of two genealogies of "barbarism": a negative and an affirmative one. The poem neither rejects nor fully affirms either of these genealogies. It thereby generates a kind of irony that can be termed "reluctant" in its questioning of and simultaneous attraction to metaphysics and presence. Through its reluctant irony, the poem seeks a viable practice of living in liminal times a practice much needed in (our) times of crisis.									0	0	0	0	0	0738-1727		WOS:000338169300003

J	Yazdani, Saeed								Imaginary Folkloric Beings in the Iranian People's Beliefs								ANTHROPOLOGIST				17	3			967	973					MAY 2014	2014	Folkloric beings have played important roles in the cultures of different countries in the world since ancient times. In Iran they have formed a part of people's beliefs and culture. They have been of great significance in the lives of the Persians. An attempt is made in this paper to study the Iranian people's beliefs in these beings; for this purpose the author has focused on the beliefs of different people located in different parts of Iran. The Persians, in the past, used to enact some of these beliefs in the form of rituals which were meant to protect their family members. These beliefs have been useful in the education of children too. There have been such folkloric beings which have affected even the lives of the adults in Iran, and have encouraged the latter to overcome their fears. The author has made an attempt to collect data through library sources. As a result, he has found out that the rituals concerning these imaginary beings have been held in dramatic forms, and have been attributed with such elements like plot, actor and stage designing.									0	0	0	0	0	0972-0073		WOS:000340016100031

There are very few quantitative Mexican studies on media representation of minority groups, such as indigenous peoples. A content analysis of fiction programs broadcast on national television in 2010 was conducted to understand the television image of the indigenous population. The results show a reduced presence of indigenous characters, usually cast in secondary or supporting roles. The physical traits, appearance and attitudes that determine their stereotypes were detected. The possible impact of this representation on the social imaginary of the collective is discussed.

In both cases, the private sphere is designated as the primary domain of women and the agency of women in the public sphere is limited by the symbolic duties they are expected to perform in accordance with the national imaginary.									0	0	0	0	0	0026-3206		WOS:000334661800008

The success and stability of this role is considered, and a coherent position regarding the nature of creativity is outlined. Examination of the "evidence" gathering projects used to bulwark this position, however, reveals how the data which emerge from such projects may no longer appropriately serve to support the position the creative industries have come to occupy within the dominant imaginary. It is argued that this imaginary persists in providing a coherent framework for understanding and for action, however, regardless of the contradictions it contains. A tangible example of this "imaginary success" is briefly considered within the UK context, via an examination of developments around the staging of the European Capital of Culture programme in Liverpool, England in 2008. In this case, it is also argued that apparent contradictions are successfully concealed by dominant positions regarding culture and creativity. In conclusion, some explanations for this state of affairs are considered, and it is argued that the increased attention being paid to cultural creativity may render the continued concealment of these contradictions untenable.									0	0	0	0	0	0965-4313		WOS:000335841600006

We explore how the particular spaces in which they settled affected these migrants' capacities to perform what they saw as hegemonic masculinities over time. We find that they initially experienced an increase in status that they were able to convert into assets in romantic relationships, permitting them to position themselves as 'providers' and 'real white men,' drawing on masculine ideals from their home countries as well as a diffuse neocolonial imaginary. In the long run, however, these identity constructions were subject to internal contradictions and attrition. They were also place-bound, creating both financial and social obstacles to a return home, particularly for those without ties to transnational capital. The ways these patterns differ from those in existing scholarship underline how both the particular spaces of migrant settlement and temporal dimensions are critical for the analysis of migrant masculinities.									0	0	0	0	0	1464-9365		WOS:000333873400005

Each measures the inevitable illusion generated by these pieces against the imaginary triggered in those, senders and recipients, who ensure the postcard's destiny.									0	0	0	0	0	1740-9292		WOS:000335883900011

Toward an Anthropology of the Imaginary: Specters of Disability in Vietnam								ETHOS				42	2			153	174		10.1111/etho.12046			JUN 2014	2014	In this article, I discuss the analytical potential that the notion of the imaginary holds for anthropology as a concept that may capture some of the more subdued, yet socially vigorous, moods and sensations that hover where personal experience and socially salient forms of power merge. The ethnographic occasion for my inquiry is the eager uptake of new technologies for selective reproduction in Vietnam; technologies that are actively promoted by the party-state as an element in efforts to enhance "population quality." Drawing on nearly three years of fieldwork conducted in Vietnam's capital Hanoi, I frame selective reproduction as an issue of power and politics, investigating how people's fantasies, fears, and imaginings blend with the workings of state power in this realm. Attention to imaginary constructions of self and society, I argue, can further anthropological understanding of the ways in which state policies are shaped, implemented, justified, and received.									0	0	0	0	0	0091-2131		WOS:000334348400003

In each of these turns, as psychiatrists read female bodies for signs of affliction and media portray counter trajectories of aspiration and downfall, certain realities are shielded from consideration, including sexual violence in intimate settings.									0	0	0	0	0	0165-005X		WOS:000336426900006	24700143

This wave of reforms has given enhanced visibility to external stakeholders, which has been often received with contrasting views. Some regarded it as a factor that would undermine institutions' mission, while others viewed it as a rhetorical change, which would hardly have an impact on institutional life. In this paper, we analyse the introduction of external stakeholders in governance and quality assessment processes by looking at the Portuguese experience, and more specifically at their contribution to the implementation of internal quality assurance systems. We use empirical data collected from four higher education institutions under the framework of the IBAR project, subsumed in the form of bathers to and good practices for the implementation of policies and procedures for quality assurance. The results suggest that although the presence of external stakeholders has become more visible, it is yet to be fully reflected in the way institutions are governed or the way in which they manage their internal quality assurance processes and mechanisms									0	0	0	0	0	0952-8733		WOS:000336351000005

We follow the trope of model organism' as it is under discussion within science and technology studies and as an ironic descriptor for our own interest in Lucy as an entity/project through which to illuminate figurations within robotics more widely. Primate and robot together are forms of natureculture that help to clarify how the categories of animal and machine are entangled, while making explicit investments in their differences from one another, and from the third category of the human. We conclude, again following Haraway, by imagining what other possibilities there might be for figuring humans, robots, and their relations if we escape the reiterative imaginary of the robot as proxy for becoming human.									1	0	0	0	1	0306-3127		WOS:000336332200001	25051585

Even though obviously opposed, both works present the importance of the family: the first as a means to present a modern family model in accordance with Franco's Regime; and the second as a refuge from a society more centred on the individual. Resembling two sides of the same coin, the dialogue between both films is clear: Palacios' work being a reference in the collective imaginary of all those directors who, as time went by, decided to present the family as an oppressive space. However, while Leon de Aranoa certainly shows a broad repertoire of situations that endanger the stability of the group, he also sends a positive message: the family can be seen as a shelter against solitude.									0	0	0	0	0	1468-2737		WOS:000337056600004		
J	Perenic, Urska								An overview of literary mapping projects on cities: literary spaces, literary maps and sociological (re)conceptualisations of space								NEOHELICON				41	1			13	25		10.1007/s11059-013-0226-5			JUN 2014	2014	The status of literary mapping projects as applied to national capitals or large cities invites fascinating modes of exegesis. The use of literary maps, now one of the main tools in spatially-oriented literary studies, reveals, among other phenomena, the relationship between real and imaginary spaces. This essay proffers two options: maps used in literary studies in a limited fashion and in tandem with spatial studies-i.e., geographical analyses-or a renunciation of maps when literary imageries of cities are determined to be fictional and unreal. The latter possibility is supported particularly by modern sociological (re)conceptualisations of space, which, prior to the spatial turn in post-modernist studies, advocated the view that (city) space is a result of specific material features and of the social dynamics and practices of the users of that space. All considered, it is time perhaps that literary studies reconsider these models and the (appropriate or inappropriate) use of maps.									0	0	0	0	0	0324-4652		WOS:000337093200002		
J	Snel, Guido								The past is always in the present. Aether and the returns of history and Europe's new post-1989 peripheries. The cases of Mihail Sebastian's diary and Emir SuljagiA double dagger's Srebrenica memoir								NEOHELICON				41	1			241	256		10.1007/s11059-013-0212-y			JUN 2014	2014	In this article I have used the notion of 'the aether'aEuro"radio space-in two non-fiction texts, to analyse how both older and more recent trauma reconfigured post-1989 European literary geography into a new constellation of a centre and peripheries. I describe how Mihail Sebastian's Diary, written between 1935 and 1944, but not published until 1996, reflects the idea of a European Hochkultur that could be maintained by listening to classical music on the radio, while anti-Semitism and ethnic persecution denied the author his cosmopolitan Romanian-Jewish identity. The author's 'identity confusion' was transposed in the 1990s, when his diary's first publication in the midst of 'Romania's cultural wars' (Livezeanu) led to heated debates about the holocaust in Romania as a moral touchstone for its ways into Europe. The case of Sebastian is discussed alongside Emir SuljagiA double dagger's literary Srebrenica memoir, in which comparison with the holocaust deeply influences both the protagonist's interpretation of his own experience of ethnic persecution, and the European world's failure to identify with his position. The two cases shed light on how an imaginary European centre emerged in Eastern-Europe and the Balkans from the perspective of two peripheries, one old, one new.									0	0	0	0	0	0324-4652		WOS:000337093200019

Our knowledge of this interaction is based mainly on functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, but there is little direct evidence on how these changes manifest in terms of dynamic neuronal activity. This study reports on the presence of transient electroencephalography (EEG)-based measures of brain activity during motor imagery in spinal cord injured patients with CNP. We analyzed dynamic EEG responses during imaginary movements of arms and legs in 3 groups of 10 volunteers each, comprising able-bodied people, paraplegic patients with CNP (lower abdomen and legs), and paraplegic patients without CNR Paraplegic patients with CNP had increased event-related desynchronization in the theta, alpha, and beta bands (16-24 Hz) during imagination of movement of both nonpainful (arms) and painful limbs (legs). Compared to patients with CNP, paraplegics with no pain showed a much reduced power in relaxed state and reduced event-related desynchronization during imagination of movement. Understanding these complex dynamic, frequency-specific activations in CNP in the absence of nociceptive stimuli could inform the design of interventional therapies for patients with CNP and possibly further understanding of the mechanisms involved.Perspective: This study compares the EEG activity of spinal cord injured patients with CNP to that of spinal cord injured patients with no pain and also to that of able-bodied people. The study shows that the presence of CNP itself leads to frequency-specific EEG signatures that could be used to monitor CNP and inform neuromodulatory treatments of this type of pain.

J	Pop, Doru								THE WIZARDS OF THE VIOLET FLAME. A MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR OF ROMANIAN POLITICS								JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF RELIGIONS AND IDEOLOGIES				13	38			155	171					SUM 2014	2014	This study presents the manifestations of irrational practices in recent Romanian politics. Providing a short history of the mystical and the occult in Romanian politics, this research uses as a case study the alleged use of the occult "violet flame" in the presidential campaign of 2009. By showing how public religiousness and the daily mystical practices are changing, the author is describing the transformations of the national political communication under the pressure of the news media, which are becoming more and more pervasive to the occult discourses and the magical thinking. The author describes these transformations as part of the general transformations of the political imaginary in Romania. The Romanian public psyche belongs more and more to the culture of infotainment, a culture based on cultivating superficiality, where mystical and simplistic thinking have replaced the traditional processes of public exchange of reasonable ideas. Thus a main trait of this video-pathology in which the Romanian media is engulfed, is the substitution of the rational discourses with the superficial understanding of the world and supernatural explanations about the universe. One of the conclusions is that the manifestations and functions of the irrational in the Romanian political sphere have become more innocuously connected with a deep mysticism already in place, and are profoundly changing the society as a whole.									0	0	0	0	0	1583-0039		WOS:000337361100008

While literary representations of this figure have been well explored, this article contributes an examination of two visual narratives, paying particular attention to the manner in which genre and context influence the repurposing of this violent woman: the 1986 teleserie La Quintrala, produced by Chile's state-owned television station (TVN), and the Chilean newspaper Las ultimas noticias's 2008 comic 'La Quintrala y el Cristo de Mayo.' The teleserie, a product of the Pinochet era, positions her as an antithesis to the ideal Chilean woman, simultaneously denying her agency and condemning her. The comic echoes the rhetoric of the Concertacion governments as it prominently links La Quintrala's downfall and redemption to the genesis of modern Chile at the cost of her distinctive racial and gendered characteristics. Ultimately, each work employs the structure of confession to recall her crimes while rejecting the female agency and racially mixed heritage La Quintrala represents.									0	0	0	0	0	1356-9325		WOS:000337568300004

How have political stereotypes defined the kind of behaviour by women that could be part of Communist society? Starting from these questions, this article discusses the beginnings of the imaginary of militant Cuban women and its connections to the revolutionary Cuban imaginary: a symbolical register negotiated between the political Other and Self, that is, between the revolutionary institutions and the Left intellectual sympathisers who from its inception have visited the Cuban Revolution and have been its political and ideological guests. Specifically, I analyse three films of this cinema of political pilgrimage (Realengo 18, Cuba 58', Soy Cuba) as some of the founding productions of the Cuban revolutionary imaginary.									0	0	0	0	0	1356-9325		WOS:000337568300006		
J	Mehta, Brinda								Commemorating the "Disappeared": Maternal Activism and the Algerian Civil War in Fatima Bourega-Gallaire's La Beaute de l'icone								RESEARCH IN AFRICAN LITERATURES				45	2			26	45					SUM 2014	2014	This essay examines the "dangerous" role of women's theater, as highlighted in La Beaute de l'icone, Fatima Bourega-Gallaire's play on the Algerian civil war of the 1990s. The play exposes the violence of the "black decade" and highlights the gendered aggressions that have scarred Algeria's post-colonial imaginary in a radicalized economy of fear, terror, and censorship. La Beaute de l'icone is an intense enactment of another chapter in the history of the civil war the numerous abductions and forced "disappearance" of civilians during a pathological and power-driven reign of terror initiated by armed militias and government security forces. I demonstrate how the play adds another dimension to the civil war through two concomitant perspectives the state's role and culpability during the war, on the one hand, and the revolutionary activism of the "mothers of the disappeared" that inscribe their voices in a disavowed history. I further analyze the intersections between state terror and maternal power by examining the role of theater in exposing human rights violations to determine whether the aggressed can be given voice and visibility in a public text. La Beaute de l'icone thereby embraces an anti-war ethic by staging the violent trajectories of the civil war and its consequences. At the same time, it advocates a politics of peace through the suffering and courage of dissident mothers who refuse to accept the disappearance of their loved ones.									0	0	0	0	0	0034-5210		WOS:000337549600002

While it is implied that there may be contention around sociotechnical imaginaries, the literature on how that contention is manifested is scant. We use a frame-analytic approach to demonstrate the potency of collective action frames for making sense of the national imaginaries underpinning siting proposals. As a case study, we use woody biomass bioenergy development in northern Michigan. After briefly outlining the multiple frames that are encompassed in the imaginary of bioenergy development, we focus on the wood for energy frame, employing the concept of frame keys to demonstrate how national imaginaries are interpreted differently by local and nonlocal actors involved in community sitings of proposed facilities. We find not only that frame keys are essential to how the national imaginary of bioenergy is interpreted, (re)produced, and responded to but also that framing processes are related to social movements that coalesce around competing collective memories of place.									0	0	0	0	0	0036-0112		WOS:000337757100004		
J	Lawson, Sean								The US military's social media civil war: technology as antagonism in discourses of information-age conflict								CAMBRIDGE REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS				27	2			226	245		10.1080/09557571.2012.734787			JUN 2014	2014	This article uses the controversy within the United States (US) military over the use of social media by individual military professionals as a window into larger debates about the nature of information-age conflict. Information and associated technologies are now central to the US military imaginary. But the controversy over social media is one indicator that the dominant discourse of information-age conflict is neither stable nor total. The introduction of a new technology can serve as an antagonism that turns latent, potential contradictions into substantive differences for policymaking. Thus, though the US military generally has embraced information and communication technologies (ICTs), the introduction of a particular ICT can still be a source of controversy. Military imaginaries, technologies and the relationships between them remain dynamic, contingent and sometimes contentious.									0	0	0	0	0	0955-7571		WOS:000338008500003

J	Mohler, Courtney Elkin								"A Little History Here, a Little Hollywood There": (Counter-) Identifying with the Spanish Fantasy in Carlos Morton's Rancho Hollywood and Theresa Chavez's L.A. Real								MODERN DRAMA				57	2			207	228		10.3138/md.0433R			SUM 2014	2014	Often considered the final conquest and ultimate summation of Manifest Destiny, California holds a unique place in the American imaginary. While the popular mythology of the Spanish fantasy has served to obscure the use of violence and racialized oppression throughout the colonization of the American Southwest, traces of such struggle remain in memories of the colonized as they continue to occupy this contested space. This paper examines Carlos Morton's ensemble-based political satire, Rancho Hollywood, and Theresa Chavez's one-woman show, L. A. Real, to navigate the dynamic experience of contemporary Southern Californian racialized identity. These two pieces diverge stylistically but share an inclusive, nuanced approach to making sense of history, exploring the material and epistemological impact of historical representation on Chicana/o identity over time. Rancho Hollywood and L. A. Real counter-identify with the Spanish-fantasy heritage by rejecting stereotyping, questioning sanitized versions of Californian history, and voicing personal narratives that resist dominant regional myths and their associated racial ascriptions. Each play stages alternative versions of history that include personal experience and cultural memory; this transformative, productive approach to identity formation articulates agency over the memory of California.									0	0	0	0	0	0026-7694		WOS:000337960200004

Drawing in particular on Hoy's reading of the Foucauldian account of temporality, we conceive of disciplinary power regimes and resistance as inherently future-oriented, or, to use Ybema's term, postalgic. In moving beyond the extant research focus on self-disciplined and/or counter-resistant professional selves, we draw attention to the imaginary future self as an employee response to disciplinary power. In contrast to the future orientation of disciplinary power, this response envisages the future as a discontinuous break with the present which we examine as a form of resistant postalgia. Building on in-depth qualitative data gathered at two professional service firms, we explain how imaginary future selves can shed new light on the interplay of power, resistance and subjectivity.									2	0	0	0	2	0170-8406		WOS:000337957600005

Conventional equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) and synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) were used to analyze MEG data. Neural synchronization was studied using imaginary coherence to analyze resting-state MEG data. The ECDs, SAM, and MEG results were then compared with intra/extra-operative EEG.Results: Abnormal imaginary coherence was identified in all patients (30/30, 100%). The locations of abnormal imaginary coherence were in agreement with the ECDs locations of spikes in 23 patients (23/30, 76.7%). The ECD locations in 5 patients were scattered or located bilaterally. The locations of abnormal imaginary coherence were in agreement with SAM locations in 26 patients (26/30, 86.7%). One case of imaginary coherence was located in two lobes. The ECDs fit locations were in agreement with SAM locations in 21 patients (21/30, 70.0%). The locations of abnormal imaginary coherence, ECDs, and SAM were in agreement with intra/extra-operative EEG in 23 patients (23/30, 76.7%), 17 patients (17/30, 56.7%), and 20 patients (20/30, 66.7%), respectively. The results of ECDs location, SAM location, imaginary coherence, and intracranial EEG (iEEG) were consistent in 15 patients (15/30, 50%).Conclusions: The results show that patients with epilepsy have abnormal imaginary coherence, and suggest that the location and coherence of epileptic activity could be quantitatively identified and analyzed using neuromagnetic signals.

J	Coetser, Johan								The Sea (2011) by Reza de Wet: A Slave Drama?								TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE				54	2			235	247					JUN 2014	2014	Although Die see (The Sea, 2011) depicts a single day in 1795 in the lives of three female slaves, the playwright does not use the words "slave drama" or "slave play" to describe her text. These words do not appear in the published play at all. In spite of the absence of the words "slave drama" or "slave play", I consider the three slaves in the play as representing all slaves. My discussion consequently concerns the marginal position of all slaves and their longing for freedom. In the play, the slaves 'anonymous owner and master holds Ou Vrou (Old Woman), Vrou (Woman) and Meisie (Maiden) captive in a dungeon beneath the Castle in Cape Town. Outside, a British naval force approaches the Dutch settlement from the Muizenberg side of the peninsula. The sound of approaching canon can be heard Oblivious of their impending liberation, the three slaves discuss their experiences of being treated as the property, or sexual objects, of their master. True to her character, each slave expresses in her own way her longing for freedom. For now, all they can do is to escape to an imaginary garden in their dreams or dream of their childhood outside the Castle.Notwithstanding the absence of clear indications that Die see is a slave drama, the didascalies provide hints that this may be the case. Such indications include descriptions of the dramatis personae, references to the time of and the place in which the action occurs, and dedicating the play to Peter Voges for keeping the memories of slaves alive and for showing respect for the role they played in establishing the colony.In the analysis, I address the question whether it is possible to identify Die see as a slave play from the perspective of the didascalies. As a first step, I identify, the main features of slave dramas in general, and then I compare Die see from the point of view of the didascalies to these features. If this play could indeed be identified as a slave drama, it is possibly the only play in Afrikaans that deals with classical slavery.The nature of the didascalies in drama in general frames the question. Similar to Genette's notion of the paratext, the didascalies represent the extradiegetic and heterodiegetic voice of the playwright in the text. In Die see, the playwright's voice most clearly relates to De Wet's dedication of the play to Peter Voges. Her dedication shows two sides, in which past (memories of slavery as represented by the three slaves) and present ("liberation" from contemporary, alternative forms of "slavery') supplement each other.Juxtaposing memories of classical slavery (past) and "liberation" from alternative, comtemporary forms of "slavery", enables me to identify narrative and discursive structures, or the playwright's voice, in Die see. One side of the coin relates to information the playwright extracted from historical sources. De Wet does not indicate which source(s) she consulted, and whether they are written or oral. In my discussion, I made use of Robert Shell's Children of bondage, which, for the purpose of this article, proved to be an adequate and reliable source of information on slavery. In this section, I focus on the transposition of the Battle of Muizenberg, the accommodation of slaves in the Slave Lodge, the maltreatment of the three slaves as courtesans, and naming conventions as part of the fictionalised reality presented onstage.As part of the playwright's heterodiegetic voice, the other side of the coin allows for a double interpretation. The first interpretation relates to the playwright's' use of metaphors indicating decay. For instance, the cracked dungeon's walls housing rats and lice denote cracks in the existing and soon to be replaced Dutch regime. The second interpretation involves the fashion in which the playwright concludes her play. She provides her play with an open ending during which she suggests that Ou Vrou does not die at that time. De Wet employs sound effects that allow for an interpretation in which the moment of liberation by British forces anticipates the future liberation of all slaves men, women and children from all kinds of bondage. The playwright relates the slaves' freedom to important dates in South African slave history, namely 1795 (first British occupation of the colony), 1834 (legal liberation of slaves), and 1838 (last slaves set free).									0	0	0	0	0	0041-4751		WOS:000337716700005

In the first part of the paper the author argues for clues pointing to such an essential impact, by means of text passages as well as the facts of the Bion-Beckett case, up to and including issues of Bion's first publication The imaginary twin. The second part investigates the fate of the assumed cryptomnesia. From this point of view Bion's concept of the container appears to be the result of growth in the container-contained mode. Finally the author deals with the question whether cryptomnesia in psychoanalytical literature can frequently be seen as the result of psychic growth.									0	0	0	0	0	0178-7667		WOS:000338207900003

Recent decades have seen the resurgence of long-term mission and the emergence of short-term mission among US Christians. The latter, combining evangelization, service, and tourism, is a staple within evangelical youth culture. I argue that it is used by Christians to constitute themselves as global formations, while also offering theological frames for global Christianity. Central to this global theological imaginary are visual representations of mission encounters with ethnic, sectarian, and racial Others, which illustrate the global scope of mission and missionaries' understandings of their own efforts to engage and overcome those differences. Through an analysis of the visual content of four short-term mission agencies' websites, I examine the mediation of global Christianity in contemporary mission and its recruitment of global Christian subjects.									0	0	0	0	0	1743-2200		WOS:000338692600002		
J	de Becker, Emmanuel								Diagnostic reference marks of the infantile psychosis at the age of latency								ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES				172	4			313	320		10.1016/j.amp.2014.03.006			JUN 2014	2014	The concepts of "psychosis" and "latency" can, for some, to appear obsolete. We center on the first. It is clear that the concept of "psychosis" is hardly used than in the working frameworks being based on the psychodynamic epistemology and references. Other names came out without however focussing on the subjacent psychopathological aspects. The risk then appears to draw aside from the relevant methods of comprehension to apprehend the psychic and relational difficulties of a child and to stop with a primarily descriptive reading of those. It could follow of it a lack of depth in the therapeutic accompaniment rising from such a manner of proceeding. After having pointed out the psychopathological aspects, in the light of three clinical labels, the author evokes five registers of clinical signs which back up the diagnosis of psychosis in the child. Their intensity and their multiplicity define the depth of operation psychotic. Firstly, the language since the child psychotic is confronted with the difficulty of being located in a speech in the direction of the usual code of communication. Secondly, the anguish which is central in the problems of the psychosis, threatening the child constantly fights about it against the vacuum and the absence. Thirdly, the body of the child psychotic confronted with the question of the body envelope and the distinction enters the interior and external world. Fourthly, the report with the reality of the child psychotic presenting imaginary regularly overflowing, marked by confusion.. Fifthly, the trainings because, in the psychosis, the child tests usually difficulties to learn, learn how to say itself and to accept other what it does not know yet. The diagnostic step thus authorizes a time of observation, comprehension and stating necessary to the treatment. It aims at locating the evocative clinical signs of a disorganization of the thought, affects and social relations, likely to lead to the dysharmonic subject. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

VIH/sida: Expresion del imaginario de los estudiantes de enfermeria a traves de a fotografia.				Revista de enfermeria (Barcelona, Spain)				37	6			18	25					2014-Jun	2014	INTRODUCTION: Caring for people with HIV is an exercise of reflection and self-analysis in relation to our own beliefs about it. Along with the personal and social values, future nursing professional' beliefs have an important paper in the field of stigmatized diseases such as HIV infection, and may have an impact on nursing care. The aim of this study is to deeply know the meaning of the possibility of living with HIV among nursing students, bringing us a closer understanding of the subjective beliefs that give meaning to the act of caring.METHODOLOGY: Qualitative study with a phenomenological approach. Data collection was done through photographs and reflective stories.RESULTS: Living with HIV would change their lives, associating it to illness and fear of social rejection. Planning the future appears difficult, generating kind of uncertainty. However, some light of hope and social change is also observed.CONCLUSION: The possibility of acquiring HIV is lived as a negative experience associated with old fashioned experiences. It is necessary to facilitate forms of expression to visualize the internal processes of the opinions and invite discussion and permeation to other perspectives that may have an impact, direct or indirect, in nursing care.									0	0	0	0	0	0210-5020		MEDLINE:25087307	25087307

J	Bulka, Piotr								Nonlocal Transmission of Information and the Principle of Causality								FILOZOFIA NAUKI				22	2			137	+					JUN 2014	2014	The quantum mechanical tunneling effect was theoretically described in the first half of the last century, which witnessed the rise of quantum theory and ground-breaking experimental results in nuclear physics. A similar tunneling effect also takes place in the case of EM waves. The wave account (in the case of evanescent waves), the quantum-mechanical formalism, as well as the electrodynamical one, revealed a phenomenon that is counterintuitive and possibly even inconsistent with the special relativity theory paradigm. In the quantum formalism, the time of wave propagation within a photonic barrier is expressed as an imaginary number, which can be interpreted as the zero speed of propagation. In the nineties, scientists offered further experimental proofs of the theory; in experimental systems constructed for testing EM-waves tunneling, superluminal speed of propagation has been recorded. In the article, I introduce the problem of photon tunneling in the experimental context of the possibility of nonlocal wave propagation and superluminal transmission of information.									0	0	0	0	0	1230-6894		WOS:000339454300009		
J	Bo, Cao; Zhong, Yao								Molloy's Oedipal Dilemma and Games								FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES				36	3			84	93					JUN 2014	2014	In S. Beckett's novel Molloy, due to the father's absence or impotence, Molloy plays Oedipal games all the way back to the mother, thus revealing his mother-oriented fetishism. Meanwhile, due to the mother's decadence and the danger of incest, he draws upon mother-oriented scatology in his narrative, thus disclosing his misogyny and final surrender to the father's law. Molloy is a "problem subject" regressing from the Symbolic Order to the Imaginary Order, and the various enigmas and games described in his narrative are in essence dream-images of his Oedipal dilemma or, rather, of Beckett's "memories of being in the womb."									0	0	0	0	0	1003-7519		WOS:000339539500011

Building on Sollors' observations, this article suggests that the juxtaposition of machines and Indian spirits reflects an alchemical worldview, one that framed Spiritualist conceptions of materiality and spiritual progression. As an industrializing America transformed nature into a modern infrastructure, Andrew Jackson Davis and John Murray Spear spiritualized technology, likening electricity and electrical machines to the rarefied matter of the spirit world. By the same alchemical logic, the rarefication of an Indian-inscribed nature was thought to yield Native American spirits, who circulated in and through the nation's new machines. This narrative has continued to shape the metaphysical imaginary, even as the popularity of Spiritualism has declined, reflecting a sustained meditation on the ultimate meaning of industrialization in America.									0	0	0	0	0	0002-7189		WOS:000339956800009

By drawing on media and social theory, we argue for the relevance of circulation in theorizing current on-the-move social dynamics. Three particular perspectives are introduced in this exercise: non-linearity, action and materiality. As a methodological tool, circulation refers to the tracking and tracing of social actions. In this article, we examine in particular the creation and maintenance of social imaginaries. Our context of analysis is contemporary highly media-saturated society. A case study on media circulation of the 2011 death of Apple CEO Steve Jobs illustrates our theoretical and methodological reflection.									0	0	0	0	0	1367-5494		WOS:000340122200001

State Personhood, Abjection and the United States' HIV Travel Ban								MILLENNIUM-JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES				42	3			860	878		10.1177/0305829814541321			JUN 2014	2014	This article understands the United States' 23-year ban on travellers with HIV/AIDS through the lens of state personhood metaphors and the concept of abjection. Using insights from queer theory as a critique of sovereignty, it argues that the practices and discourses that brought about and sustained the ban, from 1987 until its lifting in 2010, relied upon implicit understandings of the state as a national body free from disease. Having shown the heuristic power of metaphors of the state as a body or person, the article goes on to argue that this identification of the American state as a homeostatic and healthy space facilitates the securitisation of mobility and public health and in turn the exclusion of people living with HIV (PLHIV). This rejection of PLHIV, sustained by conservative political discourse as much as by medical screening, nevertheless shows the impossibility of the state attaining its desired purity against HIV/AIDS and its associated sexual and racial imaginaries. The article concludes with an empirical overview of the context of the travel ban through to its lifting in 2010 and a discussion of the role of queer theory as a critique of state sovereignty.									0	0	0	0	0	0305-8298		WOS:000340545000016

The objective of the present article is to discuss the role that the different instances of the paternal function - the real father, the symbolic father, the imaginary father and the Name-of-the-Father - have in the constitution of the subject and in a clinical practice. The article begins with the writing of a clinical experience and the questions it brings forth. Next, we outline some of the developments that such concepts had in Lacan's work, highlighting the fact that while his theorization of the paternal problematic shifted permanently throughout his seminars, the articulation between its different elements remained an irrevocable conceptual requirement. The interdependence of these different instances in relation to what they operate in the structuring of the subject and the lacanian formulation of the Borromean RSI point to the clinical importance of considering the paternal instances in an interlaced way.	La pregunta acerca del padre sigue siendo central en la experiencia analítica, desde Freud hasta los días vigentes. El presente ensayo tiene como propósito discurrir respecto al papel que ejercen las distintas instancias de la función paterna - padre real, padre simbólico, padre imaginario y Nombre-del-Padre - en la constitución de un sujeto, articulándolas a un caso clínico. Para tal se parte de la escrita de dicha experiencia clínica y de los interrogantes suscitados por ella. A continuación, tratamos de señalar algunos desplazamientos que han tenido estos conceptos en la obra de Lacan, indicando que, si por un lado, la teorización de la problemática paterna se movió constantemente a lo largo de los seminarios de ese psicoanalista, por otro, la relación entre sus distintos elementos se mantuvo una cuestión conceptual irrevocable. La interdependencia de las distintas instancias respecto a lo que operan en la estructuración del sujeto y la formulación lacaniana de la estructura RSI borromeana apuntan la importancia clínica de considerar a las instancias paternas de forma enlazada.

Para tanto, parte-se da escrita de tal experiência clínica e dos interrogantes suscitados por ela. A seguir, buscamos delinear alguns desdobramentos que tais conceitos tiveram na obra de Lacan, realçando que, se por um lado a teorização da problemática paterna esteve em permanente deslocamento ao longo dos seminários desse psicanalista, por outro a articulação entre seus distintos elementos permaneceu como uma exigência conceitual irrevogável. A interdependência das diferentes instâncias com relação ao que elas operam na estruturação do sujeito e a formulação lacaniana da estrutura borromeana RSI apontam para a importância clínica de considerar as instâncias paternas de forma enlaçada.							0	0	0	0	0	0103-5665		SCIELO:S0103-56652014000100014

This cartography is polycentric and cut across by multidirectional transnational networks which facilitate the flows of people, ideas, images, capital and commodities. In this article, we investigate flows of Brazilian migrants who take religious beliefs, practices, and identities to host countries; missionaries and other religions entrepreneurs; foreign spiritual tourists who go to Brazil seeking healing and spiritual development; and culture industries, mass media, and the Internet that spread globally an imaginary of Brazil as an exotic land, where the sacred is an intrinsic part of its culture and nature.

Entre os vetores que vamos examinar estão: imigrantes brasileiros que na tentativa de dar sentido ao processo deslocamento e de manter ligações transnacionais com o Brasil levam suas crenças, práticas, identidades religiosas para o estrangeiro, missionários e outros "entrepreneurs" religiosos, o turismo espiritual de estrangeiros que vão ao Brasil em busca de cura ou desenvolvimento espiritual, e as indústrias culturais, a mídia e a Internet que disseminam globalmente imagens do Brasil como uma terra exótica onde o sagrado faz parte intrínseca de sua cultura e natureza.							0	0	0	0	0	0100-8587		SCIELO:S0100-85872014000100002		
J	Neimanis, Astrida; Walker, Rachel Loewen								Weathering: Climate Change and the "Thick Time" of Transcorporeality								HYPATIA-A JOURNAL OF FEMINIST PHILOSOPHY				29	3	SI		558	575		10.1111/hypa.12064			SUM 2014	2014	In the dominant "climate change" imaginary, this phenomenon is distant and abstracted from our experiences of weather and the environment in the privileged West. Moreover, climate change discourse is saturated mostly in either neoliberal progress narratives of controlling the future or sustainability narratives of saving the past. Both largely obfuscate our implication therein. This paper proposes a different climate change imaginary. We draw on feminist new materialist theories-in particular those of Stacy Alaimo, Claire Colebrook, and Karen Barad-to describe our relationship to climate change as one of "weathering." We propose the temporal frame of "thick time"-a transcorporeal stretching between present, future, and past-in order to reimagine our bodies as archives of climate and as making future climates possible. In doing so, we can rethink the temporal narratives of climate change discourse and develop a feminist ethos of responsivity toward climatic phenomena. This project reminds us that we are not masters of the climate, nor are we just spatially "in" it. As weather-bodies, we are thick with climatic intra-actions; we are makers of climate-time. Together we are weathering the world.									1	0	0	0	1	0887-5367		WOS:000340669600003

My aim in this essay is to consider what this analysis might mean for a feminist green politics and how those who believe in such a project might respond. Whereas much of the gender-focused scholarship on climate change is concerned with questions of differentiated vulnerabilities and gendered divisions of responsibility and risk, I want to interrogate the strategic, epistemological, and normative implications for ecological feminism of a dominant, neoliberal climate change narrative that arguably has no political subject, casts Nature as a threat to be endured, and that replaces democratic public debate with expert administration and individual behavior change. What hope is there for counter-hegemonic political theories and social movements in times like these? I suggest that rather than give in and get on the crowded climate change bandwagon, an alternative response is to pursue a project of feminist ecological citizenship that blends resistance to hegemonic neoliberal discourses with a specifically feminist commitment to reclaiming democratic debate about social-environmental futures.									1	0	0	0	1	0887-5367		WOS:000340669600006

Particularly, it is interested in the interaction between the changes caused by these policies, in the configuration of group networks and research centers, and the development of academic networks as a result of natural evolution of the scientific disciplinary and interdisciplinary activity. In the work are distinguished the following relevant dimensions: the internationalization of knowledge, as a result of the complexity of the knowledge; the context of new regulations in which they develop ways of organization of knowledge in universities; the historical context with new demands of society and government agencies. The methodological approach of the study is that of the new institutionalism, and the research strategy has been based on literature reviews and interviews with qualified operators. The main conclusion of the work is that the effect on the generation of knowledge networks for the implementation of these policies is not homogeneous. It is mediated by the institutional and historical conditions of each institution and disciplinary cultures.

The media is enthusiastic about them because they preach social peace, but they are criticized in smaller, more politicized circles. This article presents an analytical description of these projects as a social phenomenon, seeking to avoid this polarization while maintaining a critical eye. Because this initial analysis is still fairly superficial, we turn to the work of Stuart Hall, who wrote on similar issues of youth, imaginaries and violence in British culture, in search of a "more scientific" method of investigation. The article then presents considerations about Stuart Hall's investigative method, which he adapts from Marx, and uses it to raise more incisive questions about the social significance of such projects at this time.		Projetos culturais, de arte-educação ou socioeducativos, cujos públicos-alvo são a juventude pobre e negra, vêm ocupando cada vez mais espaço na mídia e no imaginário social.

Apresenta-se primeiro, neste trabalho, uma análise que procura driblar essa polarização e, mesmo assim, descreve-los de maneira crítica. Por considerar essa análise ainda bastante superficial, voltamos-nos para o trabalho de Stuart Hall, autor de obras importantes sobre questões parecidas de juventude, imaginário e violência na cultura britânica, em busca de um método "mais científico" de investigação. São apresentadas então considerações sobre o método de Hall, conceituado a partir da leitura de um texto de Marx, e, por meio desse método são levantadas questões analíticas mais incisivas sobre o significado social dos projetos no atual momento.							0	0	0	0	0	1982-2553		SCIELO:S1982-25532014000100014		
J	McCarthy, Jane Ribbens; Prokhovnik, Raia								Embodied Relationality and Caring after Death								BODY & SOCIETY				20	2			18	43		10.1177/1357034X13506469			JUN 2014	2014	We explore contested meanings around care and relationality through the under-explored case of caring after death, throwing the relational significance of bodies' into sharp relief. While the dominant social imaginary and forms of knowledge production in many affluent western societies take death to signify an absolute loss of the other in the demise of their physical body, important implications follow from recognising that embodied relational experience can continue after death. Drawing on a model of embodied relational care encompassing a me', a you' and an us', we argue that after death me' and us' remain (though changed) while crucial dimensions of you' persist too. In unravelling the binary divide between living and dead bodies, other related dichotomies of mind/body, self/other, internal/external, and nature/social are also called into question, extending debates concerning relationality and openness between living bodies. Through an exploration of autobiographical accounts and empirical research, we argue that embodied relationality expresses how connectedness is lived out after death in material practices and felt experiences.									0	0	0	0	0	1357-034X		WOS:000342763000002

Ethnography provides a holistic point of view of those persons who consume with respect to themselves, the environment, and the objects and/or goods available for meeting their needs, since it allows making an analysis of the business processes available for the members of a society who in turn become configurators of social representations and imaginaries in relation to acquisitions, uses, and adhesions, among other things, of what has been called merchandise in this article. These research possibilities allow the advertising exercise to find, among the number of daily data, the common elements underlying social configurations so that rhetoric in this kind of communication can be consistent with them in an attempt to reach the goal: persuasion.	Este artículo busca exponer la importancia de la reflexividad etnográfica como una herramienta investigativa que puede posicionarse como una de las mejores estrategias para el abordaje del consumidor, en tanto el sujeto es atravesado por el devenir de su realidad social. La etnografía proporciona una visión holística de ese sujeto que consume, en relación consigo mismo, con el entorno y con los objetos y/o bienes disponibles para la satisfacción de sus necesidades, en tanto que permite un análisis de los procesos mercantiles o no, de los que disponen los miembros de una sociedad, que a su vez se convierten en configuradores de representaciones sociales e imaginarios en relación con las adquisiciones, usos y adhesiones, entre otras cosas de lo que en este texto se ha denominado como mercancías. Estas posibilidades investigativas le proponen al ejercicio publicitario hallar, dentro del cúmulo de datos cotidianos, los elementos comunes que subyacen en las configuraciones sociales, buscando que la retórica en este tipo de comunicación sea acorde con estas, a fin de cumplir su fin último: la persuasión.								0	0	0	0	0	1692-2522		SCIELO:S1692-25222014000100004

J	Bhattacharya, Ananda								The Peripatetic Sannyasis: A Challenge to Peasant Stability and Colonial Rule?								INDIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW				41	1			47	66		10.1177/0376983614521733			JUN 2014	2014	Ever since Jamini Mohan Ghosh's study of the Sannyasi Uprising in the early years of British Rule the subject has widely drawn attention of scholars. On the basis of historical evidence he called the Sannyasis raiders from outside Bengal who extorted the peasants and zamindars of Bengal for money. But post-independence India has spawned two genres of ideology-driven historians-Marxist and Secularist-who care more for imaginary myths than for the truth of history. Marxists view the uprising as an early peasant rebellion against the British colonial exploitation. Not to be outdone; secularists go further and expound their pet idea of the uprising as a shining example of Hindu-Muslim unity because of occasional Sannyasi-Fakir joint action against the British. But when historians thus indulge in misinterpreting history they consciously take advantage of the unavoidable, subliminal, though minimal subjectivity of history. But the facts explode both myths. They were simply plunderers in religious garb severely tormenting the Bengal countryside. Ghosh's stand was correct, supported by historical evidence.									0	0	0	0	0	0376-9836		WOS:000346363400004

J	Smyrnis, Nikolaos; Mantas, Asimakis; Evdokimidis, Ioannis								Two independent sources of anisotropy in the visual representation of direction in 2-D space								EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH				232	7			2317	2324		10.1007/s00221-014-3928-7			JUL 2014	2014	It is known that visual direction representation is more accurate for cardinal directions compared to oblique, a phenomenon named the "oblique effect". It has been hypothesized that there are two sources of oblique effect, a low level one confined to vision and a high level one extending to different modalities and corresponding to higher cognitive processes. In this study directional error (DE) was measured when normal individuals tried to align the direction of an arrow presented in the center of a computer monitor to the direction of a peripheral target located in one of 32 directions equally spaced on an imaginary circle of 60 mm radius. Task difficulty was manipulated by varying arrow length (15, 30, 45 and 60 mm). By measuring mean DE and its variance we identified two independent sources of the oblique effect. A low level oblique effect was manifested in higher accuracy or equivalently lower variance of DE in the alignment for cardinal orientations compared to oblique. A second oblique effect was manifested measuring mean DE resulting in space expansion in the vicinity of cardinal directions and space contraction in the vicinity of oblique directions. Only this latter source of oblique effect was modulated by arrow length as predicted from a theoretical model postulating that this oblique effect is produced by a cognitive process of 2-D space categorization.									0	0	0	0	0	0014-4819		WOS:000337788600025	24696139	
J	Krobb, Florian								FAMILY REUNIONS IN GERMAN ADVENTURE LITERATURE ON AFRICA OF THE 1880S-A VISION FOR COLONIAL INTERVENTION: KARL BURMANN AND KARL MAY								GERMAN LIFE AND LETTERS				67	3			301	319		10.1111/glal.12044			JUL 2014	2014	Literature for young readers provides a pertinent barometer for the moods and preoccupations of a society at a given time. The study of two examples of adventure literature set in Africa, Karl Burmann's Im Herzen von Afrika (1880) and Karl May's Die Sklavenkarawane (1889/90), illustrates the preponderance of certain motifs like family reunions in the imaginary conquest of colonial space and the definition of the role Germans assigned to themselves on the continent of desire. The separation and reunion of members of a travelling party serve to demonstrate how the foreign intruders cope with the hostile conditions without losing themselves and their sense of community. In the process, they assemble groups of indigenous people into family units of their making and under their tutelage, thus assuming the role of mentor to African societies and claiming a kind of leadership without which, or so the suggestion goes, Africa would not achieve any awareness of self. In Karl May's novel, this role is asserted in competition with slave hunters, rivals for dominance over inner Africa. Adventure literature thus provides a blueprint for, and a legitimisation of, colonialist interference in Africa and allows a new generation to imagine themselves as both adventurers and benefactors.									0	0	0	0	0	0016-8777		WOS:000337587100001		
J	Orzeck, Reecia								Normative geographies and the 1940 Land Transfer Regulations in Palestine								TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS				39	3			345	359		10.1111/tran.12036			JUL 2014	2014	In recent years, there have been several calls for geographers to engage more closely with the normative in their work. This paper supplements those calls by suggesting that geographers turn their attention to popular understandings of and discourses about justice. In the first part of the paper, I make a case for such scholarship and argue that it should be undergirded by two premises. The first premise is that understandings of justice depend not only on abstract ideas about the just, but on the geographical and historical frames - geographical imaginaries through which we understand the world; the second is that understandings of justice (including both abstract ideas and geographical imaginaries) are deeply historical and social. In the second part of this paper, I demonstrate the centrality of historical and social geographical imaginaries to assessments of justice by examining the discourse surrounding the controversial 1940 Land Transfer Regulations in Palestine. Put in place at the behest of British Colonial Secretary Malcolm MacDonald, the Regulations restricted the areas in which Jews could buy land in Palestine. While Jews in Palestine condemned the Regulations as racially discriminatory, MacDonald defended them as necessary if the British were to fulfil the British Mandate Government's obligations to the Palestinians as well as to the Jews. A close look at the positions of each side reveals that their differences lay not in their abstract principles of justice but in the geographical imaginaries through which they viewed Palestine and the Palestinians.									0	0	0	0	0	0020-2754		WOS:000337678700002

The goal of this article is to explore how we might decentre this narrative and jointly consider elite and non-elite narratives, through an analysis of discourses of modernity as enacted in and through these statist urban projects. Deploying a practice-based analytic, I explore how notions of 'modernity' are performed and enacted through the exclusionary practices of elites and non-elites alike. Taking the case of Kazakhstan's new capital city, Astana, I examine how the state-led urban modernisation agenda simultaneously draws upon and re-inscribes a set of interlocking popular geographic imaginaries (Soviet/modern, urban/rural, north/south), and demonstrate how ordinary citizens are not just passive spectators, but active participants in the political drama of state-and city-building.									0	0	0	0	0	0020-2754		WOS:000337678700008		
J	Linehan, Denis								Irish Empire: assembling the geographical imagination of Irish missionaries in Africa								CULTURAL GEOGRAPHIES				21	3			429	447		10.1177/1474474013511037			JUL 2014	2014	Throughout the 20th century the books, exhibitions, public lectures, magazines, film and television shows produced by Irish missionaries created a vivid portrayal of Africa within Ireland. Until recently, so clearly were these missionary enterprises associated with an idea of Ireland as a champion of the Global South that their history and their rich visual and material culture existed beyond critique. This paper will contest this established national narrative, through an excavation of the geographical culture of Irish Catholic missionaries and their depictions of Africa between 1900 and 1940, when many of the principal imaginaries about the continent and its peoples were lodged in the Irish consciousness. To undertake this analysis, this paper will deploy concepts of assemblage rather than colonial discourse analysis, the method that has more frequently been used to consider the geographical imaginaries associated with the visual and material culture that intersects with colonialism. This proposition is derived from the contention that in presenting a fluid but materialized vision of society, attendant to the turbulent qualities of social, spatial and non-human relationships, assemblage creates illuminating opportunities to trace how knowledges about Africa were continuously transacted through the Irish missionary enterprise - in bodies, books, the built environment and so on, as well as through the immanent qualities of the missionary network itself. Assemblage offers the potential to re-situate 'the geographical' within missionary activities, by recognizing their dependency upon the circulation of information, materials and personnel over a wide network and through multiple modes of encounter and knowledge making. In this way, the paper contributes to the recasting of geography's history, though an exploration of the relationships between geographical practices and the contexts, practices and networks in which they have been situated. Equally, examination of the early 20th-century Catholic missionary enterprise offers critical insights into the complexities and dramas of Irishness in the context of Empire.									0	0	0	0	0	1474-4740		WOS:000337700800006		
J	McCusker, Maeve								The 'Unhomely' White Women of Antillean Writing								PARAGRAPH				37	2			273	289		10.3366/para.2014.0126			JUL 2014	2014	While the field known as 'Whiteness Studies' has been thriving in Anglophone criticism and theory for over 25 years, it is almost unknown in France. This is partly due to epistemological and political differences, but also to demographic factors-in contrast with the post-plantation culture of the US, for example, whites in Martinique and Guadeloupe are a tiny minority of small island populations. Yet 'whiteness' remains a phantasized and a fetishized state in the Antillean imaginary, and is strongly inflected by gender. This article sketches the emergence of 'white' femininity during slavery, then examines its representation in the work of a number of major Antillean writers (Conde, Placoly, Confiant, Chamoiseau). In their work, a cluster of recurring images and leitmotifs convey the idealization or, more commonly, the pathologization, of the white woman; these images resonate strongly with Bhabha's 'unhomely', and convey the disturbing imbrication of sex and race in Antillean history.									0	0	0	0	0	0264-8334		WOS:000337916800009

The analysis is based on theories of territorial systems, human territoriality, and power networks at the margins of the State. The document evaluates case studies of the Southern Cone and concludes that there are four territorial forms of activism in border conditions: 1) strategies aimed at obtaining public services in marginalized borders; 2) instrumentalization of the nationalist imaginary; 3) tactical use of borders, and, finally, 4) citizen management of the nationalist imaginary. Finally, the study questions the criminalization of border status and recognizes the legitimacy of activist networks in border regions.

J	Mallan, Kerry								Everything You Do: Young Adult Fiction and Surveillance in an Age of Security								INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH IN CHILDRENS LITERATURE				7	1			1	17		10.3366/ircl.2014.0110			JUL 2014	2014	Espionage, surveillance and clandestine operations by secret agencies and governments were something of an East-West obsession in the second half of the twentieth century, a fact reflected in literature and film. In the twenty-first century, concerns of the Cold War and the threat of Communism have been rearticulated in the wake of 9/11. Under the rubric of 'terror' attacks, the discourses of security and surveillance are now framed within an increasingly global context. As this article illustrates, surveillance fiction written for young people engages with the cultural and political tropes that reflect a new social order that is different from the Cold War era, with its emphasis on spies, counter espionage, brainwashing and psychological warfare. While these tropes are still evident in much recent literature, advances in technology have transformed the means of tracking, profiling and accumulating data on individuals' daily activities. Little Brother, The Hunger Games and Article 5 reflect the complex relationship between the real and the imaginary in the world of surveillance and, as this paper discusses, raise moral and ethical issues that are important questions for young people in our age of security.									0	0	0	0	0	1755-6198		WOS:000338772500002

It does this by comparing Cora Diamond's reading of J. M. Coetzee's novel The Lives of Animals with an imaginary reading of the same novel tuned to a moral sensibility closer to Deweyan pragmatism. By comparing a real account with an imaginary one, the article intends to press Diamond's perfectionist understanding of problematic moral experience into confrontation with a pragmatist account of the same phenomenon. This reading becomes the starting point for a broader confrontation between two larger philosophical conceptions: perfectionism and pragmatism. By this comparison, the article means to extend a dialogue begun more than a century ago, showing in particular that integrating both perspectives within a common moral epistemology provides new insights into our understanding of moral experience. The general claim is that their differences notwithstanding, perfectionism and pragmatism share a common moral sensibility, although they part ways on some decisive issues that the article makes explicit.									0	0	0	0	0	0026-1068		WOS:000338996300005

J	Kapyla, Juha; Kennedy, Denis								Cruel to care? Investigating the governance of compassion in the humanitarian imaginary								INTERNATIONAL THEORY				6	2			255	292		10.1017/S1752971914000025			JUL 2014	2014	Compassion is a key moral emotion of liberal modernity. Traditionally, it is seen as an unproblematic moral compass, both theoretically and ethico-politically. This applies especially in the case of humanitarian action, which hinges on the compassionate impulses of individuals - to care, to give and to act - in the face of distant suffering. The article takes a critical approach to compassion. It argues that humanitarian action is incomprehensible outside of a general theory of how compassion structures the encounter between the suffering object of relief and the caring public. It does this by elaborating a pragmatist and eclectic approach to compassion in which seemingly internal affective responses have a socio-political existence and are already enabled by productive power, in particular by socially circulated and embodied narrative frames. By engaging a representative sample of NGO imagery related to the 2010 post-earthquake response in Haiti, the article illustrates not only how specific narrative frames seek to both elicit and govern the ways of feeling compassion, but also how these aesthetic and emotional practices are ethico-politically problematic in portraying distant sufferers and facilitating action. As a result, the benevolent self-image of compassion becomes circumspect. The article concludes by exploring two alternative avenues for compassion and caring.									0	0	0	0	0	1752-9719		WOS:000339507800003		
J	Baranello, Micaela								Die lustige Witwe and the Creation of the Silver Age of Viennese Operetta								CAMBRIDGE OPERA JOURNAL				26	2			175	202		10.1017/S0954586714000032			JUL 2014	2014	Franz Lehar's Die lustige Witwe (1905) was conceived during a period of instability in both operetta and Viennese life. Considering the music and reception of both Witwe and some of its immediate, now-forgotten predecessors, this article argues that the operetta's dramatic and musical dualism between urbane, Offenbach-like Paris and folksy, imaginary Pontevedro can be read both as a response to operetta's conflicting priorities of satire and sentiment and as a depiction of the multi-ethnic world of working-class Vienna. The operetta's unusual popularity, subsequent influence and exceptionally long performance history have tended to obscure these more immediate concerns.									0	0	0	0	0	0954-5867		WOS:000340131100003

It explores the burden of colonial concepts and statist imaginaries in the shaping of objectified identities by Dalits, especially as they seize upon and crucially rework such categories. Critically engaging with the notion of coloniality, 'the other side of modernity', the article reveals the limits of categorical perspectives and intellectual theory in the articulation of social worlds. Instead, it points towards a global sociology that acknowledges and affirms ambivalence and contradiction as crucial attributes of thinking, writing and practice.									0	0	0	0	0	0011-3921		WOS:000340722400005		
J	Winder, Gordon M.; Schmitt, Michael								Geographical imaginaries in The New York Times' reports of the. assassinations of Mahatma Gandhi (1948) and Indira Gandhi (1984)								JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY				45				106	115		10.1016/j.jhg.2014.03.001			JUL 2014	2014	Geographical imaginaries are used by newspapers to interpret and make sense of foreign news, and to position their imagined readership in front of world events. Coverage in The New York Times of two notable assassinations in India is analyzed in order to compare and contrast the geographical imaginaries in use as each killing was constructed as a dramatic news story. Both assassinations were framed by a specific geopolitical context, the post-war reordering of the world in the case of Mohandas K. Gandhi, and the re-energized Cold War in the case of Indira Gandhi. This framing is reinforced by the globalized networks of news production used to report each event. While the analysis shows the expected narration of these events using Cold War narratives and terms, it also reveals shifting forms of Orientalism and civilization discourse at work, as well as ideas about terror, which demonstrate both the wide range of available framings and the variety of possible interpretations of these events. The paper argues that the geographical imaginaries used in this coverage cannot be read off a Cold War lexicon alone. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Mayer-Robin, Carmen								'L'heureuse aurore prochaine': From Narrative Vision in Emile Zola's Travail (1901) to Filmic Utopia in Henri Pouctal's Silent Film Adaptation (1920)								DIX-NEUF				18	2			150	168		10.1179/1478731814Z.00000000050			JUL 2014	2014	The first important French film of the 19205, according to Marcel Oms, was Henri Pouctal's silent adaptation of Emile Zola's Travail (19o1). Released in theatres on 16 January 1920, this cinematic fresco resembled other films of the post-war period as it focused on an imaginary, future France. The film was seen almost immediately in France's biggest cities, from Paris to the provinces. Despite its initial success, its legacy is not unlike that of the Zola novel on which it is based. Relegated to the archival debris of the Cinematheque francaise, until recently Pouctal's Travail could only be viewed on the editing bench at the Fort de Saint-Cyr. Neither the two-hour version, fully restored by Renee Lichtig in 1992, nor the unrestored eight-hour version in seven episodes, challenges the paternalism and pacifism evident in the novel and discussed by many of its earliest critics. Pouctal's Travail recapitulates, indeed, the utopianism of the blueprint text that inspired it, recasting Zola's apocalyptic turn-of-the-century vision into a post-war utopian dream. What we discover in a rereading of the novel through the filmic lens is a push and pull not just between original and copy, but, more importantly, between the ideological premise of Theureuse aurore prochaine', and the fictional or filmic applications of that premise in the fluctuating historical space separating 1901 from 1920, a dialogue which reveals the moving target of utopia.									0	0	0	0	0	1478-7318		WOS:000346130700003

It would be a compliment to the illusion, which could also be translated into the conception which says that the horizon is the deepest, or simply an recognition of the impossibility of reaching an essence of things, which would make unnecessary the classic division between essence and appearance, which, in Kantian terms that would resolve the dichotomy between phenomenon and thing in itself and in terms schopenhauerianos views of Will and Representation? But on the other hand, woldn't it be better to understand the concept of Will as a Real, to speak in Lacanian terms, which takes a bit of time, despite the endless representing? And the Representation as something that would encompass the categories of the Imaginary and the Symbolic, as we see prefigured in Freud's Beyond the Pleasure Principle?									0	0	0	0	0	0104-4443		WOS:000346126200013

By depicting the story of a famous folk heroine heralded as a patriotic figure by Sindh's most prominent nationalist leader, we contend that Umar Marvi contributed to the construction of a modern national imaginary for Sindhis in post-Partition Pakistan. This imaginary rests on a narrative that conceives Sindhis as a peaceful and syncretic folk culture continuously occupying the mythicized land of the Indus. We show that Umar Marvi takes part in this narrative by portraying a certain image of an idealized community and by representing a fixed, folklorized heritage while attempting to master cinema as the medium of modernity.									1	0	0	0	1	0974-9276		WOS:000347444600003

A Distant Contemporary: Indian Twentieth-Century Art in the Festival of India								ART BULLETIN				96	3			338	356		10.1080/00043079.2014.889529			JUL 3 2014	2014	In 1985-86, the Festival of India staged over seventy exhibitions in the United States in forty-two different states, emphasizing India's historical and vernacular traditions. Only three exhibitions presented "contemporary" Indian art, and while the term claimed a contemporaneity with the art of the northern Atlantic, these three shows simultaneously reified a geographic, temporal, and conceptual distance by pursuing a consistently introductory approach and by anchoring the work in the North American imaginary of India. The logic of the distant contemporary operates in the gallery contexts, curatorial choices, catalogs, and erasures of this exhibitionary moment.									0	0	0	0	0	0004-3079		WOS:000344372700005

Effects of social gaze on visual-spatial imagination								FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				5						671	10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00671			JUL 4 2014	2014	Previous research suggests that closing one's eyes or averting one's gaze from another person can benefit visual-spatial imagination by interrupting cognitive demands associated with face-to-face interaction (Markson and Paterson, 2009). The present study further investigated this influence of social gaze on adults' visual spatial imagination, using the matrix task (Kerr, 1987,1993). Participants mentally kept track of a pathway through an imaginary 2-dimensional (2D) or 3-dimensional (3D) matrix. Concurrent with this task, participants either kept their eyes closed or maintained eye contact with another person, mutual gaze with a person whose eyes were obscured(by wearing dark glasses), or unreciprocated gaze toward the face of a person whose own gaze was averted or whose face was occluded (by placing a paper bag over her head). Performance on the 2D task was poorest in the eye contact condition, and did not differ between the other gaze conditions, which produced ceiling performance. However, the more difficult 3D task revealed clear effects of social gaze. Performance on the 3D task was poorest for eye contact, better for mutual gaze, and equally better still for the unreciprocated gaze and eye-closure conditions. The findings reveal the especially disruptive influence of eye contact on concurrent visual-spatial imagination and a benefit for cognitively demanding tasks of disengaging eye contact during face-to-face interaction.									2	0	0	0	2	1664-1078		WOS:000338792500001	25071645	
J	Jamieson, Graham A.; Burgess, Adrian P.								Hypnotic induction is followed by state-like changes in the organization of EEG functional connectivity in the theta and beta frequency bands in high-hypnotically susceptible individuals								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				8						528	10.3389/fnhum.2014.00528			JUL 24 2014	2014	Altered state theories of hypnosis posit that a qualitatively distinct state of mental processing, which emerges in those with high hypnotic susceptibility following a hypnotic induction, enables the generation of anomalous experiences in response to specific hypnotic suggestions. If so then such a state should be observable as a discrete pattern of changes to functional connectivity (shared information) between brain regions following a hypnotic induction in high but not low hypnotically susceptible participants. Twenty-eight channel EEG was recorded from 12 high susceptible (highs) and 11 low susceptible (lows) participants with their eyes closed prior to and following a standard hypnotic induction. The EEG was used to provide a measure of functional connectivity using both coherence (COH) and the imaginary component of coherence (iCOH), which is insensitive to the effects of volume conduction. COH and iCOH were calculated between all electrode pairs for the frequency bands: delta (0.1-3.9 Hz), theta (4-7.9 Hz) alpha (8-12.9 Hz), beta1 (13-19.9 Hz), beta2 (20-29.9 Hz) and gamma (30-45 Hz). The results showed that there was an increase in theta iCOH from the pre-hypnosis to hypnosis condition in highs but not lows with a large proportion of significant links being focused on a central-parietal hub. There was also a decrease in beta1 iCOH from the pre-hypnosis to hypnosis condition with a focus on a fronto-central and an occipital hub that was greater in high compared to low susceptibles. There were no significant differences for COH or for spectral band amplitude in any frequency band. The results are interpreted as indicating that the hypnotic induction elicited a qualitative change in the organization of specific control systems within the brain for high as compared to low susceptible participants. This change in the functional organization of neural networks is a plausible indicator of the much theorized "hypnotic-state."									0	0	0	0	0	1662-5161		WOS:000340565500001	25104928

Through the identification, mapping and analysis of real and imaginary spaces, I analyse how rock occupied the city both materially and symbolically. This dual approach to the study of the production, circulation and consumption of rock music enables us to understand a paradox which spanned those formative years: although it was postulated as the genre of modern Buenos Aires, its aesthetic was geared towards constructing an anti-urban account that favoured escape towards idealized natural environments.									0	0	0	0	0	0963-9268		WOS:000338101300008

Moving beyond the fact that multimodality occurs, this paper focuses on how it occurs, with particular attention drawn to the complex network of perceptual, bodily and imaginary experiences of students. Through an analysis of 2 selected episodes of the work of 1 primary school child learning to graph motion, the paper shows how the notion of blending spaces is central to understanding the mechanism of multimodality.									0	0	0	0	0	1571-0068		WOS:000338782700010		
J	Maldjian, Joseph A.; Davenport, Elizabeth M.; Whitlow, Christopher T.								Graph theoretical analysis of resting-state MEG data: Identifying interhemispheric connectivity and the default mode								NEUROIMAGE				96				88	94		10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.03.065			AUG 1 2014	2014	Interhemispheric connectivity with resting state MEG has been elusive, and demonstration of the default mode network (DMN) yet more challenging. Recent seed-based MEG analyses have shown interhemispheric connectivity using power envelope correlations. The purpose of this study is to compare graph theoretic maps of brain connectivity generated using MEG with and without signal leakage correction to evaluate for the presence of interhemispheric connectivity.Eight minutes of resting state eyes-open MEG data were obtained in 22 normal male subjects enrolled in an IRB-approved study (ages 16-18). Data were processed using an in-house automated MEG processing pipeline and projected into standard (MNI) source space at 7 mm resolution using a scalar beamformer. Mean beta-band amplitude was sampled at 2.5 second epochs from the source space time series. Leakage correction was performed in the time domain of the source space beam formed signal prior to amplitude transformation. Graph theoretic voxel-wise source space correlation connectivity analysis was performed for leakage corrected and uncorrected data. Degree maps were thresholded across subjects for the top 20% of connected nodes to identify hubs. Additional degree maps for sensory, visual, motor, and temporal regions were generated to identify interhemispheric connectivity using laterality indices. Hubs for the uncorrected MEG networks were predominantly symmetric and midline, bearing some resemblance to fMRI networks. These included the cingulate cortex, bilateral inferior frontal lobes, bilateral hippocampal formations and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres. These uncorrected networks however, demonstrated little to no interhemispheric connectivity using the ROI-based degree maps. Leakage corrected MEG data identified the DMN, with hubs in the posterior cingulate and biparietal areas. These corrected networks demonstrated robust interhemispheric connectivity for the ROI-based degree maps. Graph theoretic analysis of MEG resting state data without signal leakage correction can demonstrate symmetric networks with some resemblance to fMRI networks. These networks however, are an artifact of high local correlation from signal leakage and lack interhemispheric connectivity. Following signal leakage correction, MEG hubs emerge in the DMN, with strong interhemispheric connectivity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A unique series of music outcomes and potential models reflecting a symbiosis of Malaysian and Western art music through composition and performance are emerging for instrument(s) and electronics. This paper focuses on the first and second phases of the project investigating Western flute, Malaysian serunai and pensol nose flute with electronics. Multi-stranded investigations of connections are identified within the conception, composition, realisation and reception of these works. Performer perspectives are given through two case studies. Our purpose is to illuminate understandings of intercultural connections, to begin to re-conceptualise cultural research paradigms, and to see what we can discover about performance contexts and engagement with individuals, cultures and traditions. The research is contextualised within the philosophical theories of Gadamer, Merleau-Ponty and Ingold. Investigating the role of technology in this context impels a discussion of how these elements generate a new, multifaceted environment, the space in which intercultural and performative understandings can emerge. This article focuses on how these performance contexts become a place for research and new understandings.									0	0	0	0	0	1355-7718		WOS:000338779600008

While some scholars have made similar arguments, none has laid out a theoretically rigorous understanding of the global imaginary. I first draw upon the work of Charles Taylor and Manfred Steger to better understand globalization as an imaginary, but find their work unable to explain how the global imaginary is produced. To ameliorate this deficiency, I turn to the work of Louis Althusser to theorize globalization as socially produced within particular material apparatuses that organize daily practices. I conclude by applying this theory to examine how the apparatus of the US university has transformed from an institution designed to produce a national imaginary to one producing the global imaginary.									0	0	0	0	0	1369-1481		WOS:000339014200009

But what of imaginary regulatory experiences-does simulated restraint elicit comparable lapses in self-control? Here we demonstrate such effects under theoretically tractable imagery conditions. Across 3 experiments, temporal, structural, and spatial components of mental simulation were observed to drive the efficacy of imaginary self-control. In Experiment 1, lapses in restraint (i. e., financial impulsivity) were more pronounced when imaginary regulation (i. e., dietary restraint) focused on an event in the near versus distant future. In Experiment 2, comparable effects (i. e., increased stereotyping) emerged when simulated self-control (i. e., emotional suppression) was imagined from a first-person (cf. third-person) visual perspective. In Experiment 3, restraint was diminished (i. e., increased risk taking) when self-regulation (i. e., action control) centered on an event at a near versus distant location. These findings further delineate the conditions under which mental simulation impacts core aspects of social-cognitive functioning.									0	0	0	0	0	0096-3445		WOS:000340296200025	24635189

Using Lefebvre's concept of social space we analyse the perceived, conceived and lived spaces that constitute the campus of Monash University Malaysia and its urban setting in the township of Bandar Sunway. Dramatically transformed from a disused mining site and showcased as a 'progressive' urban project, the township symbolises the Sunway Group's commercial success and political pragmatism in managing the dynamics of Malaysia's ethnicised political economy. The broader student experience suggests that the configurations of power that shape ethnic and class relations at the scale of the national are reproduced in the composition of the student body, in students' on-campus interactions and in the rhythms of their everyday lives within the township. By attending to the material, symbolic and imaginary dimensions of one international branch campus, we provide a more nuanced and textured understanding of the globalisation of higher education, highlighting different forms of agency exercised by key actors.									0	0	0	0	0	1360-7456		WOS:000340495400006		
J	Lewis, Nick; Kearns, Liam								'Educity imaginaries'? Escaping mobile policy imaginaries to reimagine educational futures in Auckland								ASIA PACIFIC VIEWPOINT				55	2	SI		196	211		10.1111/apv.12047			AUG 2014	2014	Over the last decade, international education initiatives and higher education restructuring in various parts of the world have been increasingly entangled with national knowledge economy policy and urban growth projects. The ensuing entanglements have been more or less 'policied' by what might be termed 'educity imaginaries', which have taken spectacular material form in some global cities. In this paper, we explore the working out of educity imaginaries in Auckland against the backdrop of shifting investment trajectories and the global mobility of educity policy. We argue that globalising imaginaries have intersected with local policy legacies and political economy to produce a mix of mundane and promissory imaginaries. We examine the frictions generated in these encounters and the ways in which they are reworked as resources in local city-making. Working from a commitment to enactive research, we argue that Auckland City might make much more of the possibilities opened up by 'educity imaginaries'.									0	0	0	0	0	1360-7456		WOS:000340495400007

This case study on overseas Chinese students and mainly non-Chinese foreign students studying at a top university in Taipei brings in the notions of cultural capital and city. It investigates the ways social networks shape the destination choices of these two groups of students, and how their patterns of adjustment in the host milieu and attachment to the host city are affected by the transnational migration network (and the lack of it), embodied cultural capital and different host imaginaries constructed by the Taiwan government. The results show that these two groups of international students differed in their reliance on transnational migration networks in making destination choices prior to migration. Furthermore, the different forms of social networks and the differential social and cultural capital embedded in their respective groups, along with the distinctive host images that were constructed by the Taiwan government to cater for these two groups, shaped their overseas experiences and attachment to the city of Taipei in distinctive ways.									0	0	0	0	0	1360-7456		WOS:000340495400009

It reflects on the genealogy of the concept and on the work it might perform in the world. At a time when the purpose and contribution of geography in schools is under question and the discipline is under severe strain at universities, we ask whether the idea of 'geographical imaginaries' offers a conceptual platform for demonstrating the potential for geography to offer meaning in the complex world of 21st-century New Zealand and whether it will help teachers to foster geographic thought in classrooms. In short, we argue for the merits of working with the idea of geographical imaginaries in classrooms and for utilising it to interrogate accounts of the geographical gaze and its values. This, we argue, offers opportunities to catalyse geographical thought, highlight the potential of thinking geographically, and open up a thinking space in which geography teachers can examine their pedagogy and enhance the purpose of their work. This would provide a platform for building a more imaginative and more politically and culturally relevant geography at school.									0	0	0	0	0	0028-8144		WOS:000340426700004

In order to transform the perspective of his reader, Rousseau throughout his works uses visual imagery and rhetorical devices invoking vision that represents both the correct view of human nature and virtue and the obstacles to learning to see ourselves properly. As a former engraver's apprentice, he was particularly interested in educating his reader through actual images such as frontispieces or illustrations. The aim of this article is to offer an interpretation of the engravings that illustrate Emile, or On Education, in order to investigate how Rousseau educates his reader through challenging the reader's preconceptions concerning human nature and replacing traditional exemplars of human nature and virtue with a new exemplar seen in his imaginary pupil.									0	0	0	0	0	0003-0554		WOS:000341091700004

According to such views, these and related emotions such as empathy, sympathy, and pity, can cause people to act righteously to aid others who are disadvantaged through no fault of their own. When applied to the contemporary issue of alleviating child poverty, it seems such emotions are both appropriate and easily developed through education. However, emotional appeals increasing a sense of urgency regarding such a dire issue should not necessarily be prioritized in the face of competing possibilities. Emotions can be difficult to develop, regulate, and sustain. Their appropriate expression and application in global contexts can be problematic, as people's valuation and understanding of feelings varies across societies. Additionally, there are tensions between discourses of emotional care and compassion and rational duty to social justice. This article examines competing views on education for understanding and responding to child poverty, and defends post-humanitarian imaginaries and the possibility of non-relational care ethics. Care, compassion, empathy, and emotion may be involved in learning about child poverty, but an a priori rational orientation is also essential in such grave matters of social injustice.									0	0	0	0	0	0013-1857		WOS:000342056300010

A large number of fifteenth- to sixteenth-century pre-Reformation panel paintings with a landscape context were studied in order to learn about their plant species, the contexts the plants were shown in, and their symbolism in connection to religious subjects. Paintings were studied in groups of 1) roadsides and execution sites and 2) fenced meadows, gardens and courtyards. In addition, the seasonality of depicted plants was observed in the scenes of the Passion cycle and in the scene of the Visitation. The realism of these landscapes was manifested in these pictures by showing plants growing in places they belonged to naturally or culturally, and in seasons of religious feasts that the paintings were connected with. However, this realism was not consistent, but combined with plant metaphors and symbols, neatly associated to the subject, and recognised by plants' overall frequency, placement, properties and naming. Plant names in late medieval and early modern herbals appeared to be a particularly good tool for understanding their possible meanings in paintings, assuming that the first question the late medieval viewer could have asked was: 'What is this?' The religious art of the period is rich in links between natural and cultural environments; from it we can learn about the diversity of past vegetation as well as the spirituality and poetics of the society.									0	0	0	0	0	0142-6397		WOS:000341635200008

This includes a widened notion of agency to the inclusion of more-than-human bodies (i.e. material agency) and a focus on daily practice and the embodied experience of place. Calling upon the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze, the author puts forward affective atmospheres as a post-humanist way of studying socio-spatial processes associated with place identity and the spatial imaginaries that animate planning activity. Recognising the co-constitutive nature of research and social worlds, the article offers a performative methodology that situates researchers directly within the material and discursive environments they seek to investigate.									0	0	0	0	0	1473-0952		WOS:000342809600001

From this experience, arises the problem of the appropriateness of the conception of knowledge in the educational proposal. Thus, this qualitative, interpretative research focuses on the knowledge conception and its appropriateness in the education of these leaders, and its unit of analysis is the Program itself. Based on the empirical discussion that arises from the voices of the actors, on the institutional documents and the theorical discussion that comes from them, the imaginaries about knowledge are reported.

J	Kahn, Miriam								"Invest In Your Love": Romantic desires, YouTube videos, and the online marketing of Tahiti								TOURIST STUDIES				14	2			144	167		10.1177/1468797614532181			AUG 2014	2014	In this article, I explore the relationship between evolving technologies of image production, different kinds of desire, and how Tahiti is marketed as a tourist destination. I focus the discussion on an award-winning online contest, "Invest In Your Love," which Tahiti Tourisme North America launched to encourage tourism in the wake of the 2008 worldwide economic crisis. Little has changed over the centuries in the dominant Western image of Tahiti as an exotic paradise, although how that paradise is interpreted is influenced by personal and historical situations. What has changed, however, is that viewers can now manipulate the images to express their personal perceptions, dreams, and desires. By encouraging viewers to create their own image of paradise, and to engage in imaginary travel and self-transformation, the " Invest In Your Love" contest cleverly played with blurring boundaries between various categories as well as kinds of desire. This was seen not only between categories such as producer and consumer, here and there, and private dreams and public videos, but also between love and money, and professing love for one's partner and love for a brand. I explore these contemporary trends and the entanglements between categories by bringing together ideas and perspectives from two fields not usually joined in conversation; namely, cultural anthropology, and brand marketing.									0	0	0	0	0	1468-7976		WOS:000344194800003		
J	Canosa, Antonia								The role of travel and mobility in processes of identity formation among the Positanesi								TOURIST STUDIES				14	2			182	202		10.1177/1468797614532183			AUG 2014	2014	This article is based on an ethnographic study of the community of Positano on the Amalfi Coast in the south of Italy. It examines how the flows of visiting tourists have shaped the economy, lifestyle and rhythms of this small but world-famous tourist destination. Through visual imagery and narratives, I explore how residents of the community create meaningful identities amidst the continuous flux and flow of people arriving and departing. The article builds on the concepts of travel and mobility as underlying features in postmodern societies and as vehicles of identity formation among residents in tourist destinations. The findings illustrate how tourism has transformed the locality of Positano into a network of networks, and has thrust the inhabitants of this small coastal village into the global economy. The research also explores some of the intergenerational differences among older and younger residents that are exacerbated by the changes brought about by tourism. Reflecting on my role as an anthropologist doing research 'at home', the article seeks to contribute to the growing field of the anthropology of tourism.									0	0	0	0	0	1468-7976		WOS:000344194800005		
J	Mottweiler, Candice M.; Taylor, Marjorie								Elaborated Role Play and Creativity in Preschool Age Children								PSYCHOLOGY OF AESTHETICS CREATIVITY AND THE ARTS				8	3			277	286		10.1037/a0036083			AUG 2014	2014	Elaborated role play (i.e., pretending in which children imagine and act out the part of another individual on a regular basis) is often considered an early indicator of creativity, but there is not strong research evidence of a relation between this type of pretend play and performance on creativity tasks during the preschool years. One possible reason is that the measures of creativity that are commonly used are not appropriate for young children. To address this, we developed 2 new measures of creativity based on a storytelling task, in which children were asked to complete a story, and a drawing task, in which children were asked to draw an imaginary person. Of the 75 4- and 5-year-old children who participated, those who engaged in elaborated role play had higher creativity scores on both measures (controlling for age and language ability). In contrast, children's performance on a measure of pretend play development that did not involve imaginary others (i.e., the action pantomime task) was not related to either measure of creativity. These results suggest that the storytelling and drawing measures were effective in assessing children's creativity, and that they were specifically associated with elaborated role play, rather than the developmental level of children's ability to pretend.									0	0	0	0	0	1931-3896		WOS:000345153000003

J	Sugata, Hisato; Hirata, Masayuki; Yanagisawa, Takufumi; Shayne, Morris; Matsushita, Kojiro; Goto, Tetsu; Yorifuji, Shiro; Yoshimine, Toshiki								Alpha band functional connectivity correlates with the performance of brain-machine interfaces to decode real and imagined movements								FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE				8						620	10.3389/fnhum.2014.00620			AUG 8 2014	2014	Brain signals recorded from the primary motor cortex (M1) are known to serve a significant role in coding the information brain machine interfaces (BMIs) need to perform real and imagined movements, and also to form several functional networks with motor association areas. However, whether functional networks between M1 and other brain regions, such as these motor association areas, are related to the performance of BMIs is unclear. To examine the relationship between functional connectivity and performance of BMIs, we analyzed the correlation coefficient between performance of neural decoding and functional connectivity over the whole brain using magnetoencephalography. Ten healthy participants were instructed to execute or imagine three simple right upper limb movements. To decode the movement type, we extracted 40 virtual channels in the left M1 via the beam forming approach, and used them as a decoding feature. In addition, seed-based functional connectivities of activities in the alpha band during real and imagined movements were calculated using imaginary coherence. Seed voxels were set as the same virtual channels in M1. After calculating the imaginary coherence in individuals, the correlation coefficient between decoding accuracy and strength of imaginary coherence was calculated over the whole brain. The significant correlations were distributed mainly to motor association areas for both real and imagined movements. These regions largely overlapped with brain regions that had significant connectivity to M1. Our results suggest that use of the strength of functional connectivity between M1 and motor association areas has the potential to improve the performance of BMIs to perform real and imagined movements.									0	0	0	0	0	1662-5161		WOS:000340708600001	25152729

This article examines how this city was used both to communicate particular memories of war experience and to lay down future patterns of remembrance. Processes of eyewitnessing, establishing the wider meaning of war, creating a warrior tradition and affirming the value of location or place were all ways in which war memory was articulated during the crusading period. Through an exploration of crusader encounters with the city of Damietta, this article offers some new insights into the nature and importance of medieval memory and remembrance of war.									0	0	0	0	0	0304-4181		WOS:000338723900008		
J	Vargas, Jennifer Harford								Dictating a Zafa: The Power of Narrative Form in Junot Diaz's The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao								MELUS				39	3			8	30		10.1093/melus/mlu034			FAL 2014	2014	Junot Diaz's novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao (2007) plays on the tensions between the two definitions of dictate: on the one hand, to order or command authoritatively and absolutely and, on the other hand, to speak aloud words that are to be written down or transcribed. This article argues that the novel's narrative techniques and formal structures dictate, or tell, a story against dictatorship, analyzing how the novel manipulates the character-system and modes of narration to resist oppressive domination. First, I explicate how the novel marginalizes and parodies the dictator and centralizes socially marginalized characters in the overall narrative structure to challenge authoritarian power and hegemonic discourses. Subsequently, I demonstrate how the novel mobilizes underground storytelling modes-specifically hearsay, footnotes, and silences-formally to represent and critique the dissemination and repression of information under dictatorship. I end by situating The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao in an emerging set of dictatorship novels written by Latina/os, arguing that contemporary Latino authors such as Diaz are generating a counter-dictatorial imaginary rooted in intersectional analyses of authoritarianism, racial domination, heteropatriarchy, and imperialism in the hemisphere.									0	0	0	0	0	0163-755X		WOS:000339922500002

Beyond the Ghetto: Police Power, Methamphetamine and the Rural War on Drugs								CRITICAL CRIMINOLOGY				22	3			339	355		10.1007/s10612-013-9218-z			SEP 2014	2014	Viewing police as important cultural producers, we ask how police power fashions structures of feeling and social imaginaries of the "war on drugs" in small towns of the rural Midwest. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and a collection of interviews focusing on police officers' beliefs about the causes of crime and drug use, we locate a narrative of rural decline attributed to the producers and users of methamphetamine. We argue this narrative supports punitive and authoritarian sensibilities and broader narcopolitical projects more generally and ignores long-standing social inequalities observed in rural communities. As such, the cultural work of rural police provides important insight to the shape and direction of late-modern crime control beyond the familiar terrains of the city and its "ghetto.".									1	0	0	0	1	1205-8629		WOS:000340088000002		
J	Trauger, Amy								Is Bigger Better? The Small Farm Imaginary and Fair Trade Banana Production in the Dominican Republic								ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS				104	5			1082	1100					SEP 2014	2014	Fair Trade is a certification system designed to create social change in production and consumption patterns, primarily in agricultural products, by shaping what happens on the production end of the supply chain through a certification and regulatory system. Previous research on Fair Trade investigated the workings and benefits of Fair Trade production models, with little attention paid to how the Fair Trade model might fail to meet its objectives. Research on Fair Trade would suggest that if inequality and exploitation exist in the Fair Trade supply chain, it would be experienced by the most marginalized actors, such as the temporary workers hired by smallhold farmers, who are frequently invisible in the Fair Trade literature and documents on banana production in the Caribbean. Through a global ethnography of the organic and Fair Trade banana supply chain in the Dominican Republic, this research reveals how Fair Trade as a "spatial fix" for capital and a "small farm imaginary" work to marginalize a particular class of workers. It also reveals the unseen sociality of Fair Trade standards in the systemic and structural assumptions in the small farm production model that Fair Trade promotes. The study finds that smallhold workers are essential to sustaining the market for Fair Trade bananas in a form of functional dualism between smallholders and plantations. In a counterintuitive outcome of the workings of Fair Trade, workers might be better off in the medium-scale plantation model unique to the Dominican Republic.									0	0	0	0	0	0004-5608		WOS:000340411800011		
J	Blackmore, Lisa								CAPTURE LIFE: THE 'DOCUMENT - MONUMENT' IN RECENT COMMEMORATIONS OF HUGO CHAVEZ								JOURNAL OF LATIN AMERICAN CULTURAL STUDIES				23	3			235	250		10.1080/13569325.2014.922940			SEP 2014	2014	The recent passing of Hugo Chavez, president of Venezuela from 1999 till 2013, produced a juncture in the nation's imaginary that immediately sparked numerous and diverse commemorative practices. This article explores this sudden demand for a coherent and enduring memory of the late president by analysing different official postures and commemorative strategies. These are initially placed in the context of key historiographical tropes of the Bolivarian Revolution, and then analysed in light of such tropes. Specifically, the discussion identifies a thirst for documents', used in the broad sense proposed by Jacques Le Goff, which converged on the presidential body, the social body and public space as potential stimuli for memory. In this context, the initial possibilities of embalming Chavez's body, free tattoos of his signature and its use to decorate government buildings, appeal to the archive as a source of authority and as the commencement of history, as Jacques Derrida has it, while extrapolating the president's signature as a mobile and reproducible image of power to seek the eternal presence of the lider eterno' (eternal leader) as an anchor for political unity.									0	0	0	0	0	1356-9325		WOS:000340380600002

The analysis of qualitative data collection in research on gender violence is essential to prevent the reproduction of stereotypes and to induce transformation through research. This article is focused on the communicative analysis, which identifies for each category analyzed an exclusionary dimension (that promotes gender violence) and a transformative one (that contributes to preventive socialization of gender violence). Although in our studies we identify rivalry among women as an element of the exclusionary dimension, at the same time, we identify solidarity among women as an element of the transformative dimension. This solidarity breaks with stereotypes of "natural" female rivalry and stands out as one key element to overcome gender violence.									0	0	0	0	0	1077-8004		WOS:000340420800009		
J	Key, Newton								The "Boast of Antiquity": Pulpit Politics Across the Atlantic Archipelago during the Revolution of 1688								CHURCH HISTORY				83	3			618	649		10.1017/S0009640714000584			SEP 2014	2014	John Locke and many others noted the vibrant political commentary emanating from the pulpit during the Glorious Revolution. Preachers from the full confessional spectrum in England, and especially in Scotland, Ireland, and the colonies, used occasional or state sermons to explain contemporary upheavals from the perspective of God's law, Natural law, and Civil law. Most surprising is the latter, clerical reference to civil history and ancient origins, which preachers used to answer contemporary questions of conquest and allegiance. Clergy revisited the origins and constitutional roots of the Britons, Anglo-Saxons, Scots, and Irish, and deployed histories of legendary kings and imaginary conquests to explain and justify the revolutionary events of 1688-1692. Sermons of this revolutionary era focused as much on civil as on sacred history, and sought their true origins in antiquity and the mists of myth. Episcopalian preachers, whether Church of Ireland, Scottish Episcopalian, or Church of England, seem to have been especially inspired by thanksgiving or fast days memorialized in the liturgical calendar to ponder the meaning of a deep historical narrative. Scots, Irish, and Massachusetts clergy claimed their respective immemorialism, as much as the English did theirs. But, as they re-stated competing Britannic constitutions and origin myths explicitly, they exposed imperial rifts and contradictions within the seemingly united claim of antiquity. By the beginning of the next reign and century, state sermons depended more upon reason and less upon a historicized mythic antiquity.									0	0	0	0	0	0009-6407		WOS:000340566400004		
J	Fleer, Marilyn								The demands and motives afforded through digital play in early childhood activity settings								LEARNING CULTURE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION				3	3	SI		202	209		10.1016/j.lcsi.2014.02.012			SEP 2014	2014	In drawing upon cultural-historical concepts this paper examines the demands that children meet when digital tablet technology is introduced during free play in early childhood settings. In particular, this paper reveals how an iPad and movie making program create new demands on children that afford a new relation between play and learning. Through analyses of video observations of children in one child care center in Australia it was found that how children respond to the new demands depends upon their motive orientation as they engage with tablet technology. The concept of flickering is introduced to capture how the microgenetic movement between collective and individual imagining in an activity occurs, between being in and out of an imaginary situation, and between concrete objects and virtual representations.

Its subjective phenomenology can be described by three aspects: intentions, motivations, and interactions. In this article, we present a typology of the possible intentions. We identified nine different (ideal) types of intentions that WTD statements might have, other than wishing to live and accepting death. Many WTD statements do not imply a desire to hasten death. The intentions of statements differ according to whether a WTD is related to as imaginary or as an action. Often WTD statements contain several partial wishes, which can be in tension with each other and form a dynamic, sometimes unstable equilibrium.Conclusions: Terminally ill persons' WTD statements differ in their intention, and deeper knowledge about these differences is ethically relevant.

J	Kim, Sang-Hyun								The Politics of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research in South Korea: Contesting National Sociotechnical Imaginaries								SCIENCE AS CULTURE				23	3			293	319		10.1080/09505431.2013.860095			SEP 2014	2014	To many commentators outside South Korea, the Hwang Woo Suk scandal involving human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research was just another spectacular case of misconduct in the life sciences. As such, it is generally assumed to have revealed the drawbacks of research in scientifically and ethically less-developed societies. Such thinking ignores the history, sophistication, and distinctive features of the public debate over hESC research in South Korea. Disputes over the social and ethical implications of hESC research had taken place for some time before the scandal erupted. Moreover, unlike in some other countries, where resistance to hESC research was prompted by religious conservatives, the most serious critique of the country's rapid move into the field came from progressive social movement activists-including feminists and environmentalists. These activists were, in fact, part of the non-governmental organization coalition to impose stricter social controls on biotechnology. This campaign was motivated by broader political and social concerns beyond specific biosafety or bioethical issues. The activists involved in the coalition feared that the capitalist-developmentalist drive toward biotechnology would threaten the public interest and democracy, and ultimately block South Korea's road to becoming a democratic nation founded on the values of social justice, equality, participation, and sustainability. In contesting South Korea's prevailing approaches to hESC research, they challenged, albeit unsuccessfully, the dominant 'national sociotechnical imaginary' that articulates the role of science and technology in relation to the future survival and well-being of the nation primarily in terms of its industrial competitiveness.									1	0	0	0	1	0950-5431		WOS:000340996900001		
J	Pires, Eloiza Gurgel								Experiência e linguagem em Walter Benjamin	Experience and language in Walter Benjamin							Educação e Pesquisa				40	3			813	828		10.1590/s1517-97022014041524			2014-09	2014	This article presents a reflection about the Benjamin's theory of language. Walter Benjamin, german philosopher and literary critic in the early decades of the twentieth century produced a landmark study in which language can not be considered as a mere instrument of compilers of reality nor as simple abstraction, but is designed as a field in which emerges an intricate network of relationships between knowledge and experience. For the philosopher, the language is the spiritual medium and historical experience. The concept of Erfahrung (experience) runs through all his work: youth from a text written in 1913, entitled Erfahrung (1933), in which the author disputes the disaffection of youth enthusiasm on behalf of the experience of adults, the theses 1940 . This concept is closely related in his writings, the thought that all human manifestations and expressions can be designed as a language, and this, in turn, is then designed in its symbolic dimension, unlike the philosophers who wanted clarification when indicated, as a condition for true knowledge, a rationality that separated the imaginary thinking. Contrary scientific Enlightenment thought, the aesthetic paradigm is essential in benjaminianos writings. From the host of the concept in the image show up new ways of knowing. In this perspective , we attempt to discuss the thought of Benjamin showing joints and ruptures engendered with problematizations formed from existing connections between language and experience and their relation to the education field.		Este artigo apresenta uma reflexão a respeito da teoria da linguagem benjaminiana. Walter Benjamin, filósofo e crítico literário alemão, nas primeiras décadas do século XX, produziu um estudo decisivo no qual a linguagem não pode ser considerada como mero instrumento de elaboração dos dados da realidade nem como simples abstração, mas é pensada como campo no qual emerge uma intrincada rede de relações entre conhecimento e experiência. Para o filósofo, a linguagem é o médium espiritual e histórico da experiência. O conceito de Erfahrung (experiência) atravessa toda a sua obra: desde um texto de juventude, escrito em 1913, intitulado Erfahrung (1933), em que o autor contesta o desinteresse dos entusiasmos juvenis em nome da experiência dos adultos, às teses de 1940. Esse conceito está intrinsecamente relacionado, em seus escritos, ao pensamento de que todas as manifestações e expressões humanas podem ser concebidas como linguagem e, essa, por sua vez, é então pensada na sua dimensão simbólica, ao contrário do que pretendiam os filósofos do esclarecimento quando apontavam, como condição para o verdadeiro conhecimento, uma racionalidade que separava o imaginário do pensamento. Na contramão do pensamento iluminista científico, o paradigma estético é fundamental nos escritos benjaminianos. A partir do acolhimento do conceito na imagem, evidenciam-se novas formas de conhecer. Nessa perspectiva, tentaremos discutir o pensamento de Benjamin mostrando as articulações e rupturas engendradas com as problematizações constituídas a partir das conexões existentes entre linguagem e experiência e sua relação com o campo educativo.							0	0	0	0	0	1517-9702		SCIELO:S1517-97022014000300015

Situating this analysis in the context of the capitalist crisis of the mid-1970s, the article discusses the politics of effacement that in Argentina's case paved the way for the use of monetary policy as a form of social control intended to embed the nation-state into global capitalism. Examining economic legislation, macroeconomic policies, political ideologies, consumer discourses and pension privatization, I analyse how the neoliberal monetary regime ideologically underpinned a whole state imaginary based on exchange rate parity with the US dollar. Further, I investigate the ideological function of money in symbolically reordering the relationships of workers and citizens to the state, capital and culture. The article concludes with an exploration of the political significance of the monetary collapse of the Argentine neoliberal reform in 2001-2002, comparing Argentina's crisis of hegemony with that of other states within global capitalism.									0	0	0	0	0	0950-2386		WOS:000341637600003

This article asserts that, in the EU's spatial planning, the cluster is increasingly part of a hybrid spatial politics, here named the cluster gaze', based on the interplay of innovation-oriented political rationality and spatial governance. To study this process, the article provides an empirical investigation into selected EU documentation. The investigation is based on two perspectives. First, the cluster is analysed as a mediating instrument to stimulate and rescale transnational market developments in the EU. Second, the cluster is studied as an instrument of spatial management one that builds on a business managerial ethos and endorses a specific hierarchical spatial imaginary and a cluster evidence base to assess the productivity and efficiency of European clusters. Both of these perspectives pave the way for a European politics of cluster excellence' that is about the constant sharpening of cluster practices, continuous evaluation and ranking, and the enhancement of cluster performance to rise from the European league' towards the world class'.									0	0	0	0	0	0309-1317		WOS:000341681900011		
J	Lee, Tsung-Chin								Trilogy of Body Imaginary: Dance/Movement Therapy for a Psychiatric Patient with Depression								ARTS IN PSYCHOTHERAPY				41	4			400	408		10.1016/j.aip.2014.07.006			SEP 2014	2014	The purpose of this study is to discuss the application of dance/movement therapy to the case of Chun-Li, a 56-year-old woman diagnosed with major depression with psychotic features, and underscore the relevance of psychic meanings to the treatment process. The treatment consisted of three phases: phase one was focused on building the therapeutic relationship with Chun-Li through regimens and health-enhancing exercise that are rooted in Taiwanese folklore; in phase two, she was encouraged to pay attention to her body and make verbal interpretations in relation to her movements; and phase three was intended to help her embody the inner imagination, making contact with her inner conflict and revealing her traumatic event. In this paper, three aspects of the casework are discussed and related to the theories and practices of dance movement therapy: (1) the bodily relationship in ballroom dance; (2) the effect of the partnership in ballroom dance on Chun-Li; and (3) the imagination invoked by a moving body in dance. This article attempts to explain the meanings of significant body experience and body knowledge development through the transformation of the body. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Biruk, Crystal								'Aid for gays': the moral and the material in 'African homophobia' in post-2009 Malawi								JOURNAL OF MODERN AFRICAN STUDIES				52	3			447	473		10.1017/S0022278X14000226			SEP 2014	2014	In recent years, 'African homophobia' has become a spectacle on the global stage, making Africa into a pre-modern site of anti-gay sentiment in need of Western intervention. This article suggests that 'homophobia' in post-2009. Malawi is an idiom through which multiple actors negotiate anxieties around governance and moral and economic dependency. I illustrate the material conditions that brought about social imaginaries of inclusion and exclusion partially expressed through homophobic discourse - in Malawi. The article analyses the cascade of events that led to a moment of political and economic crisis in mid-2011, with special focus on how a 2009 sodomy case made homophobia available as a new genre of social commentary. Employing discourse analysis of newspaper articles, political speeches, the proceedings of a sodomy case, and discussions about men who have sex with men (MSM) as an HIV risk group, I show how African homophobia takes form via interested deployments of 'cultural' rhetoric toward competing ends. This article lends a comparative case study to a growing literature on the political and social functions of homophobia in sub-Saharan Africa.									0	0	0	0	0	0022-278X		WOS:000342220600005		
J	Popescu, Monica								On the Margins of the Black Atlantic: Angola, the Eastern Bloc, and the Cold War								RESEARCH IN AFRICAN LITERATURES				45	3			91	109					FAL 2014	2014	In this essay, I set in dialogue a documentary film, Abderrahmane Sissako's Rostov-Luanda (1997), and a novel, Mongane Wally Serote's Scatter the Ashes and Go (2002), to examine the role of the war in Angola in the cultural imaginary of African intellectuals. Angola was the site of one of the hot conflicts of the Cold War; yet it evokes not only tensions between the superpowers, but also political solidarities and cultural alliances that incorporate and go beyond the black Atlantic. These texts show that the Eastern Bloc is a constitutive part of the contemporary diasporic routes taken by black intellectuals. By taking into account diasporas routed through the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War, these texts also expand and modify the conceptual tools and theoretical perspectives of black Atlantic and postcolonial studies.									0	0	0	0	0	0034-5210		WOS:000342404700006		
J	Page, Ben								And the Oscar Goes to... Daybreak in Udi': Understanding Late Colonial Community Development and its Legacy through Film								DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE				45	5	SI		838	868		10.1111/dech.12119			SEP 2014	2014	This article analyses the 1949 film Daybreak in Udi and the influential ideas of its star' Edward Rowland Chadwick, a District Officer, with a view to understanding the legacy of the colonial policy of Community Development in Eastern Nigeria and Cameroon. The film, which is freely available online, follows an African community using self-help' methods to construct a rural maternity home. It helps visualize the colonial practices of mass education' and community betterment' but is not just a drama-documentary: it is also an argument in favour of community development. The article argues that Chadwick's ideas had a profound influence within the region where he worked, and that colonial community development more generally provides a key source for participatory development'. The film also discloses a late colonial socio-geographical imaginary', articulated through a hierarchy of specific social categories (administrative officers, teachers, peasants, elders, women and troublemakers), spatial locations (urban, rural) and the distinctions between them (modern/reactionary, leader/worker, audible/silent). The article shows that colonial community development not only played an important role in fixing these categories within subsequent development thinking, but that it also ran up against one of the ongoing paradoxes of self-help development', namely that it usually requires an outsider.									0	0	0	0	0	0012-155X		WOS:000342672300002		
J	VanderHill, M. S.; Wolf, E. E.; Langenderfer, J. E.; Ustinova, K. I.								The effect of actual and imaginary handgrip on postural stability during different balance conditions								GAIT & POSTURE				40	4			652	657		10.1016/j.gaitpost.2014.07.015			SEP 2014	2014	The stabilizing effect of holding an object on upright posture has been demonstrated in a variety of settings. The mechanism of this effect is unknown but could be attributed to either additional sensorimotor activity triggered by a hand contact or cognitive efforts related to performance of a supra-postural task. A potential mechanism was investigated by comparing postural stability in young healthy individuals while gripping a custom instrumented wooden stick with a 5N force and while imagining holding the same stick in the hand. Twenty subjects were tested during three standing balance conditions: on a stationary surface, on a freely moving rockerboard, and with an unexpected perturbation of 108 forward rockerboard tipping. Postural stability was evaluated as velocity of the center of mass (COM) and center of pressure (COP) compared across all experimental conditions. COM and COP velocities were equally reduced when subjects gripped the stick and imagined gripping while standing stationary and on the rockerboard. When perturbed, subjects failed to show any postural stability improvements regardless of handgrip task. Results indicate a stabilizing effect of focusing attention on motor task performance. This cognitive strategy does not appear to contribute any additional stabilization when subjects are perturbed. This study adds to the current understanding of postural stabilization strategies.

However, many social scientists regard such a person as a mere imaginary creature. We found that 31 of 446 residents of relatively wealthy Tokyo suburbs met the behavioral definition of Homo economicus. In several rounds of economic games, participants whose behavior was consistent with this model always apportioned the money endowed by the experimenter to themselves, leaving no share for their partners. These participants had high IQs and a deliberative decision style. An additional 39 participants showed a similar disregard for other people's welfare, although they were slightly more altruistic than those in the Homo economicus group. The psychological composition of these quasi-Homo economicus participants was distinct from that of participants in the Homo economicus group. Although participants in the latter group behaved selfishly on the basis of rational calculations, those in the former group made selfish choices impulsively. The implications of these findings concerning the two types of extreme noncooperators are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0956-7976		WOS:000342923600005	25037961	
J	Safransky, Sara								Greening the urban frontier: Race, property, and resettlement in Detroit								GEOFORUM				56				237	248		10.1016/j.geoforum.2014.06.003			SEP 2014	2014	In 2014, approximately 100,000 lots lie "vacant" in Detroit after decades of industrial decline, white flight, and poverty. Planners and government officials have proposed to repurpose Detroit's highest vacancy neighborhoods, deemed to have "no market value," as blue and green infrastructure (retention ponds, carbon forests, urban farms, greenways). According to the Detroit Future City plan, traditional public services (water, street lights, transportation, garbage pickup) and the "grey infrastructures" that deliver them will be reduced and eventually withdrawn from these zones. While Detroit is widely touted for its potential as a model green city, the costs and benefits of green redevelopment are distributed unevenly within the context of gentrification and bankruptcy. Through an analysis of media representations, a contentious citywide planning project, and the construction of a private urban forest, I demonstrate how settler colonial imaginaries and rationalities articulate with austerity measures to prepare a postindustrial urban frontier for resettlement and reinvestment. During the historical era of U.S. settler colonialism, economic development happened through westward expansion on a continental scale (and then imperial scale), but today, in the urban United States, it occurs through internal differentiation of previously developed spaces and is taking a new form. Where the rural settlers of the 19th century sought to conquer wilderness, "urban pioneers" in the 21st century deploy nature as a tool of economic development in a city with a shrinking population and a large spatial footprint. Yet accumulation by green dispossession still turns on some of the defining features of settler colonialism, e.g., private property as a civilizing mechanism on the frontier, the appropriation of collective land and resources, and the expendability of particular people and places. The production of this new urban frontier also depends, like any frontier, on erasure: the material and discursive work of presenting "empty" landscapes as in need of improvement by non-local actors. I argue that understanding the stakes of postindustrial urban development struggles requires attention to how concepts of (white) settler society which have been absorbed into political and legal-juridical institutions, discourses, myths, symbols, and national metaphors are used to claim "wild" and "empty" lands like those in Detroit.

Ricoeur's goal was to envisage the imagination not as a psychological faculty but as a semantic power. Metaphor and narrative allow us to see the real in a different way, hence to imagine it. The image has less to do with perception and concepts. It is the instrument that allows them to be articulated. This shift of the imaginary to the practical dimension is confirmed in Ricoeur's theory of ideology and utopia.									0	0	0	0	0	0031-8256		WOS:000343019400002

It begins with the story of Mahomet Weyonomon, a Mohegan sachem who traveled to London in 1736 to present a land-rights petition to George II but who died of smallpox before he could complete his task. Two hundred seventy years later, the Mohegan Tribe, with the help of Elizabeth II, unveiled a monument to Mahomet at Southwark Cathedral. Oscillating between his story and wider questions related to monument, memory, and commemoration, this short essay argues for a reconsideration of what constitutes the spaces of indigenous history, moving beyond traditional territories and topics to include urban areas, metropoles, vernacular spaces, and the settler imaginary.									0	0	0	0	0	0014-1801		WOS:000344444000001

Tainted Commons, Public Health: The Politico-Moral Significance of Cholera in Vietnam								MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY				28	3			342	361		10.1111/maq.12069			SEP 2014	2014	In October 2007, a series of cholera epidemics broke out in Hanoi, interrupting a moment of economic triumphalism in post-transition Vietnam. In seeking the source of a refractory disease associated with poverty and underdevelopment, officials, media, and citizens not only identified scapegoats and proposed solutions, they also endorsed particular visions of moral conduct, social order, and public health. Controversy over cholera, a potent politico-moral symbol, expressed an imaginary of "tainted commons" (i. e., an emergent space of civil society and small-scale entrepreneurship from which the state has partially withdrawn, while still exercising some measure of scrutiny and control). The ambiguities of this situation permitted the state to assume moral postures, evade responsibility, and deflect criticism to convenient targets. Prevalent outbreak narratives thus played on anxieties regarding specifically classed and gendered social groups, whose behavior was imagined to contravene ideals of public health and order.									0	0	0	0	0	0745-5194		WOS:000345912900012	24474525

The argument proceeds through three stages: first, I contextualize the cannibal as a stock image in Western thought, one that Humboldt inherits even before his journey to South America. Second, I examine this over-determined image, a veritable fixation in the European imaginary, against the claim advanced in recent Humboldt scholarship that he took the novel step of asking the cannibals to speak for themselves. Finally, I propose a reading of Humboldt's image of cannibalism as a politically charged picture of social relations, which simultaneously resists and reproduces the ideologically structured representation of indigenous peoples that Humboldt attempts to subvert.									0	0	0	0	0	0016-8831		WOS:000346157300006		
J	Ruse, Michael								Was there a Darwinian Revolution? Yes, no, and maybe!								ENDEAVOUR				38	3-4			159	168		10.1016/j.endeavour.2014.10.002			SEP-DEC 2014	2014	Was there a Darwinian Revolution and was it but part of the Scientific Revolution? Before Thomas Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions in 1962, most people thought that there was a Darwinian Revolution, that it was in some sense connected to the Scientific Revolution, but that neither question nor answer was terribly interesting. Then revolutions in science became a matter of intense debate, not so much about their very existence but about their nature. Was there a switch in world-views? Did the facts change? What was the importance of social groups? And so forth. Recently however some students of the history of science have started to argue that the very questions are misconceived and that there cannot have been a Darwinian Revolution and its relationship to the Scientific Revolution is imaginary because there are no such revolutions in science! This paper takes a sympathetic look at these issues, concluding that there is still life in the revolution-in-science issue, that Kuhn's book was seminal and still has things of importance to say, but that matters are more complex and more interesting than we thought back then.									0	0	0	0	0	0160-9327		WOS:000346665800001		
J	Glodeanu, Gheorghe								Two Masters of Fantastic Prose Ion Agarbiceanu and E. T. A. Hoffmann								TRANSYLVANIAN REVIEW				23	3			40	51					FAL 2014	2014	The element that brings together two apparently different writers such as Ion Agarbiceanu (1882-1963) and E. T. A. Hoffmann (1776-1822) is their inclination towards the fantastic, the subtle mix of the real with the imaginary, as well as their belief in the existence of ghosts, of spirits of the underworld, a belief quite widely spread among numerous peoples. Legends about mining have been a generous source of inspiration for the authors of fantastic literature, the readers being fascinated with the miraculous stories linked to the fabulous fortunes hidden in the underground. As the mirage of money is universal, it is not by accident that a celebrated writer such as E. T A. Hoffmann describes in the "Mines of Falun" a series of happenings that under numerous aspects are extremely similar to the stories told by Ion Agarbiceanu in the novel Arhanghelii (The archangels) or in his stories inspired by the mythology of the Western Carpathians: "Valva-Bailor" (The fairy of the mines), "Valea-Dracului" (Devil's cove) and "Duhul bailor" (The ghost of the mines).									0	0	0	0	0	1221-1249		WOS:000347141600004

It is all part of his art of docere et delectare. His novels and his essays are all about knowing more about our history, our society, our culture, and our world, including those of imaginary lands. The numerous colorful illustrations that accompany The Book of Legendary Lands make this recent publication the fourth encyclopedic illustrated text after The History of Beauty, The History of Ugliness, and The Vertigo of Lists and another testimonial of Eco's love for interdisciplinary research. Eco has also had a long history of loving to examine fakes and forgeries a familiar topic recurring often in both his scientific and creative writings. It is his love for analyzing "The Force of Falsity" in our history (the false not necessarily in the form of lies but also in the form of error) that has motivated Eco to publish his research on how curiosity, imagination, errors, and serendipity are at the foundation of many of the discoveries throughout the centuries. Imaginary and fake maps, monsters, islands, civilizations, documents, languages, secrets, and perfect worlds all come under scrutiny as Eco with his familiar wit and irony narrates and documents the history of legendary lands from Plato to our times.									0	0	0	0	0	0042-0247		WOS:000346896400005

As both physical and semiotic specimens in correspondence networks, crocodilians become a medium of exchange through which Bartram and De Quincey confront the limits of personal identity and imperial expansion. By bringing together these two writers, the essay shows how crocodilians, as a medium of exchange, shift from physical, material specimens to abstract, imaginary symbols, and how natural history's correspondence networks facilitate an abstraction and effacement of animals.									0	0	0	0	0	1063-1801		WOS:000347671700003

While their aims were more limited than those of arbistristas across the Atlantic, colonial advocates' idealized visions of the island and claims about the major threats it faced represented a shared local imaginary, and their proposals found a receptive audience in metropolitan authorities, who agreed that Hispaniola had strategic value but were constrained by limited resources. Taken together, the recommendations of overseas advocates and the responses of royal councilors illustrate a transatlantic conception of the Spanish monarchy and an active desire for restoration during the reign of Charles II, despite the supposed decadence of Spain under the last Habsburg monarch.									0	0	0	0	0	1060-9164		WOS:000345837000005

During 2009-10, however, the University of Brighton research network Methodological Innovations: Using Mass Observation (MIMO) brought together 150 international academics, archivists, writers and artists to debate and share methods for analysing the materials of the post-1981 Mass Observation Project (MOP) in particular. Through discussion lists and events, a range of disciplinary approaches were brought to bear on core topics of methodological concern, from the 'representativeness' of the writing panel and discussions about sampling and extrapolation, through to debates on the very nature of Mass Observation (MO) material and how it might be defined. This paper draws on these productive discussions and brings them together with previously unanalysed insights and reflections on similar issues by MOP correspondents, for as Sheridan, Street and Bloome (2000) have argued, 'Mass-Observers themselves are as reflective and thoughtful about issues raised, methodological and theoretical as well as ethical and political, as the academic commentators.' Using responses to the MOP directive, 'Being Part of Research' in parallel with MIMO discussions, this paper draws new connections between contributors and users, as two of the core constituent bodies involved in the production of meaning in MO. Through comparative analysis of each groups' discussion of methodology, this paper highlights the often unarticulated but ultimately interdependent relationship between contributors and their readers in order to reveal their shared understandings, mirrored concerns and mutual imaginaries.									0	0	0	0	0	1360-7804		WOS:000344993400012		
J	Wilson-Kovacs, Dana								'Clearly Necessary', 'Wonderful' and 'Engrossing'? Mass Observation Correspondents Discuss Forensic Technologies								SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH ONLINE				19	3					11	10.5153/sro.3375			SEP 11 2014	2014	This article explores the perspectives of Mass Observation (MO) correspondents on crime investigation and application of forensic technologies in police work. Using the Panel's replies to two distinct, independently commissioned Directives (the 2006 Spring Directive, Part 1 'Genes, Genetics and Cloning' and the 2011 Autumn/Winter Directive, Part 1, 'Crime and Investigation'), the article examines the meanings and place correspondents give to genetics and forensic science in everyday life and in relation to crime and investigation, surveillance and law and order. The analysis surveys MO correspondents' understandings of the relationship between forensic technologies and policing and identifies the ways in which correspondents interpret, engage with and discuss their writing tasks. It is argued that MO data offer significant insights into how individuals select and appropriate information on different topics and incorporate this knowledge into distinct worldviews. These accounts constitute a rich, yet under-explored resource for (1) documenting the range of resources that inform the 'forensic imaginary' on which correspondents draw in explaining their fascination with or disinterest in criminal investigation and (2) conceptualising the ways in which distinct publics reflect on representations of crime. While the analysis highlights the benefits and limitations of a Mass Observation approach to documenting collective views on the role of forensic technologies in crime investigation, the conclusion reflects more broadly on both the contribution such an approach could make to the literature on public understandings of science and the uses and potential of MO data for social science researchers.									0	0	0	0	0	1360-7804		WOS:000344993400014

Drawing upon original ethnographic material gathered from fieldwork in 2012/2013, we reframe the analysis of such cities through recognition of novel forms of urban imaginaries, emergent narratively, that may take the shape of dichotomies or trichotomies reconfiguring hegemonic notions such as formal-informal, centre-periphery or urban-suburban. In conclusion, it is suggested that this citywide ongoing process highlights the importance of appreciating dynamic discursive engagements with urban space, which not only are at odds with hegemonic definitions of the city but also, crucially, impinge on people's own urban strategies - in Maputo as well as elsewhere.									0	0	0	0	0	0042-0980		WOS:000341824400003		
J	Ben-Yehoyada, Naor								Transnational Political Cosmology: A Central Mediterranean Example								COMPARATIVE STUDIES IN SOCIETY AND HISTORY				56	4			870	901		10.1017/S0010417514000437			OCT 2014	2014	This paper examines the workings of kinship and marriage idioms in transnational political imaginary in the central Mediterranean to challenge current academic reliance on the notion of fraternity as the symbolic building block of both national and global political relations. Since the 1960s, the Sicilian town of Mazara del Vallo and its fishing fleet have become entwined in intensifying interactions with Tunisia and the wider Maghreb. These interactions-specifically the Tunisian-Italian "Fish War" and construction of a trans-Mediterranean natural gas pipeline between North Africa and Europe-rejuvenated the old geopolitical imagination of the Mediterranean and helped produce the central Mediterranean as a spatio-temporal field of political action. Italians and Tunisians perceived each other as related, and staged the trans-Mediterranean infrastructural project as a sort of European-African (cross-cousin) marriage. I begin by examining the tensions between two central kinship idioms-fraternity and cousinage-in current understandings of transnational relations. I then discuss the growing prevalence of a transnational political cosmology of affinity across difference over that of shared descent and sameness that characterize national alignments. I conclude by examining how Tunisians and Sicilians in Mazara today cast each other in roles deriving from segmentary schemes they share, but on the content of which they disagree. By applying concepts associated with kinship and marriage studies to recent Mediterranean history, I show how segmentation, a concept anthropologists abandoned when they crossed the Mediterranean on their way into Europe, can help us understand transnational politics.									0	0	0	0	0	0010-4175		WOS:000342997600004		
J	Amirteimoori, Alireza; Kordrostami, Sohrab; Khoshandam, Leila								Multi-dimensional non-discretionary factors in production processes: a data envelopment analysis								IMA JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT MATHEMATICS				25	4			435	448		10.1093/imaman/dpt021			OCT 2014	2014	Data envelopment analysis (DEA) uses data on multiple inputs and outputs of a set of decision making units to measure their efficiency. However, the classic DEA model does not take non-discretionary factors into consideration. These factors are not controllable, play an important role in production processes, and ignoring them leads to poor estimation of efficiency. This paper proposes a two-stage procedure to handle non-discretionary inputs. To this end, first, a new imaginary environment is created from the existing environments and next, in this new dummy environment, the multiplier form of the DEA model is used. We perform a simulated comparison to show the advantages of the proposed approach. Finally, a real case study of bank branches with two non-discretionary variables is used to demonstrate the applicability of our approach.									0	0	0	0	0	1471-678X		WOS:000343319300004		
J	Schwartz, Bennett L.; Pillot, Mathieu; Bacon, Elisabeth								Contextual information influences the feeling of knowing in episodic memory								CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION				29				96	104		10.1016/j.concog.2014.08.018			OCT 2014	2014	The feeling of knowing (FOK) predicts the likelihood of eventually recognizing currently unrecalled items. Koriat (1993, 1995) showed that retrieval of partial target information influences FOK ratings. Building on Koriat's view, the noncriterial-recollection hypothesis contends that contextual information influences FOKs (Brewer, Marsh, Clark-Foos, & Meeks, 2010). Our study assessed the validity of the noncriterial-recollection hypothesis by controlling the amount of potentially-retrievable contextual information presented to participants. We varied the amount of contextual information accompanying the name and image of imaginary animals. There were three information conditions: minimum (name and image), medium (name, image, and country), and maximum (name, image, country, diet and weight). Information condition did not affect recall accuracy. The minimum condition resulted in greater response output (recall and commission errors together). FOKs for unrecalled items were lower in the minimum condition than the other conditions. Consistent with the noncriterial-recollection hypothesis, FOKs were positively correlated with the retrieval of contextual information. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

J	Levine, Ari Daniel								Stages of Decline: Cultural Memory, Urban Nostalgia and Political Indignation as Imaginaries of Resistance in Yue Ke's Pillar Histories (Ting shi)								MEDIEVAL HISTORY JOURNAL				17	2	SI		337	378		10.1177/0971945814545007			OCT 2014	2014	After the fall of the Northern Song (sic) (960-1127) capital of Kaifeng (sic) to Jurchen invaders in 1127, diasporic literati of the Southern Song dynasty (sic) (1127-1279) recreated and revisited its lost sites through textual commemoration, especially in memorabilia literature (biji (sic), lit. brush notes'). As knowledge of the city passed from communicative memory into cultural memory, its decline and destruction became the focus of nostalgia and indignation for Yue Ke (sic) (1183-1234), the author of the Pillar Histories (Ting shi (sic)), a collection of counter-narratives of Northern Song history that expressed the shared experience of social trauma induced by dynastic collapse. Disconnected from their spatial context and even from historical fact, the city's memory sites became stages for amoralistic declension narrative, in which the city's destruction and occupation was assumed to have been instigated by the decadence of the imperial court of the passive Emperor Huizong (sic) (r. 1100-26) and his nefarious ministers'. The most colourful elements of Yue's ludic and fantastical narratives became the focus of his indignation, which encouraged his readers to denounce the traitors who had betrayed the empire by inviting the Jurchen invasion. In the Pillar Histories, Yue deployed textual imaginaries of nostalgia as forms of resistance by re-contesting the past events that led to dynastic collapse. By reconstructing the city in the cultural memory of his fellow diasporic literati, Yue was creating a vision of an ideal political, cultural and moral community that once existed at the dynasty's inception, and might be reconstituted in the future, if and when Song subjects recaptured their lost homeland.									0	0	0	0	0	0971-9458		WOS:000343769100006

The empirical material comes from an ethnography conducted between 2010 and 2011 in neighborhoods in the suburbs of Barcelona. The main techniques used were document analysis, participant observation with various youth immigrant groups and collection of data from oral sources with diferents types of informants. The results of the study discuss the social image of these groups, which stigmatize young people that are involved in them and it is symptom of segregated reception of immigration, increasingly in times of economic crisis. We analyze the dynamics of violence concerning these groups; at the same time, we interprete these groups as circulation spaces of social capital and as forms of agency, that can empower the members individually and collectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0210-5233		WOS:000343877000004		
J	Esser, Daniel E.								Security scales: spectacular and endemic violence in post-invasion Kabul, Afghanistan								ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION				26	2			373	388		10.1177/0956247814544098			OCT 2014	2014	This article juxtaposes two distinct violent dynamics in a highly securitized urban space: one covered by global media in every detail, yet of marginal importance to the vast majority of city dwellers; the other endemic, but absent from outsiders' urban imaginary of life and death in Kabul. Although insurgent forces have utilized Afghanistan's capital city as a stage for acts of spectacular violence ever since the 2001 international invasion, for most city dwellers, especially women and children, domestic abuse has constituted the main threat to physical well-being. In contrast, increases in mortality and morbidity due to insurgent attacks carried out in the city between 2002 and 2011 have been infinitesimal. An interpretive framework that draws from critical geographical scholarship by highlighting global discourses and local norms helps expose that the international community's discursive construction of Kabul as the locus for post-2001 neoliberal state-building lies at the heart of persistent, yet largely invisible, victimization within the city. The analysis demonstrates how such scalar politics of security have turned Kabul into an urban stage that provides global visibility of spectacular violence against foreigners while eclipsing endemic causes of bodily harm among Afghans.									0	0	0	0	0	0956-2478		WOS:000343990500004		
J	Carpentier, Nico								A CALL TO ARMS AN ESSAY ON THE ROLE OF THE INTELLECTUAL AND THE NEED TO PRODUCE NEW IMAGINARIES								JAVNOST-THE PUBLIC				21	3			77	91					OCT 2014	2014	The essay takes a historical reflection on the identity of the intellectual as a starting point, highlighting four key debates that have tried to provide meaning to this identity. These debates concern the intellectual's class position, the intellectual's connection to other classes and social groups, the location of the intellectual and the relationship with the university, and the publicness of the intellectual. These debates then feed into a more engaged reflection on the desirability of intellectuals to intervene in a society characterised by three types of crisis the crisis of representative democracy, the economic crisis and the crisis of mimesis - investigating how their rethorics can be transformed into counter-hegemonic discourses. Although it is argued that the production of new ideological projects is not straightforward because of the complex relationship between agency and discursive structures, the evenly difficult relationship between complexity and simplicity, and the ontological issues triggered by the crisis of mimesis the essay pleads for the establishment of networks of intellectuals, driven by principles of value centrality, modular collaboration and non-essentialism, that allow them to critically rethink our core social structures, in order to establish new horizons to imagine social change.									0	0	0	0	0	1318-3222		WOS:000344043500005

The five disputants include an imaginary neuroscientist from California, an Oxford don from the 1950s, a lady, Peter Strawson and Alan White. They examine the peculiar idioms of having: having a body, having a mind, having a soul and having a self. To have a mind, it is concluded, is not to own anything, but to be able to do a variety of things: to reason from premises to conclusions; to act, think, and feel things for reasons. To have a body is to possess a variety of somatic characteristics. Hence a distinction is drawn between the body one is, and the body one has. Accordingly, the problem of the relation between my mind and my body simply disintegrates, since there can be no relation between my intellectual abilities and my somatic features.									0	0	0	0	0	0031-8191		WOS:000344479700002		
J	Kye, Seung B.								The Altar of Great Gratitude: A Korean Memory of Ming China under Manchu Dominance, 1704-1894								JOURNAL OF KOREAN RELIGIONS				5	2			71	88					OCT 2014	2014	With emphasis on the Korean performance at a special altar designed to pay tribute to the memory of Ming emperors, this paper looks at the way in which Korean elites under Manchu dominance recalled Ming China and actually summoned the ghosts of Ming emperors unto their political stage. From the early sixteenth century, Ming China had been honored in Choson as the suzerain-father, with the result that the Ming became the object for Choson filial piety as well as loyalty. Choson's submission to the Manchus in 1637, however, forced an ideological crisis upon the Choson leadership since the country's compromise with the Manchus meant that the Choson king and court officials had violated two primary Confucian values, those of loyalty and filial piety, on which the ruling mechanism of the dynasty had been based. The establishment of the Altar of Great Gratitude (Taebodan) within a Choson royal palace in 1704 was designed to offset the violation and visibly demonstrate Choson's righteous obligations to the fallen Ming regardless of the real geopolitical circumstances. Thereafter, Choson kings regularly performed sacrifices for three Ming emperors on the anniversaries of those emperors' deaths. These rituals continued until Seoul was occupied by the Japanese in 1894 on the eve of the Sino-Japanese War, implying that mainstream Choson elites under Manchu dominance still sought to live spiritually under an imaginary Ming order.									0	0	0	0	0	2093-7288		WOS:000345055800004

I try to remap the areas of transparency and opacity in language in more translator-friendly ways.

I start by rehearsing those essentials. I then illustrate the two theses and their counter-intuitive ramifications by dint of three life stories of imaginary persons. Subsequently, I offer a reconstruction of Aristotle's theses which, while going beyond the textual evidence, remains faithful to core elements of his moral and educational theory. I finally bring some considerations from the current literature on self-change to bear on this Aristotelian reconstruction, arguing that the effects of bad upbringing can be undone through contemplative activity. I also elicit some implications of the proposed argument for contemporary moral education and schooling.									0	0	0	0	0	0305-7240		WOS:000343651900005

Although demonstrating the strength of Foucault's contribution to debates about security and circulation, sustained attention has yet to be afforded to a central notion in Foucault's work on security; the concept of milieu. Engaging in particular with Foucault's 1977-1978 lectures at the College de France collectively known in English as Security, Territory, Population (2007), this article introduces and critically appraises Foucault's notion of milieu. I will show how the notion of milieu renders population an object of governance for security at the level of circulation. I draw upon Foucault's commentary on the concept of milieu to explore empirical material generated by my own research into risk analysis technologies used by the British Fire and Rescue Service (FRS) to govern fire. Although my research demonstrates the crucial importance of Foucault's milieu in examining how security is enacted on circulation, I also outline shortcomings in Foucault's work. The case of risk analysis technologies in the FRS suggests that the conceptualisation of circulation which Foucault offers is overly crude. More nuanced understandings of circulation in relation to other modalities of movement are necessarily harnessed by the FRS in order to secure population through circulation. The differentiations made by risk analysis technologies between forms of movement, furthermore, are enrolled within and facilitate specific temporal imaginaries through which the FRS both makes sense of fire as a risk and intervenes before fires occur.									0	0	0	0	0	1745-0101		WOS:000343415800003		
J	Connell, John; Iveson, Kurt								An Eruv for St Ives? Religion, identity, place and conflict on the Sydney north shore								AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER				45	4			429	446		10.1080/00049182.2014.953731			OCT 2 2014	2014	Religious identity, when marked by physical changes to urban landscapes, has been a cause of tension and conflict in many cities. In the Sydney suburb of St Ives, an attempt to create an eruv, a symbolic and only partly physical boundary around orthodox Jewish space, was vigorously opposed and eventually defeated through the planning system. The religious and physical significance of the eruv resulted in diverse rationales of opposition, centred on the physical and environmental impact, the conceptual nature of boundaries and the role of religion and 'modernity' in everyday suburban life. The place of an eruv was opposed with reference to spatial imaginaries of the nation, the suburb and the secular public, as religion and worship intersected with the politics of urban citizenship and belonging. Each of these spatial imaginaries was constructed by opponents in such a way as to deny a place for an eruv in St Ives, and reinforced through the application of planning instruments which eventually refused permission for an eruv. To many residents, public space was seen to be at risk, raising complex questions over amenity, the politics and perception of difference and what is in or out of place. The planning framework adjudicating such development proposals must transcend such imaginaries in the production of public spaces in multicultural cities.									0	0	0	0	0	0004-9182		WOS:000343666600002

Exposing how American Africanism works through rap culture offers a broader vantage to examine the context in which Black artists participate in modern minstrelsy by emphasizing causal factors beyond individual cultural producers and towards systemic representations of the national imaginary.									0	0	0	0	0	1099-9949		WOS:000346190600011

Ideally, the black fantastic is the source of "minor-key sensibilities" that provide a basis for a substantive post-colonial imaginary and politics. Post-blackness, on the other hand, has been used to describe both artistic and popular identity movements that aim to lift the "burden of representation" from black artists or black people generally. I argue that although those who fashion post-blackness as a popular identity movement divest it of much of its subversive force, at least one type of artistic post-blackness enables the black fantastic.									0	0	0	0	0	1099-9949		WOS:000346190600012

Phase-based treatment including (a) stabilization, (b) trauma-focused therapy, and (c) integration of personality with recovery of connection appears to be the treatment of choice. Objective: The objective of this article is to describe and evaluate the therapeutic process of a single case from a holistic perspective. Method: We present a case report of a 47-year-old woman treated for severe complex PTSD resulting from repeated sexual and physical abuse in early childhood and moderate psychotic symptoms stemming from Dandy Walker Syndrome with hydrocephalus. Results: The patient was treated with quetiapine (600-1,000 mg) and citalopram (40 mg). Stabilization consisted of intensive psychiatric nursing care in the home and stabilizing group treatment for complex PTSD. After stabilization, the following symptom domains showed improvement: self-regulation, self-esteem, assertiveness, avoidance of social activities, and negative cognitions. However, intrusions and arousal persisted and were therefore subsequently treated with prolonged imaginary exposure that also included narrative writing assignments and a final closing ritual. This intensive multidisciplinary, phase-based approach proved effective: All symptoms of complex PTSD were in full remission. Social integration and recovery were promoted with the reduction of polypharmacy and the provision of social skills training and lifestyle training. Conclusion: The present case shows a phase-based treatment approach with multidisciplinary collaborative care to be effective for the treatment of a case of complex PTSD with comorbid psychotic disorder stemming from severe neurological impairment. Replication of this promising approach is therefore called for.									0	0	0	0	0	1529-9732		WOS:000342519900006	24983777

We expected that having/not having ICs would distinguish children's coping strategies and competence less than type of companion (i.e., personified object or invisible friend) or quality of child-IC relationship (i.e., egalitarian or hierarchical). We interviewed 72 three- to six-year-olds and their mothers about children's coping strategies and competence; teachers rated competence. Mothers reported ICs. IC presence and type did not differentiate coping strategies, but children with egalitarian relationships chose more constructive/prosocial coping strategies, and teachers rated them more socially competent than children with hierarchical child-IC relationships. Mothers related ICs to cognitive competence. Findings highlight (1) modest relations between imaginary relationships and coping/competence; (2) distinctions between mothers' perceptions and IC functions; and (3) that ICs parallel real relationships in that different dimensions (presence, type/identity, and relationship quality) might be unique contributors to children's socioemotional development.									0	0	0	0	0	0961-205X		WOS:000342764000011		
J	Winter, Yves								Debating violence on the desert island: Engels, Duhring and Robinson Crusoe								CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY				13	4			318	338		10.1057/cpt.2013.28			NOV 2014	2014	Ever since the publication in 1719 of Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, the novel's eponymous protagonist has had a pervasive presence in the modern social and cultural imaginary, giving rise to an entire literary genre known as Robinsonades. In Anti-Duhring (1877), Friedrich Engels identifies such a Robinsonade in the work of Eugen von Duhring, the target of his polemic, and draws on it for a critique of ahistorical theories of violence. The particular version of the Robinsonade Engels ascribes to Duhring is fabricated, yet a close examination of this fabrication suggests that it serves important analytic and interpretive purposes. Ironically, Engels's critique of Robinsonades is so compelling that it ends up undermining his own tendency to economic and technological reductionism. Despite Engels's attempts to distance himself from the Robinsonade he projects onto Duhring, the Crusoe story acts as a fraught supplement to his own theory of violence. In particular, it reveals the tensions in his work between, on the one hand, economic and technological reductionism, and on the other hand, attention to social, cultural and symbolic forces without which no plausible history of violence can be written.									0	0	0	0	0	1470-8914		WOS:000343270200001		
J	Ferguson, Kathy E.								Is it an anarchist act to call oneself an anarchist? Judith Butler, John Turner and insurrectionary speech								CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THEORY				13	4			339	357		10.1057/cpt.2013.45			NOV 2014	2014	Anarchists and homosexuals have periodically occupied similar positions in relation to US laws and policies: both have functioned as the needed outside against which the proper inside of political order can be established and maintained. Both have blurred the relation of words to deeds, speaking words that are forbidden because the words themselves are seen as dangerous deeds. Examining the deportation case of anarchist John Turner in 1903 and the 1993 Pentagon ban on homosexuals serving openly in the military, and utilizing the intellectual tools provided by Judith Butler in her analysis of speech acts, this article investigates the process of criminalizing an identity category as well as the political context from which that criminalization can be challenged. My goals are to make use of Butler's arguments about insurrectionary speech to understand anarchism's historical role in the American political imaginary, and to supplement Butler's analysis with greater attention to the histories of anarchist struggle.									0	0	0	0	0	1470-8914		WOS:000343270200002

This exploration will also reveal how anti-feminism relates to anti-scepticism in the masculinist and philosophist imaginaries. Using Pascal as an initial point of contact, the article then suggests how feminist philosophy and Pyrrhonism might develop a rational solidarity in the practice of philosophizing and in undoing, and keeping undone, oppressive relationships.									0	0	0	0	0	0264-8334		WOS:000343783000003

This article uses a praxeological perspective to work out the enactment practices in this imaginary, viewing them as various nexuses of doings and sayings. In doing so, it stresses the relevance of the production and influence of different reports in this process and seeks to offer an insight into the complexity of the setting in which this imaginary was enacted.									0	0	0	0	0	0309-1317		WOS:000344400900011		
J	Varro, Krisztina								Spatial Imaginaries of the Dutch-German-Belgian Borderlands: A Multidimensional Analysis of Cross-Border Regional Governance								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH				38	6			2235	2255		10.1111/1468-2427.12202			NOV 2014	2014	Parallel to the proliferation of cross-border regional cooperation initiatives in the European Union, increasing scholarly attention has been given to conceptualizing cross-border governance in recent decades. In line with the recognition that cross-border regions have not undermined the significance of nation-state spaces but have added to their complexity, conceptual frameworks of analysis have become more and more refined. However, studies still tend to be framed in one spatial grammar, that of territory, scale or network, and fail to consider the ways in which these different dimensions become interlocked. The aim of this article is to address this lack by developing a multidimensional perspective, in order to finally circumvent state-centric thinking on cross-border regions and to offer a more nuanced account of whether and how new imaginaries of spatial governance institutionalize. These arguments are demonstrated by means of a case study of cross-border regional governance in the Dutch-German-Belgian borderlands.									0	0	0	0	0	0309-1317		WOS:000344400900017		
J	Swaminathan, Ramanathan								The epistemology of a sea view: mindscapes of space, power and value in Mumbai								ISLAND STUDIES JOURNAL				9	2			277	292					NOV 2014	2014	Mumbai is a collection of seven islands strung together by a historically layered process of reclamation, migration and resettlement. The built landscape reflects the unique geographical characteristics of Mumbai's archipelagic nature. This paper first explores the material, non-material and epistemological contours of space in Mumbai. It establishes that the physical contouring of space through institutional, administrative and non-institutional mechanisms are architected by complex notions of distance from the city's coasts. Second, the paper unravels the unique discursive strands of space, spatiality and territoriality of Mumbai. It builds the case that the city's collective imaginary of value is foundationally linked to the archipelagic nature of the city. Third, the paper deconstructs the complex power dynamics how a sea view turns into a gaze: one that is at once a point of view as it is a factor that provides physical and mental form to space. In conclusion, the paper makes the case that the mindscapes of space, value and power in Mumbai have archipelagic material foundations.									1	0	0	0	1	1715-2593		WOS:000343954800007

In this sense, the "new" specialist publishing becomes a tool to reinforce Made in Italy, by transferring contents that can enable its deep understanding, and, consequentially, to promote a more conscious consumption.The article presents some examples of the most interesting and well-known cases of this kind of publishing, highlighting their high qualitative standards as editorial outputs, not only in term of textual contents and layout but also in term of editorial approach and visual contents. So the article not only draws a deepening path about Made in Italy contemporary issues but also offers a comment on the current perspective of the fashion, or more generally design-driven, publishing sector.									0	0	0	0	0	1756-9370		WOS:000344712300009

J	Houston, Donna; Ruming, Kristian								Suburban Toxicity: A Political Ecology of Asbestos in Australian Cities								GEOGRAPHICAL RESEARCH				52	4	SI		400	410		10.1111/1745-5871.12075			NOV 2014	2014	This paper explores the toxic legacy of asbestos in Australian suburbs and cities. During the post-war period, Australia had one of the highest per capita rates of asbestos use in the developed world. As a consequence of this indiscriminate use, Australia also has one of the highest rates of asbestos dust disease in the world. Drawing on feminist approaches to urban political ecology (UPE) and the materialities of waste, we trace the entanglement of asbestos within the everyday spaces of homes and suburbs and through urban governance structures and processes of urban regeneration. We argue that UPE provides an important framework for putting asbestos stories and practices in the city together. UPE highlights the relational entanglements and injustices of asbestos, which render it as matter that circulates through bodies, homes, infrastructures, working-class histories and suburban imaginaries. This approach challenges the construction of asbestos in terms of its hazardous obsolescence and resituates it as complex matter that continues to be lived with and practiced.									0	0	0	0	0	1745-5863		WOS:000344522100007		
J	Mollett, Sharlene								A Modern Paradise Garifuna Land, Labor, and Displacement-in-Place								LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES				41	6			27	45		10.1177/0094582X13518756			NOV 2014	2014	On the Honduran North Coast, the Afro-indigenous Garifuna struggle to maintain access to and control of their ancestral lands. Their concerns are due in part to the Honduran state's long-standing goal of modernizing the North Coast and providing an attractive site for foreign investment in land and tourism. The state's commitment to improving the country's development profile by opening coastal land ownership to foreigners often overlooks international and constitutional recognition of communal forms of land tenure. Ethnographic participant observation in the Garifuna community of Tornabe, a fishing and farming village in the Tela Bay region, supplemented by semistructured interviews, historical data collection, discourse analysis, and research on agrarian and environmental policy, suggests that Garifuna displacement is a product of the state's development imaginaries, which racialize the Garifuna as backward and consider their blackness redeemable only by their labor. En la costa norte de Honduras, los garifunas afro-indigenas luchan por mantener el acceso a y control de sus tierras ancestrales. Sus preocupaciones se deben en parte a la meta de largo plazo del estado hondureno por modernizar la costa norte y hacerla atractiva a la inversion extranjera en tierras y turismo. El compromiso del estado por mejorar el perfil de desarrollo del pais accediendo a que exista propiedad extranjera en la region costena a menudo ignora el reconocimiento constitucional e internacional de formas comunales de tenencia de la tierra. Observacion etnografica participante en la comunidad garifuna de Tornabe, una aldea de pescadores y agricultores en la region de Bahia de Tela, complementada con entrevistas semi-estructuradas, recopilacion de datos historicos, analisis del discurso e investigacion sobre politica agraria y ambiental, sugiere que el desplazamiento forzado garifuna es un producto de imaginarios de desarrollo estatales que los racializan como retrogradas y consideran que su negrura solo es redimible a traves de su trabajo.									0	0	0	0	0	0094-582X		WOS:000344685400003

Accordingly, sustainability leads to obvious struggles between different systems of representations worldwide, and temporal orderliness is at the core of these battles. In this article, I focus on the future. Domesticating the future by sustainability is a central element, in particular, of the cultural confrontation between the West and the Rest'. Moreover, the ideology of sustainability proves to be self-contradictory: on one side promotes cultural diversity, but on the other side operates only under a singular and homogeneous construct of the future.									0	0	0	0	0	0961-463X		WOS:000344658400006

Areas of the WTC with a coherence higher than the calculated optimal threshold were obtained, and the sum of their areas was used as a criterion to differentiate between groups of experienced insight-focused meditators, calm-focused meditators and a control group. This method demonstrated the highest accuracy for the real WTC parts in the frontal region, while for the imaginary parts, the highest accuracy was shown for the frontal occipital pairs of electrodes. In the frontal area, in the broadband frequency, both types of experienced meditators demonstrated an enlargement of the increased coherence areas for the real WTC parts. For the imaginary parts unaffected by the volume conduction and global artefacts, the most significant increase occurred for the frontal occipital pair of electrodes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

J	Grabowski, D.; Rasmussen, K. K.								Adolescents' health identities: A qualitative and theoretical study of health education courses								SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE				120				67	75		10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.09.011			NOV 2014	2014	In this paper we highlight the role of health identity in health education for adolescents. In school-based approaches to health education, it is often difficult to present health information and health communication in ways that make sense and appeal to adolescents. The concept of health identity has the potential of providing an analytical framework as well as practical recommendations for these issues and problem areas. The paper reports on an empirical study of elements of health identity in the context of health courses for adolescents using interview data, observation studies and a theoretical construction focussing on self-observation, horizons of significance, expectational structures and social imaginaries. We present our findings in four main themes: 1) Adolescents' health identities are observed and developed when things matter, 2) Adolescents' health identities are observed and developed in relational contexts, 3) Adolescents' health identities are developed on the basis of observations of past, present and future health and 4) Adolescents' health identities are clearly defined. The paper provides health practitioners with important knowledge about why and how health-educational approaches should focus on health identity in order to provide conditions that create a significant health educating effect for all adolescents not just for those who are already healthy.

J	Kuchler, Magdalena								Sweet dreams (are made of cellulose): Sociotechnical imaginaries of second-generation bioenergy in the global debate								ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS				107				431	437		10.1016/j.ecolecon.2014.09.014			NOV 2014	2014	This paper critically examines the sociotechnical imaginaries of second-generation bioenergy technology in the global debate, exemplified by the deliberations of international organizations specializing in food and agriculture, energy security, and climate change. The analysis is guided by two objectives: first, to identify and illuminate visions of future advanced biofiiels by implementing the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries; second, to scrutinize these imaginaries using a critical and diagnostic utopian method to determine whether the projected visions entail the promise of radical change and hope for socioeconomic transition to a "green" future, or instead manifest an ideological stranglehold striving to perpetuate the status quo. The article demonstrates that sociotechnical imaginaries of advanced biofuel technology superficially project the illusion of utopian potential. On closer examination, however, visions of future second-generation biofuels are limited by the necessity of cost-effectiveness that underpins market competitiveness. They manifest utopian impotence to imagine the future beyond the ideological closure of the currently dominant socioeconomic system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Children who had an IC were more likely than their peers without an IC to describe their best friends with reference to their mental characteristics, but IC status was unrelated to children's theory of mind performance and reported prosocial behaviour and behavioural difficulties. These findings are discussed in the context of the proposal that there is a competence-performance gap in children's mentalizing abilities. (c) 2014 The Authors.

Regardless of the type of tourism, favoring the selling of goods and rendering of services occurs, which includes activities to provide sexual services. The tourist is viewed in the imaginary of the sex workers as the "ideal" customer, conveying the idea of being willing to spend money in his non-daily-routine quest, and paying higher prices. In the setting of the city of Recife, the Boa Viagem District and specially the Conselheiro Aguiar Avenue, spatial slices with strong touristic infrastructure and equipment investments, have attracted over time not only hotels, tourism agencies, restaurants and others, as well as favored female street prostitution.									0	0	0	0	0	1138-9788		WOS:000345801500007		
J	Navas Ferrer, Teresa								The symbolic construction of a capital.

Such productions, in the form of urban cartography and views, are even more valuable when they are the result of correlation between peak periods in urban planning, real urban development and the creation of an account of appropriation of the city. Iconographic representation possesses a more effective communicative capacity than that derived from urban planning, hence it produces a symbolic construction of an urban reality with a powerful persistence in the cultural imaginary. The case of the city of Barcelona and its tourist cartography of the early 20th century is an intense and interesting example of this relationship.									0	0	0	0	0	1138-9788		WOS:000345801500013		
J	Meloni, Maurizio; Testa, Giuseppe								Scrutinizing the epigenetics revolution								BIOSOCIETIES				9	4			431	456		10.1057/biosoc.2014.22			NOV 2014	2014	Epigenetics is one of the most rapidly expanding fields in the life sciences. Its rise is frequently framed as a revolutionary turn that heralds a new epoch both for gene-based epistemology and for the wider discourse on life that pervades knowledge-intensive societies of the molecular age. The fundamentals of this revolution remain however to be scrutinized, and indeed the very contours of what counts as 'epigenetic' are often blurred. This is reflected also in the mounting discourse on the societal implications of epigenetics, in which vast expectations coexist with significant uncertainty about what aspects of this science are most relevant for politics or policy alike. This is therefore a suitable time to reflect on the directions that social theory could most productively take in the scrutiny of this revolution. Here we take this opportunity in both its scholarly and normative dimension, that is, proposing a roadmap for social theorizing on epigenetics that does not shy away from, and indeed hopefully guides, the framing of its most socially relevant outputs. To this end, we start with an epistemological reappraisal of epigenetic discourse that valorizes the blurring of meanings as a critical asset for the field and privileged analytical entry point. We then propose three paths of investigation. The first looks at the structuring elements of controversies and visions around epigenetics. The second probes the mutual constitution between the epigenetic reordering of living phenomena and the normative settlements that orient individual and collective responsibilities. The third highlights the material import of epigenetics and the molecularization of culture that it mediates. We suggest that these complementary strands provide both an epistemically and socially self-reflective framework to advance the study of epigenetics as a molecular juncture between nature and nurture and thus as the new critical frontier in the social studies of the life sciences.									0	0	0	0	0	1745-8552		WOS:000346130800005		
J	Purpura, Marco								Racial Masquerade Italian Style? Whiteface and Blackface in Zeudi Araya's 1970s Comedies								ITALIAN STUDIES				69	3			394	414		10.1179/0075163414Z.00000000079			NOV 2014	2014	This article analyzes the performances of Eritrean actress Zeudi Araya in her middlebrow comedies from the late 1970s. I interpret her popularity in parallel with the incipient and coterminous immigration of women to Italy, from the former colonies of the Horn of Africa as well as from other developing countries, who provided informal welfare for the modernizing Italian family and partially substituted for Italian women's double presence inside and outside the home. Il signor Robinson (Corbucci 1976) and Tesoromio (Paradisi 1979), in which Araya plays a domestic worker, include performances of whiteface, blackface, and mistaken identities between Italian and foreign characters. This racial masquerade inscribes the black immigrant woman within adulterous romances in which Araya's exotic and submissive characters substitute for the emancipated white woman in the Italian family.The substitution simultaneously works to recall the colonial figure of the docile Black Venus while also restoring the sexual potency of the male inetto, a stock character from the Italian comic tradition. Further, these romances are framed within a geographical dichotomy of inclusion in private spaces and exclusion from public spaces. Araya's characters either are entrapped within the intimate space of the Italian home or, when they appear in public, are located outside Italian national borders, in an escapist elsewhere such as the Caribbean or the imaginary island of Balic. As this elsewhere is detached from any immediate references to the history of Italian colonialism, Araya's comedies can draw from the colonial repertoire of images and visual tropes while disavowing any ideological engagement with that legacy.									0	0	0	0	0	0075-1634		WOS:000346148500006

However, even in films not set in, or in any way involving, Nazi Berlin but rather only filmed on location in the city, material memories of the city's fascist spaces can be shown to exert their influence. In comparing the eerily similar geo-aesthetic styles of two relatively obscure, relatively recent science fiction action filmsKurt Wimmer's Equilibrium (2002) and Karen Kusama's Aeon Flux (2005)this contribution seeks to understand how the historically inflected spatial dimension of its urban imaginary has translated into a discernibly dark and spectacularly gendered film style.									0	0	0	0	0	1206-3312		WOS:000346262500004

By examining the tenuous position that police officers occupy (e.g., of state actor one moment and nonstate actor the next), it unpacks the state-society contradictions embodied by police. More directly, this article argues that state-society imaginaries are fraught with a host of epistemological tensions and that police work-and, in particular, moments of conflict and police violence-shows clearly the problems and abuses engendered by binary state-society frameworks. Through a case study of a favela community (low-income urban settlement) in northeast Brazil, it illustrates how distance between the state and civil society-and the discretion state actors hold over nonstate actors-relates to moments of police violence and ongoing abuse.									0	0	0	0	0	0004-5608		WOS:000343668200008		
J	Leman, Peter								Law and Transnational Utopias in East African Fiction								INTERVENTIONS-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POSTCOLONIAL STUDIES				16	6	SI		818	836		10.1080/1369801X.2014.936957			NOV 2 2014	2014	This essay offers a reading of utopian and dystopian imaginaries in East African fiction in the context of both spatial theory and cultural legal studies. Focusing on Kusadikika by Shabaan Robert (1951) and Wizard of the Crow by Ngugi wa Thiong'o (2006), my analysis meets the spatial turn in critical theory at the point where it has recently intersected with both law and African studies. At this nexus, we find, among other things, the figure of utopia. Traditionally conceived in temporal terms (i.e. as a future ideal), utopias in Robert and Ngugi's texts develop as uniquely spatialized visions of possible futures. Furthermore, whereas scholars have discussed the extent to which utopia is or is not compatible with law - i.e. is utopia formed through the perfection of law or its complete absence? - these narratives depict law as essential to both dystopia and utopia, its presence and necessity almost taken for granted. This suggests that the question we should ask, therefore, is not 'Is there law in utopia?' (the answer will always be 'yes') but 'Where is law in utopia?' In other words, the location or spatiality of law is essential to a society's status as either utopian or dystopian. In examining the interrelationships of these different phenomena, my ultimate purpose in this essay is to try to make sense of the coincidence of a spatially oriented utopian impulse and questions of law and territorial redefinition in Robert's and Ngugi's texts. I ask: What can we make of the intersection of law and utopia in East African narratives whose setting, geographical location, or topos, at the threshold of the Indian Ocean lends itself to thinking transnationally, or even post-nationally? Is there such a thing as a 'transnational utopia'? Or is the transnational in its global capitalist manifestations necessarily a form of dystopia?									0	0	0	0	0	1369-801X		WOS:000344473700004

Rather than seeing democracy as a form of government that has overcome the need for imagination and symbols, he shows in the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus that an enlightened state depends on three myths: the myth of the sovereignty of the people so as to reconcile democracy as rule by the people with each individual living as he or she wants to live; the myth that we are a people, emotionally and morally tied to some people more than to others; and, finally, the myth that the people comprises individuals who are responsible for their own destinies. The democratic imagination differs from earlier forms of politics in that the people construct the social imaginary for themselves and are guided by it without deception. It is the social imaginary thus created, or these three myths, that make room for freedom of thought and therefore for democracy.									0	0	0	0	0	1084-8770		WOS:000343408100002

The training was followed by a test in which the observers searched for a new target that was identical to one of the former distractors. The new distractor set consisted of the remaining former distractors plus the former target. On each trial, three letter strings were displayed, which included the target string with a probability of 0.5. In Experiment 1, the strings were centered at different locations on the circumference of an imaginary circle around the fixation point. The training phase of Experiment 2 was similar, but in the test phase of the experiment, the strings were located in a vertical array centered on fixation, and in target-present arrays, the target always appeared at fixation. In both experiments, performance (d') degraded on trials in which former targets were present, suggesting that the former targets automatically drew processing resources away from the current targets. Apparently, the two experiments showed automatic attraction of visual attention by supraletter features of former target strings.									0	0	0	0	0	1664-1078		WOS:000345578100001	25505892

J	Favoretto, Mara; Wilson, Timothy								Los ángeles de Charly: entre el ser nacional ideal del Proceso de Reorganización Nacional y el ser real del rock nacional argentino	Charly's angels: between the idealized ser nacional of the Argentine Proceso and the demythologized ser nacional of Argentine Rock							Per Musi					30			53	63		10.1590/S1517-75992014000200008			2014-12	2014	From its very beginning, the Argentine Proceso dictatorship ("Proceso de Reorganización Nacional") of 1976-1983 proposed a single "Argentine Way of Life" ("ser nacional argentino"), a national identity to be shared by all Argentines, which was based on an exaggerated ideal of the Hispanic tradition: a strong heterosexual masculine figure and a submissive and obedient female figure. In its declarations and official communiqués, the Proceso regime attempted to recreate an imaginary past, which amounted to a caricature of classic ideals such as the "Angel of the home" ("Angel del hogar"), and the "Latin Honor Code". But this repressive machinery of censorship and propaganda was countered by another "machine," a rock band headed by Charly García called La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros. The poetic discourse of the La Máquina subtly contradicted that of the regime, at a time in which any dissent was extremely dangerous. In this study, we shall analyze the monolithic and idealized discourse of the ser nacional, which the regime imposed, in contrast to the more realistic and polyphonic vision of national identity as seen in the lyrics of Charly García's songs. Whereas the regime bombarded Argentines with rhetoric about obedient wives and daughters, in La Máquina songs, women are protagonists: heroines, goddesses, and dancers. García replaces the nineteenth-century "Angel of the home" proposed by the regime with his own angels: the independent women of the twentieth century.	Desde su inicio, la dictadura argentina que se auto-denominó el Proceso de Reorganización Nacional se propuso la consolidación de un único ser nacional, una identidad nacional compartida por todos los argentinos, que se basaba en una exagerada e idealizada visión de la tradición hispánica de la figura heterosexual masculina fuerte y la figura femenina sumisa y obediente. En sus declaraciones y comunicados oficiales, el Proceso intentaba la reinstauración de valores correspondientes a un pasado imaginado, que constituía casi una caricatura de ideales clásicos como el "ángel del hogar" y el "código de honor". Pero esta represiva maquinaria censora y propagandista vio su contrapunto en otra "máquina": nace en los mismos días que el Proceso una banda de rock del músico Charly García llamada La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros. El discurso poético de La Máquina contradecía sutilmente el discurso del régimen, en momentos en que era sumamente peligroso disentir. En este trabajo se analiza el discurso del ser nacional ideal, que el régimen militar intentaba imponer por la fuerza, en contraste con el ser nacional real que contraponían las letras de las canciones de Charly García. En contra del rol tradicional de esposas e hijas obedientes que se bombardeaba desde el discurso oficial, en las canciones de La Máquina de Hacer Pájaros, las mujeres eran protagonistas: heroínas, diosas, y bailarinas. En lugar del "ángel del hogar" que proponía el Proceso, los "ángeles" en las canciones de García son las mujeres independientes del siglo XX.								0	0	0	0	0	1517-7599		SCIELO:S1517-75992014000200008		
J	CAPRISTANO, Cristiane Carneiro; OLIVEIRA, Elaine Cristina de									ESCRITA INFANTIL: A CIRCULAÇÃO DA CRIANÇA POR REPRESENTAÇÕES SOBRE GÊNEROS DISCURSIVOS							Alfa : Revista de Linguística (São José do Rio Preto)				58	2			347	370		10.1590/1981-5794-1405-4			2014-12	2014	This work aims at discussing children's imaginary circulation through representations of discursive genres. More specifically, this research investigates how the circulation of such representations is shown in the children's projections for one or more of the addressees of their enunciations. The concept of discourse genre proposed by Bakhtin (2000) is adopted. The analysis of these selected children's written enunciations favored a specific and constitutive trait in order to define genre: the fact that the relatively stable types of enunciations have always an address and a direction (BAKHTIN, 2000). Starting from the concepts of addressing and of "other"- the latter one based on Authier-Revuz (1982, 1990) - it is suggested that, in spoken enunciations, individuals need to negociate with others elements (other wordings, other registers, other meanings and also other addressees) which constitute them and whichdetermine the emergence of their produced enunciation. The analysis of the children's enunciations showed that two important and interlinked facts should be observed: the non-univocity and the fluctuation about the addressing of the enunciations.		O propósito deste artigo é o de refletir sobre a circulação imaginária das crianças por representações sobre gêneros discursivos. Tem-se como objetivo mais específico investigar como a circulação por essas representações mostra-se na projeção que a criança faz de um (ou mais) destinatário(s) para o (seu) enunciado. Para a realização deste estudo, assume-se o conceito de gênero do discurso como proposto por Bakhtin (2000). Na análise dos enunciados escritos infantis selecionados, privilegiou-se um traço, essencial e constitutivo, dessa definição de gênero: o fato de os tipos relativamente estáveis de enunciados terem, sempre, um direcionamento, um endereçamento (BAKHTIN, 2000). Partindo dos conceitos de endereçamento e de outro - este último segundo a proposta de Authier-Revuz (1982, 1990) -, supõe-se que, em enunciações escritas ou faladas, o sujeito precisa negociar com os outros (outros dizeres, outros registros, outros significantes e, também, outros destinatários) que o constituem e determinam a emergência dos enunciados que produz. A análise dos enunciados infantis permitiu observar dois fatos importantes e interligados: a não univocidade e a flutuação no endereçamento desses enunciados.							0	0	0	0	0	1981-5794		SCIELO:S1981-57942014000200347

J	Cohen, Esther; Pat-Horenczyk, Ruth; Haar-Shamir, Dafna								Making Room for Play: An innovative Intervention for Toddlers and Families Under Rocket Fire								CLINICAL SOCIAL WORK JOURNAL				42	4	SI		336	345		10.1007/s10615-013-0439-0			DEC 2014	2014	Evidence from both clinical reports and empirical research suggests that symbolic play may help heal children's traumas. Playfulness, an enduring individual characteristic, also contributes to resilience. However, trauma often sabotages children's ability to engage in imaginary play and parents' ability to be involved in playful interactions with their young children. This paper describes an innovative preventive group-intervention program by the name of NAMAL (Hebrew acronym for Let's Make Room for Play), designed for mothers and their toddlers who live under the chronic stress of recurrent missile attacks in Israel. The major objective of the program is to bolster children's resilience by enhancing their playful interactions with their mothers. The theme and activities of each session are organized around a saying with a relational or developmental message. Reports collected from 70 mothers after their participation in the program highlighted the success of the intervention and the changes in the children and parents, as well as in their interactions with each other. Follow-up interviews conducted a year after the intervention provided further information on the long-term positive effects of the program.									0	0	0	0	0	0091-1674		WOS:000344737700003		
J	Hudson, Pat								YY CORRESPONDENCE AND COMMITMENT BRITISH TRADERS' LETTERS IN THE LONG EIGHTEENTH CENTURY								CULTURAL & SOCIAL HISTORY				11	4			527	553		10.2752/147800414X14056862572069			DEC 2014	2014	A major question for historians of the eighteenth century is how traders, who were often strangers to each other, managed to establish the sense of mutual reliability that underpinned the expansion of credit, and of long distance trade. This article examines the role of commercial correspondence in this process, based on archives from different British regions and sectors of domestic and overseas trade. The form and functions of letters, their structure, handwriting, vocabulary, layout and phrasing, are examined. How merchants learned epistolary skills is also addressed: the role of didactic literature, education, training and experience/tacit knowledge. It is argued that commercial letters were both practical and imaginary. They acted as a commitment agent, reducing risk and uncertainty and lowering transaction costs. They also created communities of traders that transcended boundaries of culture and nationality in the interests of efficient commerce.									0	0	0	0	0	1478-0038		WOS:000344716200003

During the 1930s and 1940s, this folktale was used by the imperial authorities to justify the war against demonic Anglo-Americans. Little known is that the same story was also appropriated by Japanese orator-communists challenging imperialism and war capitalism. The article critically examines how the folk hero acquired class consciousness and became proletarian, critiquing the dominant ideology.									0	0	0	0	0	1479-1420		WOS:000345370500005		
J	Nieswand, Boris								The burgers' paradox: Migration and the transnationalization of social inequality in southern Ghana								ETHNOGRAPHY				15	4			403	425		10.1177/1466138113480575			DEC 2014	2014	Based on an ethnographic case study conducted in the Dormaa District, this article describes a group which has emerged in southern Ghana in the last decades and is called Burgers. Burgers are transnational migrants who have materially achieved a middle-class status in their country of origin by doing blue-collar jobs in Western Europe or North America. Their emergence as a class highlights the links between transnational migration, global inequalities and national imaginaries of social status. Since their relative wealth lacks conventional legitimations, these migrants are a cause of irritation to existing imaginaries of social status in Ghana. In this context, redistribution of resources and collaborative silences are central to understanding how Burgers negotiate their status and convert money into symbolic capital.									0	0	0	0	0	1466-1381		WOS:000345334700001		
J	Ferretti, Federico								Inventing Italy. Geography, Risorgimento and national imagination: the international circulation of geographical knowledge in the nineteenth century								GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL				180	4			402	413		10.1111/geoj.12068			DEC 2014	2014	This paper addresses the construction of national unity by Italian geographers in the age of the Risorgimento, analysing this process within the context of the international emergence of national representations, identities and imaginaries which was similarly accompanied by geographers elsewhere during the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Based on primary sources, focusing on European circulation of knowledge, and drawing on the study of the cultural and epistemological construction of the geographical objects, this paper contributes to current research on nationalism, identities and national imagination from the standpoint of social, cultural and historical geography. Interrogating how geography constructed objects of cultural identity in Italy, initially through landscape and morphologic analysis, and finally in the geographical invention of the Italian nation, reveals the importance of this discipline for constructing social reality. The study of the role of geography historically in nation-building can shed light both on territorial challenges of the past, and those potentially to come.									0	0	0	0	0	0016-7398		WOS:000345210000012

J	Shidlovski, Daniella; Schul, Yaacov; Mayo, Ruth								If I imagine it, then it happened: The Implicit Truth Value of imaginary representations								COGNITION				133	3			517	529		10.1016/j.cognition.2014.08.005			DEC 2014	2014	Imagination sometimes leads people to behave, feel, and think as though imagined events were real even when they know they were not. In this paper, we suggest that some understanding of these phenomena can be achieved by differentiating between Implicit Truth Value (ITV), a spontaneous truth evaluation, and Explicit Truth Value (ETV), a self-reported truth judgment. In three experiments, we measure ITV using the autobiographical Implicit Association Test (Sartori, Agosta, Zogmaister, Ferrara, & Castiello, 2008), which has been used to assess which of two autobiographical events is true. Our findings demonstrate that imagining an event, like experiencing an event, increases its ITV, even when people explicitly acknowledge the imagined event as false (Experiments 1a and 1b). Furthermore, we show that imagined representations generated from a first-person perspective have higher ITV than imagined representations generated from a third-person perspective (Experiment 2). Our findings suggest that implicit and explicit measures of truth differ in their sensitivity to properties underlying truth judgment. We discuss the contribution of characterizing events according to both ITV and ETV to the understanding of various psychological phenomena, such as lying and self-deception. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Pollock, Anne								Places of pharmaceutical knowledge-making: Global health, postcolonial science, and hope in South African drug discovery								SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE				44	6			848	873		10.1177/0306312714543285			DEC 2014	2014	This article draws on ethnographic research at iThemba Pharmaceuticals, a small South African startup pharmaceutical company with an elite international scientific board. The word iThemba' is Zulu for hope', and so far drug discovery at the company has been essentially aspirational rather than actual. Yet this particular place provides an entry point for exploring how the location of the scientific knowledge component of pharmaceuticals - rather than their production, licensing, or distribution - matters. The article explores why it matters for those interested in global health and postcolonial science, and why it matters for the scientists themselves. Consideration of this case illuminates limitations of global health frameworks that implicitly posit rich countries as the unique site of knowledge production, and thus as the source of unidirectional knowledge flows. It also provides a concrete example for consideration of the contexts and practices of postcolonial science, its constraints, and its promise. Although the world is not easily bifurcated, it still matters who makes knowledge and where.									0	0	0	0	0	0306-3127		WOS:000345573700003	25608441	
J	Price, Sara								Professionalizing Midwifery: Exploring Medically Imagined Labor Rooms in Rural Rajasthan								MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY				28	4			519	536		10.1111/maq.12118			DEC 2014	2014	In India, globalized flows of biomedical discourse like evidence-based delivery practices (EBDs) and new technologies are reshaping the field of reproductive health care. As iterations of evidence-based medicine shift, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) increasingly act as distributive agents for biomedical projects that equate modernized health care spaces and provider-care techniques with a marked improvement in the safety of birth outcomes. In this article, I examine how particular local iterations of EBDs are distributed to skilled birth attendants (SBAs) who have become sites for globalized projects aimed at reshaping their professional designation. I draw on data collected through in-depth ethnographic interviews with SBAs practicing in health centers around southern Rajasthan to explore the dynamics and tensions surrounding the professionalization of midwives and the increasing promotion of EBDs in institutional labor rooms.									0	0	0	0	0	0745-5194		WOS:000345913200015	25042051

We show that these criticisms are based on fairly serious misunderstandings of the DEEPEN project, its interdisciplinary approachand its conceptual context. Having responded to Thorstensen's criticisms, we take the opportunity to clarify and develop our approach to narrative. We articulate the need for novel, theoretically robust approaches to the formation of public attitudes which transcend the limitations of both survey-based approaches-which remain wedded to methodological individualism and which presume that individuals hold distinct and relatively stable attitudes and preferences-and interactionist approaches to public talk, which focus too strongly on individuals-in-interaction as reasoning agents and which ignore the constitutive role of culture and discourse in the formation of public opinion. We suggest that our use of narrative can help to better understand the process through which public attitudes to emerging technology develop out of interactive an engagement with wider cultural arguments and accounts of science and technology. We finish by pointing to parallel developments in social thought-from Charles Taylor's treatment of social imaginaries to recent developments in post-Bourdieuian cultural sociology-as related projects in understanding the cultural resources and grammars that provide the conceptual infrastructure for modern social life.									0	0	0	0	0	1871-4757		WOS:000345772900004		
J	Sharp, Shane								Monotheistic Theodicy as Imaginary Face-Work								SOCIOLOGICAL FORUM				29	4			873	892		10.1111/socf.12124			DEC 2014	2014	In this article, I outline the cognitive process involved in accomplishing monotheistic theodicy, or the act of reconciling the belief in an omnipotent and morally perfect God with personal experiences of suffering. Based on in-depth interviews with intimate partner violence victims, I argue that believers accomplish monotheistic theodicy by performing imaginary face-workor protective face-work on the behalf of significant imagined othersthat saves God's face as a morally perfect being. Believers perform this imaginary face-work by constructing accounts that portray God as morally innocent of their suffering. These accounts fall into three main types: (1) fidelity to a higher principle, (2) ultimate benefit, and (3) shifting blame. These accounts serve as new cognitions that resolve the cognitive dissonance and concomitant negative emotions believers experience because of their suffering. Overall, the findings and analysis contribute to sociological theory by further extending the concepts of face and face-work to imagined others.									0	0	0	0	0	0884-8971		WOS:000345853700006

The essence of this proposal is the recognition of nature as a subject holding rights. Adopting a discourse analytical perspective, this article analyzes the advocacy activities for the UDRME at Rio+20 and critically reconstructs the arguments in favor of the Rights of Nature, which condense deliberations about value, humans' role on Earth, the planet's physical characteristics, indigenous and traditional people's wisdom, and the evolution of legal systems. The most prominent aspects of this argumentative endeavor are discussed to assess how a previously unthinkable international environmental normative framework became conceivable. The article contends that connections with long-standing environmental discourses and the enactment of the indigenous speaker position by UDRME advocates are central for understanding how this proposal has become part of contemporary environmental politics.									0	0	0	0	0	1070-4965		WOS:000346889200001

She notes that scholarship on Christianity has increasingly focused on broader cultural themes in lieu of a more strict concern with churches as institutions in their own right. Maffly-Kipp's challenge reminded me of a particular context in the history of Christianity: the eighteenth-century city-state of Ogua (or, more familiarly, Cape Coast), in present-day Ghana. In the 1750s, the family of a local youth sent their child, Philip Quaque, to study abroad in London under the auspices of the Anglican Church. The young Quaque spent the next eleven years of this life cultivating expertise in Anglican liturgy, Christian theology, and British mores. Before returning home in his early twenties, he was ordained to the Anglican priesthoodthe first African to have done so.									0	0	0	0	0	0009-6407		WOS:000347234200008

Self-Consciousness and Social Anxiety in Youth: The Revised Self-Consciousness Scales for Children								PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT				26	4			1292	1306		10.1037/a0037386			DEC 2014	2014	Despite the established relationship between self-consciousness (SC) and anxiety and depression in adults, there is a paucity of research examining SC in children and adolescents. We therefore sought to examine the factor structure, reliability, and validity of scores for a revised version of the Self-Consciousness Scales for Children, a measure of SC in youth. The Revised Self-Consciousness Scale for Children (R-SCS-C) was examined in 2 studies using a community sample of children and adolescents. In the 1st study, 1,207 youth (685 girls) ages 7 to 18 completed the R-SCS-C as well as measures of imaginary audience, anxiety, depression, and positive and negative affect. Results of an exploratory factor analysis of the R-SCS-C conducted on a randomly selected subsample (n = 603) supported a 3-factor solution, including the subscales of Public Self-Consciousness, Private Self-Consciousness, and Social Anxiety. A subsequent confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) conducted on the remaining half of the sample (n = 604) revealed that this model fit the data well. Additionally, subsequent multigroup CFAs by gender and age demonstrated good model fit across both gender and younger (ages 7 to 12 years) and older (ages 13 to 18 years) cohorts. In the 2nd study, 245 youth completed the R-SCS-C twice, approximately 2 weeks apart. The R-SCS-C scores in these samples demonstrated acceptable internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity, and test-retest reliability. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	1040-3590		WOS:000346698200023	25068912

J	Wastell, David								Archarios: A Dialogue Between Socrates and a Novice Manager on the Relevance of Design to Management Practice and Education								ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT LEARNING & EDUCATION				13	4			641	652		10.5465/amle.2013.0169			DEC 1 2014	2014	Concerns about relevance to practice have prompted calls for a new approach to management education (and research) based on a reconceptualization of management praxis as design. Since a landmark colloquium convened by Boland and Collopy in 2004, interest in "design thinking" has gained ground in both the academic and practitioner communities. This has led to some notable educational innovations, but overall progress remains desultory, and the danger arises that design thinking may be seen as another management fad. This essay reports an imaginary dialogue between Socrates and a novice manager (Archarios) that reaffirms the continuing relevance of the design perspective in management education and practice. Design science is well-established in the field of information systems (IS), and it is argued that IS research provides a valuable repository of design theory and techniques. The dialogue provides real illustrations, from health and social care in the UK, of "design disasters" which could have been averted had managers adopted a "design attitude" and followed principles of good design methodology in their professional practice.									0	0	0	0	0	1537-260X		WOS:000347409700010		
J	Cristofari, Cecile; Guitton, Matthieu J.								Mapping virtual communities by their visual productions: The example of the Second Life Steampunk community								COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR				41				374	383		10.1016/j.chb.2014.10.017			DEC 2014	2014	In the digital age, the identities and structures of virtual communities develop outside the traditional definitions of geography and physical constraints. Among the best models to study the identification process in virtual communities are the communities of fans of imaginary universes. Steampunk-neo-Victorian fiction with a science fiction twist has for instance given rise to a large community, which is very active both in real life and in virtual spaces, for instance in the online 3D immersive platform Second Life. By collecting and analysing hundreds of visual artifacts generated by members of the steampunk community of Second Life, we found a repertoire of visual and lexical characteristics with which to identify the community. In addition, examining the characteristics displayed by visual productions from other communities allowed us to map relationships between different communities based on their aesthetics. This data suggests that the quantification of visual clues points out to interlocking relationships between different community aesthetics, forming a network where differences are visible, but fluidity still dominates. Furthermore, our results could serve as a model to study how communities in different media (immersive universes, games, social media based on visual materials such as Pinterest or Instagram) generate their own visual identity.

J	Gultekin, Mustafa								Folk-Tale Teller Kezban Karakoc from Balikesir in Context of Localization, Performance and Bodylore								MILLI FOLKLOR					104			46	59					WIN 2014	2014	The folktale is one of the most studied topics in the folk literature. Specifically, in the folk tale studies conducted in Turkey, it is noteworthy that text-based theories and methods are generally preferred and used. Text-based approaches are observed not only in the study of folk tales but also in the determination and identification process of the characteristics of folk tales. The folk-tale, which is defined as a genre where made-up and imaginary events are told and the folk-tale tellers are also sidelined because of such text-based approaches. Yet, like every people-based product, folk tales are associated with the narrator's biography, her perspectives, stance, and social context, and she definitely reflects these on her tales. Moreover, storytelling is not merely a text transfer, but it is a social and communicative phenomenon on which certain functions are loaded in the framework of certain conventions, and it also includes processes like the use of voice, gestures and facial expressions of the folk-tale teller and reactions of the audience. In this study, by using forty one folk tale samples compiled from Kezban Karakoc, a folk-tale teller from Balikesir, as the benchmark, the narrator's effects on the narration and the interactions and communications emerging between the narrator and the audience are analyzed. The problem of localization of the tales in general or specifically by the narrator has been detected in the samples taken from the narrator's repertoire. In addition, whether the narrator's gestures and facial expressions during the narrations can be considered as bodylore was discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	1300-3984		WOS:000347496100004

We held collective interviews with three groups of students, using the Drawing-Story with Theme Procedure as a facilitating resource. We gathered, in this method, 47 drawings. Such communication was considered interpretively, according to the psychoanalytical method, and allowing the creation of four affective-emotional fields: "Mechanical failure", "Until death do us part", "Who am I?" and "Rejection". The bigger picture reveals a conservative imaginary, from which prejudicial and excluding behavior can emerge, and which persists despite undeniable victories from social movements focusing on gender issues.	Tuvimos como objetivo investigar psicoanalíticamente el imaginario colectivo de estudiantes de Psicología en relación a las dificultades sexuales, teniendo en cuenta que las quejas relativas al campo sexual de la vida humana son comunes en la práctica psicológica.

These two new granadian creoles were joined in their scientific training and professional location, Jose Celestino Mutis and they took up the branch of the Royal Botanic Expedition of New Granada (1783).The method focused on the social history of science and the used methodology was sustained in the compared history sustained in indicators of analysis as: formation, professional trajectory, political participation and analysis of the excellent speeches that they pronounced in the process of the independence. The sources were located in files of Spain, Colombia and Venezuela. To conclude, the political life of these two botanits is joined together in a political speech with the enlightened thinking of promoting a change in the education and the industry development and trade where the useful sciences to the study of the natural resources of their homeland marked the course of the new design for the imaginary Nation of the creole elite of new Granade.

These systems, however, are based on questionable principles, for two reasons. First, analyzing the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) and the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) from a pedagogical point of view, one cannot but notice that they are inherently flawed by contradictions and confusion of different perspectives. Second, these contradictions increase the difficulty for parents who buy video games to understand the rating. This is a considerable drawback, as parents and child caregivers should be the primary targets of such rating systems. This article offers a critical examination of the European PEGI and the North American ESRB rating systems, and, starting from this analysis, suggests improvements that could make video game rating systems more appropriate in terms of their function as parental guidance.									0	0	0	0	0	1555-4120		WOS:000346205300005		
J	Fitzgerald, Des; Callard, Felicity								Social Science and Neuroscience beyond Interdisciplinarity: Experimental Entanglements								THEORY CULTURE & SOCIETY				32	1			3	32		10.1177/0263276414537319			JAN 2015	2015	This article is an account of the dynamics of interaction across the social sciences and neurosciences. Against an arid rhetoric of interdisciplinarity', it calls for a more expansive imaginary of what experiment - as practice and ethos - might offer in this space. Arguing that opportunities for collaboration between social scientists and neuroscientists need to be taken seriously, the article situates itself against existing conceptualizations of these dynamics, grouping them under three rubrics: critique', ebullience' and interaction'. Despite their differences, each insists on a distinction between sociocultural and neurobiological knowledge, or does not show how a more entangled field might be realized. The article links this absence to the regime of the inter-', an ethic of interdisciplinarity that guides interaction between disciplines on the understanding of their pre-existing separateness. The argument of the paper is thus twofold: (1) that, contra the regime of the inter-', it is no longer practicable to maintain a hygienic separation between sociocultural webs and neurobiological architecture; (2) that the cognitive neuroscientific experiment, as a space of epistemological and ontological excess, offers an opportunity to researchers, from all disciplines, to explore and register this realization.									0	0	0	0	0	0263-2764		WOS:000346188000001

Specifically, we explore how these policies and dynamics play out spatially in the context of two Charlotte neighborhoods, both of which have similar historical roots and have become magnets for Latino settlement, yet display divergent contemporary place-making paths. Our exploration reveals the ways in which contexts of receptivity and spaces of both exclusion and inclusion are created by the socio-spatial components of public policy and the localized response to that policy at the intraurban level. Reinforcing the importance of space and place in the construction of receptivity contexts, the compared stories of Eastside and South Charlotte reveal that neighborhoods are never the product of one transformational force but of manyno matter how they may be perceived in the public imaginary.									0	0	0	0	0	0016-7428		WOS:000346473500001

It places these within the context of past and current debates on the human rights of common prisoners, as distinct from those of political ones. Yet precisely the omission of the political is mirrored at the prison-malls in the architectural erasure of territorial marks of repression (the cells) but also of all material traces of a poetics of freedom within the site, such as a window through which political prisoners had once successfully plotted a mass escape. These erasures can be read, I suggest, within a program of invisibilization of acts of freedom in the reconfiguration of memorial practices and places. Here, I want to ask, How are escapes being remembered/forgotten in current sites of memory, where the dominant imaginary neutralizes political content? Can we conceive of an architecture of affect that would relate to memories of escape?									0	0	0	0	0	1750-6980		WOS:000346903300006		
J	Ten Eycke, Kayla D.; Mueller, Ulrich								Brief Report: New Evidence for a Social-Specific Imagination Deficit in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder								JOURNAL OF AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS				45	1	SI		213	220		10.1007/s10803-014-2206-7			JAN 2015	2015	Previous research suggests that children with autism have deficits in drawing imaginative content. However, these conclusions are largely based on tasks that require children to draw impossible persons, and performance on this task may be limited by social deficits. To determine the generality of the deficit in imagination in children with autism, we asked 25 children with autism (mean age 9;7) and 29 neurotypically developing children (mean age 8;7) to draw an imaginative person and house. Drawings of imaginary houses by children with autism did not differ from those by neurotypically developing controls, but drawings of persons were significantly less imaginative. These findings suggest that the impairment in imagination among children with autism may be specific to social stimuli.									0	0	0	0	0	0162-3257		WOS:000347691700018	25103864

In approaching the life and work of Stuart Hall through the incommensurate scales of personal and political histories which run simultaneously across and between the three screens, I argue that this installation enacts something we might call the intellectual aesthetic of the project of British Cultural Studies.

We ask how class difference and poverty politics are made and remade in neighborhood-level place-making and with what implications for boundaries and alliances between middle-class and poorer residents. Place-making refers to activities through which residents work to produce the neighborhood they want, such as participating in community organization or initiatives, interacting with their neighbors, and supporting or opposing particular changes in the neighborhood. We use a relational poverty framework to show that middle-class place-making reproduces normatively white middle-class place imaginaries but always also produces poverty and class politics. We extend prior research on middle-class poverty politics, which focuses primarily on class boundary making, to investigate whether progressive, alliance-building moments ever emerge. Drawing on case study research with two Seattle neighborhoods, we trace the ways in which place-making practices situate middle-class and poorer actors in relation to one another. We show that these interactions might continue to govern poverty and poorer people but might also challenge normative understandings of poverty and sow the seeds for cross-class alliances. Through comparative analysis of the neighborhoods as dense sites of class formation, we show how particular histories, place imaginaries, and built or institutional infrastructures allow (or foreclose) questioning and reworking of normative class and race formations and poverty politics to pave the way for cross-class alliance.									0	0	0	0	0	0004-5608		WOS:000346244200007		
J	Lingard, Bob								Thinking About Theory in Educational Research: Fieldwork in philosophy								EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY				47	2	SI		173	191		10.1080/00131857.2013.793928			JAN 28 2015	2015	This article responds to and reflects upon the articles in this special issue. Specifically, it deals with the usage of theory in each of the articles, what we might see, as examples of re-descriptive usage in autonomous theorizing. The articles utilize different theories and varying intellectual resources-Foucault and Deleuze (Richard Niesche), Bourdieu (Carmen Mills), Levinas (Sam Sellar) and Butler (Christina Gowlett)-to analyse the topic of the My School website and associated new accountabilities in Australia schooling. This article argues that their usage of the My School website must be seen as a condensation symbol to signify a broader neo-liberal agenda in Australian schooling that has global as well as national elements to it. The fact that the social today is no longer straightforwardly homologous with the nation also challenges 'methodological nationalism' and suggests the pressing need to 'deparochialize' theory in research and reject a reading of Northern theory as universal. The article uses the provocations of these articles to reflect upon the necessity of theory in educational research more generally, and to consider its usage in research with different purposes, while accepting that theory should be endemic in all stages of research. Theory serves a different purpose in research with different goals; quantitative correlational research demands theory to move to explanation, interpretive research requires theory to strengthen interpretation and plausibility, while critical research utilizes theory to uncover the hidden as a step towards emancipation. These articles implicitly suggest alternative forms of accountability and politics, but I argue in conclusion that, additionally, we need a broader politics that will move us towards a non-utopian post neo-liberal social imaginary.									0	0	0	0	0	0013-1857		WOS:000346829100006		
J	Fotopoulou, Aristea; Couldry, Nick								Telling the story of the stories: online content curation and digital engagement								INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY				18	2			235	249		10.1080/1369118X.2014.952317			FEB 1 2015	2015	This article explores tensions between the imaginaries and material hindrances that accompany the development of digital infrastructures for narrative exchange and public engagement. Digital infrastructures allow civil society organizations to become narrators of their community lives, and to express solidarity and recognition. Often full development and implementation of such infrastructures result in drastic changes to an organization's mode of operation. Drawing from empirical material collected during an action research project with an organization of community reporters in the North of England, here we examine the visions of 'telling the story of the stories' that motivated such changes, the experiments in web analytics and content curation that in practice realized these visions and the socio-economic contexts that constrained them. We attend to the wider social imaginaries about the digital as they help us understand better how social actors construct the worlds they want to inhabit within information society through mundane everyday practices. Examining how perceptions of digital engagement translate into such concrete practices is necessary in order to gain insight into the ways in which material infrastructures, such as resources and technologies, intertwine with social and cultural expectations about how life should be with digital technologies.									0	0	0	0	0	1369-118X		WOS:000343230000008		
J	Ladegaard, Jakob								Cowboys and Vampires Eastern European Encounters in New American Fiction								ORBIS LITTERARUM				70	1			32	66		10.1111/oli.12046			FEB 2015	2015	During half of the twentieth century, the socialist states in Eastern and Central Europe functioned as a political Other that helped shape collective identities in the USA. The collapse of the socialist regimes in the early 1990s opened up a new territory for economic, personal and imaginary investments. This territory was soon explored by a number of American novels: John Beckman's The Winter Zoo (2002), Dave Eggers's You Shall Know Our Velocity (2002), Jonathan Safran Foer's Everything Is Illuminated (2002), Jonathan Franzen's The Corrections (2001), William Gibson's Pattern Recognition (2003), Arthur Phillips's Prague (2002) and Gary Shteyngart's The Russian Debutante's Handbook (2002). This article argues that in these novels post-communist Eastern Europe functions as a region off the symbolic map, a wilderness, often violent, replete with traces of an insistent past. The novels often view the American travellers' encounters with this landscape through the codes of the American Gothic and Western genres. Thus, the novels frame their investigations of the legacy of authoritarianism, the possibility of cross-cultural encounters and the consequences of globalisation in literary modes that ultimately refer back to an American cultural tradition and give rise to critical reflections on the formation of American identity after the Cold War.									0	0	0	0	0	0105-7510		WOS:000347236600002		
J	Villate-Isaza, Alberto								From 'cuadro de costumbres' to Nationalist Tool: The Case of El carnero in the Colombian Literary Canon								BULLETIN OF SPANISH STUDIES				92	2			235	254		10.1080/14753820.2014.943025			FEB 7 2015	2015	Juan Rodriguez Freile's historiographical text known as El carnero, although written in 1636, was not published until 1859. The more than 200 year circulation of the text in manuscript form conditioned the way it was discussed after its publication. Rodriguez Freile's text, therefore, provides an interesting example of the double function, or 'uses', of literature in the construction of nationalistic projects. On the one hand, El carnero helped to cement a unified concept of community in the collective imaginary; and, on the other, it became an institutionalized tool that legitimized the concept of community and presented it as a well-defined historical narrative of national identity. This essay situates the publication of El carnero within the larger preoccupation of the Colombian intellectual elite who sought to define what constituted an 'autochthonous literature', which, in turn, was constructed in order to represent a set of national customs. The publication and inclusion of El carnero into the literary canon coincided with the change in the criticism regarding the text's style: it came to be considered an indication of the formation of a national character that could be traced all the way to the development of an autochthonous literature rooted in the colonial period.									0	0	0	0	0	1475-3820		WOS:000346049600004

The increasing role of mass media, particularly television, as political mediator has led to a vast reconfiguration of sociocultural and political imaginaries as a consequence of the way in which the latter render the real in virtual or spectacular terms. This article will examine the cognitive transformations and appropriations of the concept of reality caused by spectacularization, as seen in Argentine novelist Sergio Bizzio's Realidad (2009). I contend that the novel's use of a series of concepts and discursive techniques possessing a metafictional character not only exposes mass media's appropriation of mechanisms that produce meaning and shape reality, but ultimately resists criteria and codes of representation at the literary level as well.									0	0	0	0	0	1475-3820		WOS:000346049600006

On the lookout for deconstruction, we think with Derrida around the interrelated self/other and familiar/strange binaries that uphold the perfect stranger. We argue that Eurocentrism simultaneously centres and obscures whiteness, resulting in teachers' misconceptions about culture. We also demonstrate how stereotypical representations of the 'imaginary Indian' that these white teachers 'know' inhibits their ability to foster and build upon relationships with Indigenous students. We conclude by conceptualizing a model for teacher education that, through a variety of teaching practices and policies, intentionally disrupts and destabilizes the perfect stranger position.									0	0	0	0	0	1361-3324		WOS:000347531700006

This article revisits multiculturalism as an intervention in the discourse of decline, shifting the terms of the multiculturalism debate from the abstract struggle between competing political ideologies, to the minor material processes through which multiculturalism was enacted. Through a Foucauldian analytics of governmentality, we examine in particular the invention and evolution of multicultural arts over the last 30 years. We attend to the multiple ways in which cultural difference has been mobilised and understood by policy-makers and the constituents they served; how these various framings of cultural difference informed the shifting objectives and constituencies of multicultural arts; and how these shifts were influenced by the dispersed nature of policy formation, crossing multiple sites and stakeholders, each subject to, but also resisting and reshaping, the discursive parameters of this category. Such an approach dismantles the coherence and stability of multiculturalism upon which the discourse of decline is premised, but also anticipates the way multiculturalism is presently transforming in response to a transnational, neoliberal cultural imaginary.									0	0	0	0	0	1028-6632		WOS:000347708600007
