Although a better understanding of the experience of illness and therefore a better response to the patient's needs have often been stressed, no studies have yet investigated the paediatricians' insight into their IBD adolescent patients.Methods:A group of adolescents (ages 12-19) diagnosed as having IBD was administered a questionnaire listing 22 items of concern. They were asked to rank each item on a 5-point scale according to the degree of effect on the quality of their everyday life. The same questionnaire was administered to a group of paediatricians experienced in treating IBD and to a group of paediatric residents. Paediatricians and residents were asked to estimate how much each item would affect the quality of an average patient's life, according to the same scale. The questionnaire was also used in a face-to-face approach, asking a paediatrician to apply the estimation to an individual patient, instead of an average imaginary one.Results:Fifteen paediatric gastroenterologists, 11 paediatric residents, and 28 patients (female:male=16:12; median age 16.3 years) took part in the study. The majority of patients experienced Crohn disease (17 vs 11 with ulcerative colitis). We found only 6 items overlapping when comparing the top 10 items ranked by patients and paediatricians. The patients' number 1 concern occupies the ninth position in the paediatricians' list. The number 1 item for paediatricians is not even mentioned in the patients' top 10 list. Overall, both paediatricians' and residents' rankings were significantly higher than those given by patients.Conclusions:We found a significant misalignment in the estimation of health concerns between IBD adolescent patients and their paediatricians. A better insight into IBD patients' worries and concerns is crucial for the improvement of the patient's quality of life and disease outcome.									1	0	1	0	1	0277-2116		WOS:000326744500017	23403446

We will look into some of the ideological and theoretical problems that inevitably rise if one wants to use Bachelard's topoanalysis today I want to argue that these difficulties are far from insuperable and that an alternative approach to Bachelard's legacy is still possible and Worthwhile. If we consider Bachelard's exploration of the images of dwelling as a variant of what Jerome McGann coined "deformative criticism," Bachelard's project can still be used as a relevant methodological instrument for a critical analysis of the imaginary of interior spaces.									0	0	0	0	0	2041-9112		WOS:000334967200001		
J	Elliot, Esi Abbam; Cherian, Joseph; Casakin, Hernan								Cultural metaphors: Enhancing consumer pleasure in ethnic servicescapes								JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH				66	8	SI		1004	1012		10.1016/j.jbusres.2011.12.024			AUG 2013	2013	This paper explores how cultural metaphors in ethnic servicescapes enhance consumer pleasure. To date, marketing researchers have mainly explored how consumers respond to ambient conditions, functional layout and signs/symbols within servicescapes. However, few studies are available on consumer pleasure in ethnic servicescapes or the use of cultural metaphors in servicescapes to enhance consumer pleasure. The study here extends extant literature by contributing an additional dimension of pleasure named "ethno-pleasure." This notion relates to consumer emotional responses to the cultural metaphors in the servicescapes associated with cultural self-construal. The three themes relating to ethno-pleasure include symbolic experience, imaginary experience, and reviving experience. Findings from this study have implications for assisting marketers in developing strategies for multi-cultural marketing.

J	Bonomo, Mariana; Souza, Lídio de								Representações hegemônicas e polêmicas no contexto identitário rural	Hegemonic and polemic social representations in the context of rural identity [TC]	Representaciones sociales hegemónicas y polémicas en el contexto de identidad rural [TC]						Avances en Psicología Latinoamericana				31	2			402	418					2013-08	2013	The objective of this study is identifying the rural and the urban representations leading to an understanding of how members of the rural community see themselves in relation to the hegemonically urban social and symbolic structure. The data was collected through interviews with 200 members of a rural community, covering the following topics: reasons for exodus from/permanence in the territory, experience of prejudice, stereotypes attributed to rural group and in/out-group values. The results in terms of reasons for exodus from/permanence in the rural area revealed a predominance of life projects linked to the countryside. The classic stereotypes of hick, dumb, country bumpkins were identified as the social image linked to the rural dweller, elements that provoke strategic scenarios in conflict with the elaboration of defensive representations, where the in-group is associated to positive values and the city to negative values. The imaginary group is viewed as a force field where polemic representations are elaborated in answer to urban hegemony.	El objetivo de este estudio es conocer las representaciones de lo rural y lo urbano con el intento de comprender cómo miembros de una comunidad rural se posicionan frente a la estructura social y simbólica hegemónicamente urbana. Se obtuvo el conjunto de datos a través de entrevistas a 200 integrantes de una comunidad rural, contemplando los siguientes núcleos de información: motivaciones para éxodo/permanencia en el territorio, experiencia de prejuicios, estereotipos atribuidos al grupo rural, y valores endo/exo-grupales. Los resultados referentes a las motivaciones para el éxodo o permanencia en el campo revelaron el predominio del proyecto de vida vinculado a lo rural. Los clásicos estereotipos de roceiros, bobos y caipiras fueran identificados como la imagen social del hombre del campo, elementos que producen el escenario conflictivo estratégico a la elaboración de representaciones defensivas, siendo el endogrupo rural asociado a valores positivos, y la ciudad, a significados negativamente valorizados. Se discute el imaginario grupal como campo de fuerzas en el que se elaboran representaciones polémicas en respuesta a la hegemonía urbana.

J	Wilkinson, Iain								The provocation of the humanitarian social imaginary								VISUAL COMMUNICATION				12	3	SI		261	276		10.1177/1470357213483061			AUG 2013	2013	This article reviews recent attempts to analyse the visibility that is brought to human suffering within social imaginaries' committed to humanitarian concerns. It questions the conventions of critique that operate to cast the humanitarian social imaginary as a negative development within our political culture. It is designed to encourage a more critically reflexive and historically informed approach to the work of critique. It also argues that it is possible to trace a tradition in which humanitarian campaigners operate with the aim of appropriating the critical reaction to their work as part of their political strategy. In this regard, campaigners are more concerned to provoke moral controversy than to fashion winning arguments'. Here the visualization of human suffering is valued more for its potential to generate value conflicts than for the extent to which it serves as an authentic or ideologically uncontaminated representation of social reality.									1	0	0	0	1	1470-3572		WOS:000321440200002		
J	Chouliaraki, Lilie								The humanity of war: iconic photojournalism of the battlefield, 1914-2012								VISUAL COMMUNICATION				12	3	SI		315	340		10.1177/1470357213484422			AUG 2013	2013	This article examines the changing ethics of war photojournalism. It provides a review of the major paradigms of war communication studies, propaganda and memory studies, to argue that, despite their contributions, neither focuses on historical change in the ethics of war. In the light of an analytical discussion of iconic images of the First World War and Second World War as well as the War on Terror in terms of how they portray the battlefield the article argues that there is a historical shift towards an increasingly explicit visualisation of war, which today tends to emphasise the emotional, rather than physical, impact of the battlefield upon both soldiers and civilians. This shift, it concludes, reflects the contemporary political context of humanitarian wars fought with a view to alleviating suffering, rather than wars fought over national sovereignty.									0	0	0	0	0	1470-3572		WOS:000321440200005

BCI using imaginary movements: The simulator								COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE				111	2			300	307		10.1016/j.cmpb.2013.04.008			AUG 2013	2013	Over the past two decades, much progress has been made in the rapidly evolving field of Brain Computer Interface (BCI). This paper presents a novel concept: a BCI-simulator, which has been developed for the Hex-O-Spell interface, using the sensory motor rhythms (SMR) paradigm. With the simulator, it is possible to evaluate how the model parameters such as error classifications, delay between classifications and success rate affect the communication rate. Another advantage of the simulator is that it allows us to study for more classes than most online BCI systems which are limited to only two classes. Results show that the BCI simulator is able to give a deeper understanding of the feedback systems. We also find that a 3-class system is more efficient than a 2-class system if it obtains a success rate of at least 55% of the 2-class system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Facchini, Francois								Economic freedom in Muslim countries: an explanation using the theory of institutional path dependency								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS				36	1			139	167		10.1007/s10657-011-9250-y			AUG 2013	2013	This article explains the level of economic freedom in Muslim countries through the theory of institutional path dependency. Islamic countries are generally not free and they have a poor record regarding property rights. To explain these realities we use the institutional history of Muslim countries. We define three steps: the Arab and Ottoman Empires when Islamic law was of great importance, European colonisation, and the contemporary era with its movement towards a revival of Islam. Islamic law is not liberal. This explain why in general Muslim countries are not free. Colonisation radically changed institutional life in the twentieth century. British colonisation proved to be better than did French or Soviet colonisation. This explains why the Persian Gulf countries are freer. The collapse of the Soviet model explains the speed of liberalisation in former socialist countries (such as Albania, Kyrgyz Republic, and Kazakhstan). Nevertheless, the twentieth century was not just the century of Westernisation. It was also the century of the revival of Islam. The article concludes that the history of the twentieth century does not explain the way in which Muslim countries are attracted by the ideal of the Muslim city. The revival of Islamic intellectual innovations and the evolution of Muslim opinion sustain this thesis. Therefore, there is a dependency on the past and on an imagined future. Islam acts, like yesterday, on the world of institutional possibilities.									0	0	0	0	0	0929-1261		WOS:000321967700008

The tendency towards envisioning stable, seamless, uniform and universally available media, communications and information systems, and infrastructures is as old as the field of ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) itself, as are critiques identifying the blind spots of these visions. As an alternative to the most recent iteration of these visions - cloud computing - I introduce the notion of minor urbanism', a conceptual vehicle for understanding the complex assemblages of actors, practices and situations brought into being by real-world ubicomp. I then describe the emergence of white-label' ATMs as an example of such an assemblage, one that articulates an alternate ontology for describing contemporary entanglements of people, technology and space in the context of everyday urban life. I conclude by introducing a work of design fiction that richly illustrates these entanglements and indicates a strategy by which the public imaginary of near-future urban technologies can be shaped along these lines.									0	0	0	0	0	1030-4312		WOS:000322753900002

J	Walsh, Victoria								Reordering and Redistributing the Visual: The Expanded "Field' of Pattern-Making in Parallel of Life and Art and Hammer Prints								JOURNAL OF VISUAL CULTURE				12	2	SI		222	244		10.1177/1470412913492398			AUG 2013	2013	In August 1954, the artist-photographer Nigel Henderson and the sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi set-up Hammer Prints Ltd to sell and promote their designs for wallpapers, curtains and ceramics. Marginalised by art history as a category of applied arts, Hammer Prints was, however, inextricably tied into the ideas and experimental cross-media work of both artists at this time. This article resituates the ethos and designs of Hammer Prints within the wider aesthetic concerns and strategies of the Independent Group which the two artists were engaged with and, in particular, to the reordering of the visual first proposed by the artists in collaboration with the architects Alison and Peter Smithson in the seminal exhibition Parallel of Life and Art (Institute of Contemporary Arts, 1953), the year before Hammer Prints was established. As the article argues, a more complex account of Hammer Prints exists once it is reconnected to both artists' interest in gestalt principles of perception, contemporary theorisations of pattern', and ontological questions of art posed by Malraux's idea of the imaginary museum' and Duchamp's idea of the portable museum'. It concludes by locating the designs of Hammer Prints within the new field of communication theory developed by Gregory Bateson.									0	0	0	0	0	1470-4129		WOS:000322819800003		
J	Jukic, Tatjana								THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH Ziek and the Balkans								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENGLISH STUDIES				17	2	SI		160	175		10.1080/13825577.2013.797198			AUG 1 2013	2013	Slavoj Ziek's view of the Balkans has recently been critiqued as procolonial, in that he casts the Balkans as the unconscious of Europe and therefore deprives it of the cogito, which remains definitive of Europe. This critique, with its Cartesian and Lacanian implications, bears on the very constitution of Ziek's critical gesture, because it tends to homogenise both psychoanalysis and the philosophy Lacanian psychoanalysis engages with into colonialism. Taking up Ziek's Marx, particularly the way in which his Marx comes together with the Balkans in The Fragile Absolute, I argue that the Balkans in Ziek traces the metonymic logic of the international which dehomogenises Europe to begin with and displaces the logic of colonialism. What emerges instead is a political imaginary where Ziek's Lacanian script registers a shift towards configurations formative to the work of Deleuze: the shift mobilised already in Ziek's engagement with Hitchcock's cinema where Hitchcock labours as the specimen story of Ziek's philosophy cum psychoanalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	1382-5577		WOS:000323143900005

Photography's relation to urban memory suggests the existence of appearances rather than realities captured in public spaces, particularly, in those appearing in the 30s and 40s in Santiago, Chile. By having studied six magazines from those decades, it is possible to create a visual speech describing those appearances that, at the same time, unveil the predominance of the urban project and the architectonic piece of more than one block size above the idea of a plan, being the latter understood as a structured exercise in the space and projected in time.									0	0	0	0	0	0718-2309		WOS:000323083300012		
J	Darling, Jonathan								Moral urbanism, asylum, and the politics of critique								ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A				45	8			1785	1801		10.1068/a45441			AUG 2013	2013	The city of Sheffield was the UK's first 'City of Sanctuary', an identification which suggested that the city would act to welcome asylum seekers and refugees through promoting a 'culture of hospitality'. In this paper I seek to interrogate such claims and explore how the promotion of a language of hospitality marks a form of 'moral urbanism' through which the city is linked to specific values and obligations that enable the governmental ordering of responses to asylum. In exploring public statements, media discussions, and interview accounts of asylum in the city, I argue that a normative account of how to live with asylum is articulated, one which establishes expectations of both citizens and noncitizens alike. The paper opens by tracing this narrative construction of Sheffield as a place with a 'welcoming tradition' through a series of high-profile events of refuge and their reiterative embedding in the public imaginary. I then question this account through demonstrating how such moments of welcome are conditioned by logics of acceptability and control, before considering how the governmental entanglements of moral urbanism might be contested through a politics of critique.									1	0	0	0	1	0308-518X		WOS:000323862700003		
J	Picken, Felicity								From designed spaces to designer savvy societies: the potential of ideas competitions in willing participation								ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A				45	8			1963	1976		10.1068/a45460			AUG 2013	2013	The design of public space has gained importance as cities are increasingly positioned in global flows of people, capital, and ideas. These spaces speak to the culture of a place as much as to the quality of its design, but the implementation of design as an inclusive process is fraught with difficulty. This is particularly pertinent in discussions about better ways of engaging people with urban design, where there is often a language barrier between those who specialise in spatial manipulation and the broader 'society' that uses this space. This paper gives an empirical account of how a spatial consciousness can be translated to society through an international design competition. The competition method of urban design relies upon promotion and 'eventfulness', both of which interpolate the public and contribute towards the generation of a deeper interest in the spatial imaginary of city planning. The creation of 'urban design consumers' through the visual consumption of the designs themselves offers an alternative way to gain public interest to the established traditions of public notices and formal public meetings. In this case, the competition extended the activity of urban designers beyond the mechanics of 'space production' to include 'consumer production' where a more intimate relationship between city planning and the people began to emerge.									0	0	0	0	0	0308-518X		WOS:000323862700013

The aims are to elucidate what these connectives, by means of discursive transversality, reveal about the interdiscourse with the established imaginary; to retrieve what was previously said, produced before, elsewhere and independently, which perpendicularly crosses the discourse produced in the deictic axis of the here and now; and to access the supporters that guide the joints between parts of an utterance.

Self-reported health is the dependent variable. Age, gender, education, employment status, self-mastery, income, autonomy at work, ties to family and friends, subjective social status, associational memberships and sense of national belonging are considered.Results. - At baseline, risk ratios reflecting movement from the 25th to 75th percentile in the distribution of the variable indicate that increases in income reduce the likelihood of poor health (0.78; 0.73-0.82) as does higher autonomy at work (0.90; 0.85-0.94) but so does access to social resources reflected in ties to family and friends (0.89; 0.86-0.92), associational memberships (0.93; 0.89-0.98), subjective social status (0.77; 0.54-0.90) while the absence of feelings of national belonging increases the likelihood of poor health (1.14; 1.06-1.23).Conclusion. - The results suggest that population health is dependent on the distribution of social as well as economic resources along the dimensions predicted by a capabilities model. Governments should be attentive to the impact of policy on the distribution of social, as well as economic, resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Future images in premodern Korea depended on social and political status. The ruling class had a Confucian utopia based on remote places and the golden age of ancient Chinese regimes. On the other hand, the oppressed, denied the Confucian ideal society, sought a classless society without oppression. In modern Korean society, five alternative images of the future can be identified: (a) becoming a developed country, (b) apocalyptic discourse, (c) national unification, (d) advanced information society, and (e) feminist visions. Unlike the future images from pre-modern Korea, those in Korea's modern era reject the ideal past, imaginary present, and radically different future.

J	Espinosa Blas, Margarita								La nación a debate: el discurso nacionalista en la prensa liberal antiporfirista	The nation debate: the nationalist discourse in the liberal anti-Porfirian press							Memorias: Revista Digital de Historia y Arqueología desde el Caribe					20			138	158					2013-08	2013	In Mexico, as in most Latin American states, the nation building process was so slow, painful and bumpy, that for many scholars national processes were still unfinished in the twentieth century. In the Mexican case, the porfiriato is considered as the national-state consolidation stage which made possible the unification of a successful national narrative, until it was interrupted by the Mexican Revolution. However, beyond the achievements and the apparent consensus among the political class of the porfirian era, national issues generated controversial debates in the press and in open forums. Faced with the national image built by the oligarchic and political elite, a certain sector of the press, associated with liberal opposition groups, questioned the arguments of the nation imagined by the ruling elite, but also reinforced some aspects of that national image, deeply rooted in the social imaginary. This text analyzes and explains a part of this debate through the study of the Mexican journalistic discourse in the period 1890-1910, particularly in those opposition newspapers identified with liberal ideology such as El Hijo del Ahuizote and others considered as harbinger of the Mexican Revolution such as Regeneración and El Demócrata.	En México, como en la mayoría de los estados latinoamericanos, el proceso de consolidación nacional fue lento, penoso y accidentado; tanto que para muchos estudiosos los procesos nacionales resultan inacabados aún en el siglo XX. En el caso mexicano se considera al porfiriato como la etapa de consolidación del estado-nacional en la que fue posible la unificación de un relato nacional exitoso pero interrumpido con la Revolución Mexicana. Sin embargo, más allá de los logros y del aparente consenso entre la clase política porfiriana, la cuestión nacional generó polémicos debates en la prensa y en la tribuna. Frente a la imagen nacional construida por la elite oligárquica y política, cierto sector de la prensa vinculado con grupos de oposición liberal cuestionó los argumentos de la nación imaginada por la élite en el poder, pero también reforzó algunos aspectos de esa imagen nacional arraigados en el imaginario colectivo. En este trabajo se analiza y explica una parte de este debate a través del estudio del discurso hemerográfico mexicano del periodo 1890-1910, particularmente en aquellos diarios de oposición identificados con el ideario liberal como El Hijo del Ahuizote y otros considerados precursores de la Revolución Mexicana como Regeneración y El Demócrata.								0	0	0	0	0	1794-8886		SCIELO:S1794-88862013000200007		
J	Perez, Michelle Salazar; Cannella, Gaile S.								Situational Analysis as an Avenue for Critical Qualitative Research: Mapping Post-Katrina New Orleans								QUALITATIVE INQUIRY				19	7			505	517		10.1177/1077800413489514			SEP 2013	2013	Hypercapitalism in the United States and globally has created neoliberal conditions that have reinterpreted notions of the public good as an entrepreneurial endeavor. In this current context, critical qualitative methods such as situational analysis combined with theoretical perspectives like Black feminist thought can provide activist methodological tools to expose and reenvision privatized constructions of the common good. In this article, we describe possibilities for using critical situational analysis to examine a broad range of complex conditions and provide examples of situational mapping from a study focusing on disaster capitalism and the privatization of the public education system in post-Katrina New Orleans. We then offer possibilities for using situational analysis to create new imaginaries for critical qualitative inquiry.									0	0	0	0	0	1077-8004		WOS:000322155800004

J	Oklopcic, Zoran								Beyond Empty, Conservative, and Ethereal: Pluralist Self-Determination and a Peripheral Political Imaginary								LEIDEN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW				26	3			509	529		10.1017/S0922156513000216			SEP 2013	2013	Over the last couple of years, a stream of pluralist theories of international legal order has developed at the intersection of international law and political theory, having immediate implications for conceptualizing self-determination. The understanding of self-determination under the framework of bounded, constitutional, and radical pluralism markedly departs from the previous wave of normative theories in the 1990s: self-determination is now evacuated from the field of national pluralism and struggles over territory.This article does not question the thrust of pluralists' recent work, but complements their critical attunement to global disparities of power, and complicates their neglect of nationalism and rejection of territorial reconfigurations as self-determination's core meaning. In doing so, it unearths two visions that come from the (semi-)periphery of the international political order. The first belongs to Edvard Kardelj, pre-eminent Yugoslav theorist of socialist self-management and the Non-Aligned Movement. The second belongs to Leopold Sedar Senghor, the poet and politician, advocate of negritude, a proponent of French West African integration, and a constitutional advocate for the reconfiguration - not abolition - of the French Union, the heir to the French Empire. While they are suspicious of extensive territorial reconstruction, like contemporary pluralists, unlike them they have seen a role for territorial reconfigurations in the name of national plurality.									0	0	0	0	0	0922-1565		WOS:000322526300002		
J	Beckert, Jens								Capitalism as a System of Expectations: Toward a Sociological Microfoundation of Political Economy								POLITICS & SOCIETY				41	3			323	350		10.1177/0032329213493750			SEP 2013	2013	Political economy and economic sociology have developed in relative isolation from each other. While political economy focuses largely on macro phenomena, economic sociology focuses on the embeddedness of economic action. The article argues that economic sociology can provide a microfoundation for political economy beyond rational actor theory and behavioral economics. At the same time political economy offers a unifying research framework for economic sociology with its focus on the explanation of capitalist dynamics. The sociological microfoundation for understanding of capitalist dynamics should focus on the expectations actors have regarding future states of the world. Based on a discussion of what I call the four Cs of capitalism (credit, commodification, creativity, and competition), I argue that under conditions of uncertainty, expectations are contingent and should be understood as fictional expectations. The capability of humans to imagine future states of the world that can be different from the present is the central basis for a sociological microfoundation of the dynamics of economic macro phenomena. Macroeconomic dynamics are anchored in these fictional expectations, which create motifs for engaging in potentially profitable but ultimately incalculable outcomes. This shifts attention to the management of expectations as a crucial element of economic activity and to the institutional, political, and cultural foundations of expectations. The reproduction of capitalism is precarious also because of the contingency of expectations conducive to its growth.									2	0	0	0	2	0032-3292		WOS:000322196400001

The paper highlights the political expediency of the Arabic text showing how Choukri challenges the rhetorical violence of silencing the Moroccans in European and American accounts by casting them in roles of natives/Muslims outside discourses of citizenship in the modern city. Most fully, the following analysis illustrates how Choukri uses realist representation to engage with the city's spheres of monetary circulation and social indifference to unsettle totalizing representations of Tangier's cosmopolitanism. Finally, the paper reexamines dismissive Arab critics' reception of the text, arguing for the necessity of reimagining it in relation to discourses of the modern city.									0	0	0	0	0	0034-5210		WOS:000322685800007		
J	Zittoun, Tania; Cerchia, Frederic								Imagination as Expansion of Experience								INTEGRATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE				47	3			305	324		10.1007/s12124-013-9234-2			SEP 2013	2013	This paper proposes a developmental view on imagination: from this perspective, imagination can be seen as triggered by some disrupting event, which generates a disjunction from the person's unfolding experience of the "real" world, and as unfolding as a loop, which eventually comes back to the actual experience. Examining recent and classical theorization of imagination in psychology, the paper opposes a deficitary view of imagination to an expansive notion of imagination. The paper explores Piaget, Vygotsky, Harris and Pelaprat & Cole consider: 1) What does provoke a "rupture" or disjunction? 2) What are the psychological processes involved in the imaginary loop? 3) What nourishes such processes? 4) What are the consequences of such imaginary loop, or what does it enable doing? The paper proposes to adopt an expansive view of imagination, as Vygotsky proposed-a perspective that has been under-explored empirically since his seminal work. To stimulate such sociocultural psychology of imagination, two empirical examples are provided, one showing how children make sense of metaphor in an experimental setting, the other showing a young person using a novel met at school as symbolic resource.									3	0	0	0	3	1932-4502		WOS:000323246600001	23625542	
J	Woolley, J. Patrick								KAUFMAN'S DEBT TO KANT: THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE OF THE "STRUCTURE OF THE WORLD WHICH ENVIRONS US"								ZYGON				48	3			544	564		10.1111/zygo.12032			SEP 2013	2013	Gordon Kaufman's constructive theology can easily be taken out of context and misunderstood or misrepresented as a denial of God. It is too easily overlooked that in his approach everything is an imaginary construct given no immediate ontological statusthe self, the world, and God are products of the imagination. This reflects an influence, not only of theories on linguistic and cultural relativism, but also of Kant's ideas of pure reason. Kaufman is explicit about this debt to Kant. But I argue there are other aspects of Kant's legacy implicit in his method. These center around Kaufman's engagement with observed patterns in nature. With Paul Tillich's aid, I bring this neglected issue to the fore and argue that addressing it allows one to more readily capitalize upon the Kantian influence in Kaufman's method. This, in turn, encourages one to tap more deeply into the epistemic underpinnings of Kaufman's approach to the science-religion dialogue.									0	0	0	0	0	0591-2385		WOS:000323393800004

Their story telling is leavened with a dissonant working imaginary designed to interrupt both itself and the stories. As their stories of their digital lives proceed, however, the carefully contrived, resourceful dissonance unexpectedly recedes as the new and surprising digital lives that form part of their collectives evade the grasp of their interrupting tool.									0	0	0	0	0	1359-1835		WOS:000323896500006

In his opinion they both step into the analyst's work with his patient on the level of his inner fantasy and to different degrees according to the various moments in the work. He points out that the common element between the infantile experience and the analytic one is the enormous opportunity for profound introjection. There are important moments that favor introjection in the young analyst's training course which establish and constitute the cultural, theoretical and clinical foundations of his working ego and of his working self. The importance of a thoroughly analyzed separation process from the personal analyst and from the supervisors during the analysis is strongly emphasized.									0	0	0	0	0	0178-7667		WOS:000324097800005		
J	Zhang, Lin; Fung, Anthony								The myth of "shanzhai" culture and the paradox of digital democracy in China								INTER-ASIA CULTURAL STUDIES				14	3			401	416		10.1080/14649373.2013.801608			SEP 1 2013	2013	This article analyzes the Internet-based campaign for the shanzhai Spring Festival Gala in connection with the rise of digital democracy and the burgeoning economy of grassroots culture in China. Emerging as a bottom-up challenge to the political and economic monopoly of CCTV's annual Spring Festival Gala, the campaign rode on the popular myth of shanzhai culture, which captured people's imagination for its associations with grassroots digital democracy. By depicting how different social players appropriate the narratives of shanzhai to construct a collective social imaginary of democracy, the article explores the specific formation of an Internet-facilitated shanzhai democracy, arguing that the myth of shanzhai currently enables and confounds political resistance in China. It nurtures a political subjectivity that encourages the instrumental marriage of affective emotion, populist anarchism, and commercial self-branding and publicity, and cultivates a shanzhai democracy that thrives on the commodification of politics and the monetization of the netizen's and the public's affective labor. The myth of shanzhai reflects the contested nature of digital democracy in contemporary China, marking a transitional space, a symbiotic relationship with power, and a fluid frontier to be constantly redefined and defended.									0	0	0	0	0	1464-9373		WOS:000324087600005

Political projects, changing urban-rural relations and mediating investment: insights from exploring dairying and Auckland's spatial planning in New Zealand, Regional Studies. The paper outlines recent attempts by New Zealand geographers to influence the balance of knowledge-power relations in decisions concerning the urban-rural environment in contemporary New Zealand. It argues for a link between situated knowledge' and geographical imagining' to strengthen understandings about the mobilization of strategic narratives or political projects' around visions of futures. These ideas inform a genealogy of significant moments in rural-urban relations, and enquiry into political projects at work in a national mini-conference on competition over land use. The paper concludes that framing changing rural-urban relations through the lenses of situated knowledge, geographical imaginaries and political projects greatly extends geographical insights and the capability to engage constructively in investment mediation in new ways.									2	0	0	0	2	0034-3404		WOS:000323919100003

The persistence of differences long after Asia was incorporated into the capitalist world-economy has led to a cartographic definition of the continent. Such definitions do not allow for historical processes that reshape relations between peoples, forging new links and severing old ones. This article traces the changing imaginaries of Asia historically. Since there are no indigenous conceptions of the continent, the author argues that the changing imaginaries of Asia are linked to wider geopolitical processes. When eastern Eurasia was subordinated to the drives of the capitalist world-economy, existing linkages were severed and territories were linked to, or through, colonial metropoles. After a brief period of autarkic development after decolonization, states along the Pacific coasts were increasingly integrated through production and procurement networks leading to a new imaginary of Asia. Since the end of the cold war and the emergence of independent states with large hydrocarbon resources in Central Asia, countries that were once excluded from cold war imaginaries of Asiaas well as Indiaare being integrated through newer imaginaries that reflect the greater prominence of China and India today as well as the rise of Islamic militancy and new ethnic conflicts.									0	0	0	0	0	1467-2715		WOS:000323998300004		
J	Candela, Ana Maria								QIAOXIANG ON THE SILK ROAD Cultural Imaginaries as Structures of Feeling in the Making of a Global China								CRITICAL ASIAN STUDIES				45	3			431	458		10.1080/14672715.2013.829314			SEP 1 2013	2013	The contemporary era of globalization poses challenges for reimagining Asian nations once associated with the ThirdWorld as spaces within the global capitalist world. The idea of the Global South incorporates these nations into a new post-cold war global imaginary, but does so in a way that recognizes the structural and social inequalities that continue to distinguish these nations from their more privileged counterparts in the Global North. The challenge of reimagining former ThirdWorld nations in the contemporary era of globalization is further complicated by the deepening of structural inequality within those nations. Growing class divides and uneven development in these nations have made it difficult to imagine Global South nations as homogenous entities. This article explores the complexities of imagining China in the era of globalization by examining a set of historical narratives: the Silk Road and qiaoxiang (sojourner villages), which emerged as strategies for situating China within new global imaginaries by re-narrating the histories of South China. Although the narratives mark a departure from nation-centered histories of the Mao era, they do not reflect a withering of the state or of nationalism in the face of globalization. Rather, they are connected to reconfigurations of the nation and state related to the challenges of managing the nation's current phase of capitalist development. By examining the ways in which these narratives are over-determined by shifting class formations, regional economic development strategies, place-based social and cultural legacies, global intellectual trends, and state interventions, which all shape South China's economic development, this article describes the function of these narratives as structures of feeling. As such, the Silk Road and qiaoxiang narratives give voice to the anxieties produced by China's opening to the capitalist world economy and attempt to reconcile the contradictions of China's current phase of economic development by rendering a complex social reality into historically recognizable forms.									0	0	0	0	0	1467-2715		WOS:000323998300006		
J	Karrar, Hasan H.								MERCHANTS, MARKETS, AND THE STATE Informality, Transnationality, and Spatial Imaginaries in the Revival of Central Eurasian Trade								CRITICAL ASIAN STUDIES				45	3			459	480		10.1080/14672715.2013.829315			SEP 1 2013	2013	The end of the cold war witnessed the emergence of a commercial web sprawling from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region in western China and extending into Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan), Pakistan, and Russia. Running parallel to the state-managed exchange in hydrocarbons, raw materials, technology, and infrastructure, this new Eurasian trade had an informal component as everyday consumer items manufactured in China were imported into neighboring countries, bypassing formal regulatory mechanisms. This inter-Asian trade began as shuttle trading by itinerant merchants for local markets; by the mid 1990s, shuttle trading was overshadowed by largescale export for national markets in neighboring countries without losing its informal character. This informality extending across national boundaries defined the post-cold war commerce in innermost Asia; at the same time, it also signaled a return to pre-cold war trading structures. Moving away from the retreat of the state thesis that found traction following the cold war, the author attributes informality in this inter-Asian trade to three factors: (1) a restructuring of state power where informal trade was a new comparative advantage sought in an evolving geopolitical climate; (2) the actors in this inter-Asian tradeparty and regional officials in China, along with traders and intermediarieswho found and exercised agency through this exchange; and (3) a chain of inter-locking, commercial macro-regions, which are economically sustainable and which transcended international boundaries. Working in conjunction, these factors constitute a dynamic inter-Asian trade and challenge static state imaginaries of a New Silk Road or Eurasian Continental Bridge.									0	0	0	0	0	1467-2715		WOS:000323998300007

Campaigns and experiences such as Make Poverty History, the gap year and the mainstreaming of fair trade all shape the ways in which Northern publics understand and respond to development issues. This is significant as established ideas of rich and poor are challenged and reinforced through austerity in the Global North, discourses around the rising powers and the closing of spaces for critical public debate on development. Research with the NGO CAFOD (Catholic Agency for Overseas Development) illustrates the ways social relations and identities interweave with development imaginaries in the Global North. A drawing together of postcolonial and cosmopolitan perspectives provides a starting point for rethinking scholarship and curricula in this area.									0	0	0	0	0	0225-5189		WOS:000324978200004		
J	Dawson, Ashley								EDWARD SAID'S IMAGINATIVE GEOGRAPHIES AND THE STRUGGLE FOR CLIMATE JUSTICE								COLLEGE LITERATURE				40	4	SI		33	+					FAL 2013	2013	Can viable links be established between environmental justice activists from communities in climate chaos-threatened locations in the Global North and communities of what the environmental historian Ramachandra Guha calls "ecosystem people" in the Global South? In order for such transnational links to be forged, new forms of empathy and solidarity need to be fostered that extend our political imaginary beyond the dominant geographic scales of the past-the city, nation, or region-without collapsing into a sweeping and abstract planetary universalism. Such a process of rewriting will entail an ability to see established geographies as the product of social struggles, as ways of imagining the world in order to cement or to contest hegemony. Geography, as Edward Said consistently argued, never simply involves describing the world, but rather is an inescapably political practice of world-making through representation. Considering Said alongside figures such as Antonio Gramsci and C. L. R. James, the essay argues that Edward Said's work on what he called "imaginative geographies" blazed a path for the political and theoretical project that confronts the movement for climate justice today.									0	0	0	0	0	0093-3139		WOS:000325381900003

In the present study, we implemented voxel-based real-time coherence measurements in a rtMEG system in which we employed a beamformer to localize signal sources in the anatomical space prior to computing imaginary coherence. Our rtMEG experiment showed that a healthy subject could increase coherence between the parietal cortex and visual cortex when attending to a flickering visual stimulus. This finding suggests that our system is suitable for neurofeedback training and can be useful for practical brain-machine interface applications or neurofeedback rehabilitation.									1	0	1	0	1	0219-6352		WOS:000325279000002	24070057

Responding to Michael Burawoy's (2005, 2007) call for a "public sociology', the chapter reflects on how debates around public social sciences could enrich the political, institutional and conceptual location of migration studies in Costa Rica.									1	0	0	0	1	0141-9870		WOS:000324610700005

We draw on concepts from scalar politics and new regional geography, data collected as part of a collaborative event ethnography of CoP10, and interviews with Palauan delegates to theorize the enactment of an oceanic Pacific Region as a scalar strategy directed toward transcending the practical and imagined smallness of Pacific small island developing states (SIDS) within the CoP10 meeting context and global imaginations. We conclude that the Pacific Region construct enhances Pacific SIDS' capacity to participate in CoP10, although their collective influence remains relatively limited compared with others. Most significantly, the Pacific Region imaginary of a vast ocean space and network of people committed to the CBD and biodiversity conservation positions Pacific Islanders to play a pivotal role in conserving a significant portion of the world's oceans. In the context of increasing global attention to marine conservation, the enactment of such a Pacific Region is likely to aid in attracting international recognition, attention, and support. By conveying how and why a diverse group of state and nonstate actors enacted an international and oceanic region at CoP10, we contribute understanding of strategic regionalization within the scalar politics literature and further disrupt understandings of an ontologically given, land-based region conceptualized on continental or subcontinental spatial scales.									4	0	0	0	4	0308-518X		WOS:000325904900004		
J	Hannah, Matthew G.								ATTENTION AND THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL POLITICS OF LANDSCAPE								GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES B-HUMAN GEOGRAPHY				95	3			235	250		10.1111/geob.12023			SEP 2013	2013	This article argues that the inherent directedness of attention is a central and pervasive condition of politics across a wide range of social fields. The subfield of landscape geography serves as an occasion to illustrate what can be gained by attending to attention. The argument begins by reflexively placing the problematic of attention within a brief genealogy of constructions of modern perception. Within this frame, the article takes a closer look at the ambivalent and hesitant response to the problem of attention in phenomenology. This field is best positioned to give a foundational account of the political character of attention and to explain the sense in which its relevance transcends the era in which it was first clearly formulated. However, a strong upsurge of phenomenological interest in attention has only appeared in recent years. A review of this work, particularly in the writings of Bernhard Waldenfels, shows how attending to attention can deepen critical analyses of capitalism and spectacle offered by Benjamin, Debord, Ranciere and Beller. The final section of the article illustrates key points by staging an imaginary trip through the corporate agricultural landscapes of California.									4	0	0	0	4	0435-3684		WOS:000326182200003

Indeed the increasingly dire projections of increasing global average temperatures and escalating extreme weather events highlight the existential challenge that climate change presents for humanity. In this editorial article we outline how climate change not only presents real, physical threats but also challenges the way we conceive of the broader economic, political and social order. We asked ourselves (and the contributors to this special issue) how we can imagine alternatives to our current path of ever escalating greenhouse gas emissions and economic growth? Through reference to the contributions that make up this special issue, we suggest that critically engaging with the concept of social, economic and political imaginaries can assist in tackling the conceptual and organizational challenges climate change poses. Only by questioning current sanitized and market-oriented interpretations of the environment, and embracing the catharsis and loss that climate change will bring, can we open up space for new future imaginings.									2	0	0	0	2	1350-5084		WOS:000324402300001

These are shared socio-semiotic systems that structure a field around a set of shared understandings of the climate. Climate imaginaries imply a particular mode of organizing production and consumption, and a prioritization of environmental and cultural values. We use this concept to examine the struggle among NGOs, business and state agencies over four core climate imaginaries. These are 'fossil fuels forever', 'climate apocalypse', 'techno-market' and 'sustainable lifestyles'. These imaginaries play a key role in contentions over responses to climate change, and we outline three main episodes in the past two decades: the carbon wars of the 1990s, an emergent carbon compromise between 1998-2008 and a climate impasse from 2009 to the present. However, climate imaginaries only become dominant when they connect with wider popular interests and identities and align with economic and technological aspects of the energy system to constitute 'value regimes'.									2	0	0	0	2	1350-5084		WOS:000324402300002

While there is considerable scholarship on the films, there has been little consideration of Donald Swanson's varied career and output. This article shows how he participated in a network of documentary and colonial filmmakers in the late 1940s and early 1950s, first in Gaumont-British Instructional (GBI) and subsequently in African Film Productions (AFP). It builds on my earlier research and the recent recovery of two colonial films that he scripted and directed, Chisoko the African (1949) and Mau Mau (1954). Tracing Swanson's beginnings with the GBI series on British Railways for which he wrote two scripts, I identify key characteristics of his style and aesthetics. This leads into a discussion of the contexts within which GBI established its Africa office in Johannesburg; it was GBI's expertise in making films specifically for British audiences that led to the commission for Chisoko the African. I analyse the film, touch on its reception and consider evidence of Swanson's colonial imaginary which was characterised by a binary opposition between African primitivism and western civilisation. Finally, I note key aspects of his later work before drawing conclusions about the connected colonial film histories between Britain and Southern Africa; individual colonial film figures and their networks; and the importance of film in relation to histories of the late 1940s and early-mid 1950s. These contexts offer new perspectives on the appeal of African Jim and The Magic Garden for African audiences in South Africa.									0	0	0	0	0	0305-7070		WOS:000323919500014

Pataphysics, the science of exceptions and imaginary solutions, can be directly linked to creativity and is therefore very suitable to guide the transformation from relevant into creative search results. To enable pataphysical algorithms within our system we propose the need for a new type of system architecture. We discuss a component-based software architecture that would allow the flexible integration of the new algorithms at any stage or location and the need for an index suitable to handle patadata, data which have been transformed pataphysically. This tool aims to generate surprising, novel and provocative search results rather than relevant ones, in order to inspire a more creative interaction that has applications in both creative work and learning contexts.									0	0	0	0	0	1462-6268		WOS:000326780300007

J	Belleguic, Thierry								Jacques and His Master or the Eccentricities of the Narrative								LITTERATURE					171			54	+					SEP 2013	2013	"How had they met ? By chance, like everybody else." The incipit is famous, and places the narrative firmly under the control of the vagaries of chance. The situation is clear: everything, in Jacques the Fatalist, will be either interrupted or displaced, indefinitely differed. Which, as one might have guessed, is not without consequences for the reader. Taking the opposite line to a strictly structured narrative, explicitly refused by the author of Pensees sur l'interpretation de la nature (Thoughts on the Interpretation of Nature), Jacques the Fatalist stages an heuristic regime where what Diderot calls eccentricity, which must be understood, literally, as a care to take the unbeaten path, is given full freedom, in an exemplary survey of thought and knowledge which risks or better said bets on taking the wrong turn and thus both discovers and invents. The same insisting mode of writing, from the way the reader is lost in this "rhapsody of facts some real, others imaginary, written without grace and distribued without order", to the wrong turns taken by a master and a Jacques ceaselessly brought back to the same enigmatic cross-roads, pervades the heart of the fiction and points to possible meanings both affirmed and subverted, multiple, polymorphous, constantly reinvented through a fiction which is all the more "true" that it gives itself as such, all the more perverse that it reveals its mechanisms, creating thereby another fiction, that of a new subject of knowledge, which constantly need to be reinvented.									0	0	0	0	0	0047-4800		WOS:000326995100005

This deformation by the market has made NDiaye's previously more complex and oblique but less economically viable evocations of racialized "difference" somehow culturally digestible. Trois femmes puissantes, by being spectacularly hung on a largely imaginary hook named "Africa", lends itself to a cliche-ridden, neo-colonialist discourse, and is accordingly misrepresented, exoticized and commodified at every turn. Any genuine puissance the text itself might wield has been neutralized, sucked dry, and "dumbed down" by the powerful machine that is the Debordian "spectacle" of capitalist hegemony.									0	0	0	0	0	0004-9468		WOS:000328587600008

I rely on the many meanings of the word screen' to launch my analysis of the role of inflight entertainment in post-World War II air travel. Rather than examine the material displayed via inflight entertainment technologies, I take the installation of these technologies on aircraft as signifying particular attitudes airlines had toward their passengers, as well as larger struggles and negotiations over the meaning of travel. These coalesce in a cosmopolitan identity that takes the world to be easily accessible and readily visible, the desire of airlines to keep their passengers mollified and calm, and an emergent conception of travel as effortless activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0734-1512		WOS:000328471700006		
J	Konczal, Kornelia								At the crossroads between traditions, conceptions et interrogations: A brief history of the (dis)continuities in "memory studies" in Poland								REVUE D ETUDES COMPARATIVES EST-OUEST				44	3			125	+					SEP 2013	2013	Despite their long tradition, stimulating research methods and insights, Polish approaches to "memory studies" are not well known abroad. This discussion of the work of sociologists (such as Stefan Czarnowski, Nina Assorodobraj-Kula and Barbara Szacka) and historians (in particular those interested in "social imaginaries" and collective identities) challenges the well-established assumption that memory studies emerged in the 1970s. Exploration of the collective/social memory has a much longer tradition than is usually advanced. Furthermore, the range of research tools and analytical categories is much broader than suggested in dominant narratives about the history of memory studies. A short summary of the latest developments in this field completes this overview of the genealogy and history of memory studies in Poland during the 20th century.									0	0	0	0	0	0338-0599		WOS:000328658300007

I argue that, in the context of increasingly corporate management models, discourses of social responsibility, and specifically global citizenship, are not simply displaced or suppressed in spaces of higher education, but rather re-worked or re-packaged by administrations aiming to market university and college services and products to educational consumers. This is accomplished by representing global citizenship not only as an ethical-moral orientation but also as a marketable set of skills and certifications. At the same time, such conceptual framings of citizenship do not go uncontested by professors and students, rather a study of IDS programs highlights the presence of counter-hegemonic practice and potential within higher education and the need for alternative imaginaries of responsible global praxis.									0	0	0	0	0	0008-3658		WOS:000329198200014

Considerable literature details the promises and perils of neoliberalism in higher education. In the past decade, this has included the growth of interdisciplinary scholarship that explores the potential of critical pedagogy as a site of contestation in the higher education sector. In this context, the notion of critical pedagogy provides a dialogical and imaginative starting point for opening up spaces for what is otherwise denied or ignored. Although critical pedagogy is a big tent movement, a number of cogent and hard-hitting critiques have emerged highlighting its theoretical and political limitations. Concerns include the need for more attention to the complexities of how critical pedagogies are embodied or performed. This article argues that the performative dimension of critical pedagogy is important for putting into place the production of everyday spaces capable of transforming the boundaries of what is regarded as valid or legitimate knowledge and culture.									1	0	0	0	1	0008-3658		WOS:000329198200016

Painting and Poetry in Early Modern Spain: The Primacy of Venetian Colore in Gongora's Polyphemus and The Solitudes								RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY				66	3			904	936		10.1086/673586			SEP 2013	2013	Luis de Gongora's Fable of Polyphemus and Galatea (1612) and The Solitudes (1613) have inspired comparisons to painting ever since they first appeared in manuscript form at the Court of Philip III. Engaging the doctrine of ut pictura poesis, which notes the kinship between painting and poetry, Gongora creates pictorial conceits modeled in color as if using a painter's palette, and thus his poems read like imaginary art galleries. By way of both plastic and discursive references to the Venetian school, Gongora inserts his poetry into one of the most salient polemics of his time, the paragone tra colore e disegno, the debate over the supremacy of Venetian color versus Florentine draftsmanship. This essay seeks to provide a reading of Gongora's major poems in light of the paragone as it played out in seventeenth-century Spain among art theorists and painters such as Francisco Pacheco and Domenico Theotocopoulis (El Greco), and intertwined with related discourses pertaining to artistic progress and innovation, including the link between aesthetics and religious reform.									0	0	0	0	0	0034-4338		WOS:000330033900004

I argue that while much attention has been paid to proselytization as a catalyst in encouraging transnational activities among such Christians, more analysis is needed of how Pentecostalists represent each other in the construction of global imaginaries. The imagined and enacted networks that result assert connections between like-minded believers but also valorize the power of distance in the creation of landscapes of religious agency whose power is illustrated through such tropes as 'number', 'mobility', 'presence' and 'conquest'. I juxtapose two Prosperity-oriented movements, that of the Swedish Word of Life and the Nigerian Redeemed Christian Church of God, to indicate further how Christians who appear to be conjoined via common forms of worship appear, from another perspective, to be inhabiting and moving across disjunct global landscapes and cartographies as they engage in very different forms of mobility.									1	0	0	0	1	2077-1444		WOS:000330316600006

This is the main question that has guided our research and for which we propose a few answers. To that end, we have chosen three typical figures of Chilean society: the woman, the Peruvian immigrant and the person of Mapuche origin. According to the results of a previous study on this subject, all of them share the fact that they are potential victims of symbolic violence committed by sectors that, from a dominant position, practice "machismo", xenophobia, racism and classism. As these subjects develop varying degrees of consciousness with regard to the degrading, oppressive and vexing situations that they live, they conceive identity-based strategies which allow them to confront, with a major or minor degree of conflict, such manifestations of symbolic violence. The main advances of this research are presented in this article.									0	0	0	0	0	0034-9712		WOS:000330465400002

J	Delgado Saa, Jaime F; Cetin, Mujdat								Discriminative methods for classification of asynchronous imaginary motor tasks from EEG data.								IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society				21	5			716	24		10.1109/TNSRE.2013.2268194			2013-Sep	2013	In this work, two methods based on statistical models that take into account the temporal changes in the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal are proposed for asynchronous brain-computer interfaces (BCI) based on imaginary motor tasks. Unlike the current approaches to asynchronous BCI systems that make use of windowed versions of the EEG data combined with static classifiers, the methods proposed here are based on discriminative models that allow sequential labeling of data. In particular, the two methods we propose for asynchronous BCI are based on conditional random fields (CRFs) and latent dynamic CRFs (LDCRFs), respectively. We describe how the asynchronous BCI problem can be posed as a classification problem based on CRFs or LDCRFs, by defining appropriate random variables and their relationships. CRF allows modeling the extrinsic dynamics of data, making it possible to model the transitions between classes, which in this context correspond to distinct tasks in an asynchronous BCI system. On the other hand, LDCRF goes beyond this approach by incorporating latent variables that permit modeling the intrinsic structure for each class and at the same time allows modeling extrinsic dynamics. We apply our proposed methods on the publicly available BCI competition III dataset V as well as a data set recorded in our laboratory. Results obtained are compared to the top algorithm in the BCI competition as well as to methods based on hierarchical hidden Markov models (HHMMs), hierarchical hidden CRF (HHCRF), neural networks based on particle swarm optimization (IPSONN) and to a recently proposed approach based on neural networks and fuzzy theory, the S-dFasArt. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the improvements provided by our proposed methods in terms of classification accuracy.									0	0	0	0	0			MEDLINE:23807456	23807456

Frequency specific interactions of MEG resting state activity within and across brain networks as revealed by the multivariate interaction measure								NEUROIMAGE				79				172	183		10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.04.062			OCT 1 2013	2013	Resting state networks (RSNs) are sets of brain regions exhibiting temporally coherent activity fluctuations in the absence of imposed task structure. RSNs have been extensively studied with fMRI in the infra-slow frequency range (nominally <10(-1) Hz). The topography of fMRI RSNs reflects stationary temporal correlation over minutes. However, neuronal communication occurs on a much faster time scale, at frequencies nominally in the range of 10(0)-10(2) Hz. We examined phase-shifted interactions in the delta (2-3.5 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) frequency bands of resting-state source space MEG signals. These analyses were conducted between nodes of the dorsal attention network (DAN), one of the most robust RSNs, and between the DAN and other networks. Phase shifted interactions were mapped by the multivariate interaction measure (MIM), a measure of true interaction constructed from the maximization of imaginary coherency in the virtual channels comprised of voxel signals in source space. Non-zero-phase interactions occurred between homologous left and right hemisphere regions of the DAN in the delta and alpha frequency bands. Even stronger non-zero-phase interactions were detected between networks. Visual regions bilaterally showed phase-shifted interactions in the alpha band with regions of the DAN. Bilateral somatomotor regions interacted with DAN nodes in the beta band. These results demonstrate the existence of consistent, frequency specific phase-shifted interactions on a millisecond time scale between cortical regions within RSN as well as across RSNs.

J	Imai, Heide								The liminal nature of alleyways: Understanding the alleyway roji as a 'Boundary' between past and present								CITIES				34		SI		58	66		10.1016/j.cities.2012.01.008			OCT 2013	2013	This paper presents a study of the roji, a form of Japanese urban alleyway, which was once part of people's personal spatial sphere and everyday life, but has increasingly been transformed by diverse and competing interests. Marginalized through the emergence of new forms of housing and public spaces and re-appropriated by different fields, the social meaning attached to the roil is being re-interpreted by individuals, subcultures and new social movements to fit hybrid and multiple concepts of living and lifestyles. Focusing on the case of Tsukuda-Tsukishima in central Tokyo and drawing on ethnographic data supported by a conceptual framework derived from theories of place and place-attachment, this paper investigates the kind of functions the roil fulfilled in the city in the past, and the qualities of urban life that have been lost or changed as the alleyway has ceased to be an everyday part of the urban landscape. Providing multiple narratives of change, the paper's main purpose is to critically reflect on the potential of the recovery of the Japanese urban alleyway roji, arguing that the interstitial place of the roji can be characterised as a boundary between past and present (lifestyles), which is valuable space as it is desired and needed to express local voices, thoughts and personal opinions about urban change. In this sense, it continues to exist as imaginary, having a shared or social presence as mental space and an alternative landscape of reminiscence. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Alteration of pain recognition in schizophrenia								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN				17	9			1385	1392		10.1002/j.1532-2149.2013.00310.x			OCT 2013	2013	Background Schizophrenia patients display impaired recognition of their own emotions and those of others and deficits in several domains of empathy. The first-person experience of pain and observing others in pain normally trigger strong emotional mechanisms. We therefore hypothesized that schizophrenia patients would display impaired recognition and categorization of both their own pain and the pain of others.Methods We studied 29 patients (18 men/11 women; 36 +/- 13 years old) with paranoid schizophrenia-spectrum disorder and 27 healthy volunteers (20 men/7 women; 31 +/- 9 years old) matched for age, gender, IQ and socio-cultural level. We assessed symptom severity and theory of mind. The participants' ability to detect and categorize pain in others was assessed with the sensitivity to expressions of pain (STEP) test, which is based on facial expressions, and another dynamic test involving a series of video sequences showing various pain-inducing events. The ability of patients to evaluate their own pain was assessed with the situational pain questionnaire (SPQ), which includes a series of questions assessing how one would expect to feel in different imaginary situations. Empathic tendencies were assessed with the interpersonal reactivity index.Results Patients and controls differed significantly in STEP, pain video and SPQ scores. By contrast with control subjects, the patients' pain judgements were not correlated with their affective or cognitive empathic capacities.Conclusions Schizophrenic patients have a deficit of the identification and categorization of pain both in themselves and in others.									1	0	1	0	1	1090-3801		WOS:000323930700015	23529960

Although not widely acknowledged, Vygotsky (1999) also drew attention to the search for the relations between cognition and emotions. This paper discusses the findings of a study which examined imaginary scientific situations within the early years. The central research questions examined: What is the emotional nature of scientific learning? and How does affective imagination support early childhood science learning? Video observations were made of the teaching of science from one site in a south-eastern community in Australia (232 h of video observations). The teachers used fairy tales and Slowmation as cultural devices to support the concept formation of 3- and 4-year-old children (n = 53; range of 3.3 to 4.4; mean of 3.8 years). The findings of this under-researched area (e.g. Roth, Mind, Culture, and Activity 15:2-7, 2008) make a contribution to understanding how affective imagination can work in science education in the early years.									3	0	0	0	3	0157-244X		WOS:000324551800017

While the population-measurement capacities of the colonial governments of Western Australia and New Zealand were still weak, missionaries pioneered the gathering of the data that enabled humanitarians to objectify natives as populations. This paper focuses on Francis Dart Fenton (in New Zealand), Florence Nightingale (in Britain), and Rosendo Salvado (in Western Australia) in the 1850s and 1860s. Their belief in the necessity of population statistics manifests the practical convergence of colonial humanitarianism with public health perspectives and with "the statistical movement" that had become influential in Britain in the 1830s. We draw attention to the materialism and environmentalism of these three quantifiers of natives, and to how native peoples were represented as governable through knowledge of their physical needs and vulnerabilities.									0	0	0	0	0	0010-4175		WOS:000324761800007

However, there is a small population of Afro-Mexicans that reside primarily in Mexico's two coastal regions. So how do coastal Mexicans understand blackness? Using ethnographic and interview data, I show that while Mexico as a nation does not have systemic racial ideologies that incorporate blackness, distinct local ideas of blackness do exist within rural coastal Mexico, and are constructed, in part, through this national invisibility. Moreover, I argue that these local understandings are subject to transnational processes as Afro-Mexican immigration to the USA grows. The racial meanings produced among Afro-Mexican migrants in the USA circulate back to Mexico and reshape racial identities. This process highlights both the persisting role of race and mestizaje in constructing Mexican national identity.									0	0	0	0	0	0141-9870		WOS:000325389300006

Citizen-created photographs and videos that have become a routine feature of mainstream news coverage are approached as a potential force of change that transforms professional imaginaries of journalism vis-a-vis crisis events. From journalists' lines of thought three interpretative repertoires were identified: resistance, resignation and renewal. Our results hint at a rethinking of the professional norms and roles of journalists.									2	0	0	0	2	1464-8849		WOS:000325279500008

Doing this highlights a coalescing of sorts within the field; a movement the author describes as being less toward a specific theoretical framework as it is around a general way of doing agro-food scholarship. This style of scholarship embraces relationality, process, and multiplicity while emphasising the generative capacities of what agro-food scholars do for enacting novel political, ontological, and normative practices. The reminder of the article co-experiments with what it means to be open to these productive capacities as researchers, in terms of making the un-thought thinkable and un-doable routine. In doing this the article offers an account of agro-food imaginaries that is hopeful precisely because it is unsettling.									5	0	0	0	5	0038-0199		WOS:000325148600001		
J	Saviotti, Pier Paolo; Pyka, Andreas								From necessities to imaginary worlds: Structural change, product quality and economic development								TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE				80	8			1499	1512		10.1016/j.techfore.2013.05.002			OCT 2013	2013	In this paper we explore how innovation and structural change affected economic development in the long run, by which we mean a period such as the one between the industrial revolution and the present. We separate the period since the industrial revolution into two sub periods, which we call 'necessities' and 'imaginary worlds' and focus on three trajectories, increasing productive efficiency, increasing output variety, and increasing output quality and differentiation. In the paper we show how a combination of the three trajectories gave rise to the transition between 'necessities' and 'imaginary worlds' and propose a mechanism of economic development which could have given rise to the type of economic system which we can observe today. To create growing output quality and differentiation higher competencies were required. These higher competencies required higher levels of education and demanded higher wages, which contributed to raise consumers' purchasing power. These phenomena, combined with the income effect of the creation of new sectors, generated the disposable income with which consumers could purchase the new, higher quality, non necessities, goods and services generated by innovation. In the paper we study the impact of several model parameters on the stability of the virtuous circle previously described. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In 1983, Putnam and Benacerraf raised this objection against all conventionalist accounts of mathematics. I discuss the 1979 version and the scenario argument, which supports the key premise of the objection. The wide applicability of this objection is not apparent; I thus raise it against an imaginary axiomatic theory T similar to Peano arithmetic in all relevant aspects. I argue that a conventionalist can explain the consistency of T and suggest that an analogous explanation can be provided for the consistency of Peano arithmetic.									0	0	0	0	0	0031-8019		WOS:000325489400001

On the one hand, there has been a diminution in popular culture's imaginary engagement with forms of living otherwise, traceable through the shifting representation of what might constitute a good life' in British sitcoms during the second half of the twentieth century. Television comedies which dramatised opting out of middle-class normativity were gradually replaced by those centred around the familial unit as a buffer against disappointed attempts to forge a future differently. This increasingly conservative trend in popular culture is contrasted with an increasing radicality in the thinking about how we might live differently within the realms of theory, especially theorists who are indebted to and in dialogue with psychoanalysis. This is explored primary in the work of Leo Bersani and then through the introduction of each essay in this issue.									0	0	0	0	0	0950-236X		WOS:000325514600001

The rejection of condom use during anal sex, or barebacking', has in recent years been an important discursive site for theorising the tension between fantasy and reality. Debates about the degree to which barebacking is a real' sociological threat or simply a sensationalist narrative that reinforces the pathologisation of gay men has occurred alongside debates as to whether a lack of condoms (especially in pornography) signifies a woeful disregard for the realities of sexual life or the basis of a realist genre depicting more intense and authentic sexual interactions. Using a Lacanian framework for considering the subjective tension between experience and representation, I contend that those debates are limited to the same degree that they position fantasy and reality as discrete opposites. It is only where the language that substantiates the empirical and the subjective begins to break down that barebacking as a phenomenon can be said to exist at all.									0	0	0	0	0	0950-236X		WOS:000325514600006		
J	Chaudhuri, Una								Bug Bytes: Insects, Information, and Interspecies Theatricality								THEATRE JOURNAL				65	3			321	+					OCT 2013	2013	This essay uses an animal studies perspective to situate Tracy Letts's 1996 play Bug at a particularly fraught and complex moment in the long history of an "insect imaginary," which has variously registered and managed humans' intense ambivalence toward insects. The complexity includes a dawning recognition-alongside a reluctant admission-that insect species may not be as alien as we have traditionally styled them. In Bug, as in a variety of other recent insect representations, a revisioning of the insect imaginary is linked to a digitally inflected post-humanism in which decentered intelligence and distributed agency offer a welcome alternative to individualistic-self-centered-modes of political and artistic expression.									1	0	0	0	1	0192-2882		WOS:000325783900002

This ethnographic study of 45 death narratives by bereaved mothers collected from 1979-1989 in Pacatuba, Ceara, Brazil, refutes existing claims of mothers' selective neglect and indifference towards sick babies and emotionally empty grief response. I argue that through dead-baby dreamsand their imaginary transfigurationgrieving mothers alleviate infant death trauma. Feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, definitive loss, and personal guiltthe social seeds of depressionare reframed to deny death's finality and exonerate mothers from crippling self-blame. By transfiguring lingering mental images of the tiny cold corpse, mothers remold the irreversibility and definitiveness of death, gaining a sense of control over its unpredictable jolt. In the politically oppressive Northeast Brazilwhere social justice remains an illusionmothers dream to preserve their own mental sanity and to recover from death's cruel aftermath. Any interpretation of mourning behavior must be contextualized within the local moral world and its assumed structure of reality to avoid demoralizing grieving Brazilian mothers and compounding their suffering. You see, the only thing a poor woman truly owns that no one can borrow, cheat, steal or rob from her...is her imagination!

"There's a drumbeat in Africa": Embodying imaginary geographies of transnational whiteness in contemporary South Africa								GEOFORUM				49				1	9		10.1016/j.geoforum.2013.05.002			OCT 2013	2013	Emerging out of a study conducted in Durban of white, English-speaking South Africans (WESSAs) who had previously lived in the UK and elsewhere, this article argues that, because of South Africa's past and current liminal position within a global meta-geography of whiteness, "imaginative geographies" are centrally important to the construction of transnational WESSA identities. This article uses an expanded concept of imaginative geographies that encompasses not only discursive modes of representation but also the direct, embodied experiences of differential spaces on the part of transmigrants, as informants emphasised their understandings of the spaces in which white bodies were in and out of place. The most frequently deployed imaginative geographies were meta-geographies of "first world" and "third world," whilst South Africa was discussed as an African space of emotion, authenticity, and freedom and the UK a drab space of conformity, indignity, and discomfort. The data demonstrates that, for WESSA transnationals, South Africa and the UK emerge as geographies in relation to each other. Additionally, I argue that these unstable imaginative geographies offer potential routes to progressive means by which WESSAs can occupy the space of a democratic South Africa. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Monahan, Torin; Mokos, Jennifer T.								Crowdsourcing urban surveillance: The development of homeland security markets for environmental sensor networks								GEOFORUM				49				279	288		10.1016/j.geoforum.2013.02.001			OCT 2013	2013	Mobile systems for detecting environmental threats may radically restructure spatial imaginaries as people learn to see and engage with heretofore largely hidden dimensions of urban spaces. While the design of such technological systems is contingent and currently open to varied outcomes, powerful security and industry players are asserting their influence to set overriding protocols that will ensure widespread ambient data collection, especially for security and commercial applications. This paper critically explores the emergent power geographies of surveillance revealed by one such system: the Department of Homeland Security's Cell-All project. This project, which has been under development at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) since 2007, equips mobile phones with chemical-agent detectors and links them to security networks so that threats to urban populations can be automatically detected and rapidly mitigated. In order to assess the politics of crowdsourced sensing systems, first we map the core characteristics of the Cell-All development model: creating a participatory system, building public-private partnerships, and outsourcing responsibility for privacy protections. Second, we describe some alternative designs for mobile, participatory environmental sensing and reflect on their potentials for correcting power inequalities or achieving environmental justice. Finally, we conclude by discussing the implications of these various systems and the conditions that could alter their outcomes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The irregulars also profited from the regular practitioners' acceptance of ill-defined or imaginary male sexual disorders and the side effects of conventional venereal disease treatments, the lack of a clear demarcation between quacks and the regular medical profession, and an increased availability of newspaper advertising. Improvements in the postal system enabled quacks to reach more potential customers by mail, their preferred sales method. The decline in quackery resulted from scientific advances in the understanding of disease and government legislation to privilege regular practitioners and limit quacks' access to postal services and advertising.									0	0	0	0	0	0025-7273		WOS:000326139100004	24069916

Firstly, the idea of the psyche is proposed containing different co-existing modalities of representing emotional experience. One is a verbal inscription governed by the logic of the dynamically repressed, and another is the registration of a mode of being, in the form of sequences of psychic gestures that the subject exchanges with his objects. The author proposes that the psychic gesture is the ideo-pictographic representation for certain emotional states never verbally thought and, consequently, its metapsychological status is unconscious but not repressed. Secondly, these unconscious registers contain specific modalities of processing reality, created by the projective attribution of the parental unconscious. Finally, by conceiving this model of unconscious, ideo-pictographically represented as psychic gestures, the author proposes that a patient's emotional state, becoming a psychic gesture of the analytic pair, is enacted within the analytic stage. His proposal departs from the frequent view of enactment as a result of the non-represented aspects of the psyche. It is assumed that what is played out by the analytic pair pertains to the unconscious imaginary represented.									0	0	0	0	0	0020-7578		WOS:000325977500009	24102491

It explores representation of the Atlantic crossing alongside broader questions about the formation and mutation of group identity based on understandings and constructions of a shared past. Three textual examples, taken from the work of David Dabydeen, John Edgar Wideman, and Toni Morrison, are used to illustrate the agency, variety, and suggestiveness of this oceanic imaginary and to highlight some specific functions of literary media. Theories of collective and cultural memory help address concerns with memorialization; the recovery of forgotten histories; the role of cultural production; and counter, contextual, and shifting narratives of the past.									0	0	0	0	0	1750-6980		WOS:000325149900007

Building upon theories of monsters as cultural imaginaries, I argue that state and non-state actors evoke colonial-era constructions of difference to construct Joseph Kony, leader of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), as a monster to support contemporary geopolitical agendas. By troubling state-based definitions of security, this article disputes the idea that security practices predicated on the defeat of a monster translate into increased security for those most directly affected by the violence of the monster. Additionally, this article discusses alternative narratives circulating in northern Uganda that offer different readings of Kony's role in the cycles of violence that have ravaged the region. These narratives, when viewed through a feminist geopolitical lens, challenge the monster imaginary and, with it, the geopolitics of militarisation.									0	0	0	0	0	1465-0045		WOS:000327155100007

J	Pakis, Elisavet								Playing in the Dark: Staging Lesbian Blues, Questioning Gendered Belonging								JOURNAL OF MODERN GREEK STUDIES				31	2			217	247					OCT 2013	2013	In this article I discuss a collective theater performance called Lesbian Blues that took place in Athens, Greece in 1998. It was an experimental performance, directed by feminist director Christiana Lambrinidis. The piece was devised collaboratively with the women who took part in the project, through improvisation drawing on their lives, bodies, and writings. Drawing on Judith Butler's framework (1993, 1997), and on scenes from Lesbian Blues, I argue that this performance was staging a melancholic landscape in a (national) Greek imaginary, i.e., "workings of gender that do not 'show' in what is performed as gender" (Butler 1997:144). I examine how the women were writing and performing their queer selves, bodies, and desires, making rifts in the silence. I explore the atmosphere of embattlement, conflict, and the "blues" that informs the theatrical images. I argue that, drawing on their lives, bodies, and experiences, the women were questioning and contesting a Greek order of gendered belonging.									0	0	0	0	0	0738-1727		WOS:000327366300003

The article reflects on the musical instrument as a mediating element in the experiential process and on the pedagogical ideas developed by the "ecole nouvelle". The role of the teacher is of central importance for the relationship between subject and object. Finally, the musical instrument also possesses a symbolic and imaginary dimension which contributes substantially to the relationship between subject and object and subject and world.									0	0	0	0	0	1434-663X		WOS:000327462400006

The way we handle things sheds light on both individual and social realities which, in turn, are also reproduced in our manner of treating them. Kate Meyer-Drawe (Illusionen von Autonomie. Diesseits von Ohnmacht und Allmacht des Ich, 1990) therefore speaks of the person as a "sujet-subject". In the context of learning and teaching in school, things are closely related to "showing" as a form of action (Prange, Die Zeigestruktur der Erziehung: Grundriss der Operativen Padagogik, 2005). In addition to educational practices such as explaining something specific to a person or a group we also find showing in the sense of a "meaning-creating surplus" (Bohm Wie Bilder Sinn erzeugen - Die Macht des Zeigens, 2007). Nonverbal, material, imaginary and bodily realities are then placed alongside verbal-discursive realities. To demonstrate the many different forms of "showing" is relevant not only for the further development of the theory of educational approaches to learning, but also opens up empirical approaches to educational phenomena.									0	0	0	0	0	1434-663X		WOS:000327462400011		
J	Auxemery, Y.								The Gulf War Syndrome twenty years on								ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE				39	5			332	338		10.1016/j.encep.2012.11.003			OCT 2013	2013	Introduction. - After Operation Desert Storm which took place in Iraq from August 1990 to July 1991 involving a coalition of 35 countries and a 700,000 strong contingent of mainly American men, some associations of war veterans, the media and researchers described a new diagnostic the Gulf War Syndrome (GWS).Literature findings. - GWS seems to be a new disorder which associates a litany of functional integrating the musculoskeletal, digestive, tegumentary and neurosensory systems. symptoms presented do not allow a syndrome already known to be considered and the aetiology of the clinical picture remains unexplained, an increasing cause for concern resulting from the extent of the phenomenon and its media coverage. It quickly appears that there is no consensus amongst the scientific community concerning a nosographic description of GWS: can all these functional complaints arise from? Different aetiopathogenic hypotheses have been studied by the American administration who is attempting to incriminate exposure to multiple risks such as vaccines and their adjuvants, org 1-tophosphorous compounds, pyridostigmine (given to the troops for the preventive treatment of the former), impoverished uranium, and the toxic emanations from oil well fires. But despite extremely in-depth scientific investigations, 10 years after the end of the war, no objective marker of physical suffering has been retained to account for the disorders presented. It would appear that the former soldiers are in even better objective health than the civil population whereas their subjective level of health remains low. Within this symptomatic population, some authors have begun to notice that the psychological disorders appear and persist associating: asthenia, fatigability, mood decline, sleep disorders, cognitive disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Within the nosological framework, does GWS cause functional disorders or somatisation? Finally, 20 years after the end of the fighting, only PTSD has been causally attributed to military deployment.Clinical findings. Certain functional symptoms of GWS occur during the latent phase of a future reexperiencing syndrome, latent phase which is the locus of nonspecific symptoms. The psychotraumatised subject does not express himself spontaneously and waits to be invited to do so: if the social context does not allow this expression, the suffering can remain lodged in a few parts of the body. How can the inexpressible part of the trauma be recounted, particularly if the social context does not allow it? For civil society, calling into question "the somatic word" of veterans is difficult: why were they sent to face these hardships? What could we learn from these soldiers we do not wish to listen to: the horror of the war, the aggressive impulse of men, and the confrontation with death? Another obstacle to this reflection is the reference to stress as a prevalent aetiopathogenic model of the psychological trauma. A model like this, considering that PTSD is a normal reaction to an abnormal situation, finally discredits the subject and society and disempowers them by freezing them in a passive status of victim. Discussion. However, as GWS affects approximately a quarter of subjects deployed, it is not very likely that all these symptoms are caused by a psychotraumatic reaction. Many veterans suffering from GWS have themselves rejected the diagnosis of PTSD, arguing that they do not suffer repetition nightmares. What the veterans rightly tell us here is that the notions of stress and trauma cannot strictly be superimposed. A subject may have been intensely stressed without ever establishing traumatic flashbacks and likewise; a psychological trauma can be experienced without stress and without fear but in a moment of terror. This clarification is in line with the first criterion of the DSM-IV-TR which necessarily integrates the objective and subjective dimensions as determinants of PTSD. Yet, scientific studies relating to GWS are struggling to establish opposition or continuity links between the objective external exposure (smoke from petrol wells, impoverished uranium, biological agents, chemicals) and the share of inner emotion albeit reactive and characterised by a subjective stress. There were no lack of stress factors for the troops deployed: repeated alerts of chemical attacks, hostility of the environment with its sandstorms and venomous animals, climatic conditions making long hours of backup and static observation difficult, collecting bodies, lack of knowledge of the precise geography of their movements and uncertainty of the duration of the conflict. The military anti-nuclear bacteriological chemical uniform admittedly provided protective confinement, shutting out the hostile world from which the threat would come but, at the same time, this isolation increases the fear of a hypothetical risk whilst the internal perceptions are increased and can open the way to future somatisations. In a context like this, the somatic manifestations of anxiety (palpitations, sweating, paresthesia...) are willingly associated with somatised functional disorders to which can also be assigned over-interpretations of bodily feelings according to a hypochondriacal mechanism. The selective attention to somatic perceptions in the absence of mentalisations, the request for reassurance reiterated and the excessive use of the treatment system will be diagnostic indices of these symptoms caused by the stress.Rather than toxic exposure to such and such a substance, the non-specific syndrome called "Gulf War Syndrome" is the result of exposure to the eponymous operational theatre. But if the psychological and psychosomatic suffering occurring in veterans is immutable throughout history, the expression of these difficulties has specificities according to the past cultural, political and scientific context. In the example of GWS, the diffusion of the fear of a pathology resulting from chemical weapons has promoted this phenomenon. In the end, biochemical and biological weapons have not been used on a large scale but the mediatisation of this possibility has led to a deleterious... To spare the bother of a group psychological reflection, the scientific and political authorities chose to investigate the implication of environmental factors in the genesis of the disorder. At individual as well as social level, rather than accept a psychogenic origin, a common defence mechanism is to assign the suffering to an external cause. With the perspective of preventing the risk of diffusion of other unexplained syndromes, which could occur following future armed conflicts, new epidemiological diagnostic models must be defined. The media also has considerable responsibility for the diffusion of epidemic psychological reactions but at the same time, they can inform the population about certain individual or group psychopathological mechanisms.Conclusion. - The GWS exists: it is not an "imaginary illness" but a serious public health issue which has led to tens of thousands of complaints and swallowed up millions of dollars. To reply to human suffering, a new nosographic entity can spread through society taking the epidemic expression of a somatised disorder via identification, imitation and suggestion mechanisms. This possibility questions not only mental health but also the sociology and politics. It is necessary to inform the leaders and the general population of the possibility of this type of mass reaction, which can take the shape of a highly contagious complex functional syndrome.

The domain of instruction was the electricity domain of high-pass and low-pass filters. Participants were students from a technical vocational school. In the experimental condition (N = 21) students created assignments for an imaginary student to help this student to learn from a computer simulation. The LOOK-EXPERIMENT-DESIGN (LED) approach was developed to support students in designing these assignments. This support structure scaffolded students in orienting themselves in the simulation (LOOK), in performing experiments to gain more insight into the simulated domain (EXPERIMENT), and in designing assignments (DESIGN) about the simulated domain. Students in the control condition (N = 28) received traditional instruction. Students came from two different classes and were divided over the two conditions. After 3 two-hour lessons, all students completed a test measuring conceptual and procedural knowledge. Results showed that, in one class, students who learned by designing assignments performed significantly better on test items measuring conceptual knowledge than students who learned from traditional instruction. This was not replicated in the other class. No differences between the conditions were found for procedural knowledge.									0	0	0	0	0	1436-4522		WOS:000327764400004		
J	Little, Adrian; Macdonald, Kate								Pathways to global democracy? Escaping the statist imaginary								REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES				39	4			789	813		10.1017/S0260210512000551			OCT 2013	2013	Critics of global democracy have often claimed that the social and political conditions necessary for democracy to function are not met at the global level, and are unlikely to be in the foreseeable future. Such claims are usually developed with reference to national democratic institutions, and the social conditions within national democratic societies that have proved important in sustaining them. Although advocates of global democracy have contested such sceptical conclusions, they have tended to accept the method of reasoning from national to global contexts on which they are based. This article critiques this method of argument, showing that it is both highly idealised in its characterisation of national democratic practice, and overly state-centric in its assumptions about possible institutional forms that global democracy might take. We suggest that if aspiring global democrats - and their critics - are to derive useful lessons from social struggles to create and sustain democracy within nation states, a less idealised and institutionally prescriptive approach to drawing global lessons from national experience is required. We illustrate one possible such approach with reference to cases from both national and global levels, in which imperfect yet meaningful democratic practices have survived under highly inhospitable - and widely varying - conditions.									1	0	0	0	1	0260-2105		WOS:000330356300001

In our article we focus on the relation between science and fishing, examining the vision of scientists and their conflict-ridden dealings with traditional fishermen. This was not a fruitful relationship, and it ended with scientists requesting the delegitimization of fishermen as producers, receivers and encoders of knowledge.									0	0	0	0	0	0104-5970		WOS:000330613100011	24473655

It begins by highlighting the contributions of JoAo Vargas' scholarship to the understanding of the imminently racial character of lethal state violence in Brazil, around practices of police killings of black youth justified as acts of resistance, the media's visualization of danger in favelas as a militarized state of emergency, and housing practices that continue to segregate race and concentrate poverty. Generating new analyses that trace extensions or dis-locations, since 2013, of some of the practices described by Vargas, this article examines (1) the shift from bandido (drug gang member) to vandalo (racialized rioter/looter) as enemy number one of the police, (2) the rise of the Black Bloc as target of state security discourse haunted by imaginaries of African diasporic radicalism as well as youth anarchy, and (3) new public mobilizations around and against the public morality and shock of order campaigns launched against black delinquency and prostitution in consumer spaces.									0	0	0	0	0	1099-9949		WOS:000333870900003

As a female researcher, the feminist ethnographic perspective allows me to identify, describe, analyze and interpret the ways in witch gender relations are produced and reproduced in a school setting. In this presentation I focus on one part of the evidences and arguments built throughout the field work, that recognizes as a main source the "official" school documentation and the execution of focus groups with early childhood students. The work made thus far, allows corroborating the importance of continuing with the deep study of the links between the school "inside" and "outside", a central way for the interpretation of the roles and the construction of the imaginaries differentiated by sexes.

While extant evidence has detailed consequences that ensue from the utilization of these distinct points of view, less is known about their more basic properties. Here, we investigated the prevalence, demographics and qualities associated with the visual perspective that people spontaneously adopt when the mind wanders. The results from a cross-cultural survey (N = 400) revealed that almost half of the participants (46%) typically utilize a third-person perspective when mind wandering. Further, culture and gender were shown to impact the distribution of first- and third-person imagers. Specifically, a first-person perspective was more common among participants from Western nations and females, while participants from Eastern cultures resonated more strongly with a third-person perspective. Moreover, these factors were also shown to impact qualities (e.g., temporal locus, vividness) of mental imagery. Taken together, the current findings elucidate the prevalence of first- and third-person visual perspectives and detail individual differences that influence the qualia of mind wandering.									0	0	0	0	0	1664-1078		WOS:000331238100001	24130538

The present study investigated LFP recorded bilaterally from the STN at wakeful rest in ten patients with PD after overnight withdrawal of levodopa (OFF) and after a single dose levodopa administration (ON). We utilized connectivity measures being insensitive to volume conduction (functional connectivity: non-zero imaginary part of coherency; effective connectivity: phase-slope index). We demonstrated the presence of neuronal interactions in the frequency range of 10-30 Hz in STN-LFP without a preferential directionality of interactions between different contacts along the electrode tracks. While the direction of neuronal interactions per se was preserved after levodopa administration, functional connectivity and the ventral-dorsal information flow were modulated by medication. The OFF-ON differences in functional connectivity were correlated with the levodopa-induced improvement in clinical Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores. We hypothesize that regional neuronal interactions, as reflected in STN-LFP connectivity, might represent a basis for the intra-nuclear spatial specificity of deep brain stimulation. Moreover, our results suggest the potential use of volume conduction-insensitive measures of connectivity in STN-LFP as a marker of clinical motor symptoms in PD. (c) 2013 IBRO.

We perform BSS in the modulation domain to take advantage of the improved signal sparsity and reduced musical tone noise in this domain over the conventional acoustic frequency domain processing. We first use modulation domain real and imaginary spectral subtraction (MRISS) to enhance both magnitude and phase spectra of the noisy speech mixture inputs. We then estimate the direction of arrivals (DOAs) of the speech sources from subband inter-sensor phase differences (IPDs) by using an asymmetric Laplacian mixture model (ALMM), cluster the full-band IPDs via the estimated DOAs, and perform time frequency masking to separate the source signals, all in the modulation domain. Experimental evaluations in five types of noises have shown that the performance of the proposed method is robust in 0-10 dB SNRs and it is superior to acoustic domain separation without MRISS.

A great array of kings of Rum occurs in many Malay literary genres in which his protean image emerges as king-sage, just king, or tyrant. However fantastical adventure tales and historical or quasi-historical chronicles are his favourite habitats'. In the former genre, Raja Rum appears in the fanciful world of heavenly and demonic creatures that populate various never-never lands in some of which allusions to the Ottoman empire can be discerned. A different, although no less imaginary, Raja Rum appears in works of the latter genre. This is Iskandar Zulkarnain (Alexander the Great), first a Persian and later a Turkish king, the greatest ever monarch of East and West and the preacher of the primordial Islam of the prophet Ibrahim (Abraham). Represented as the progenitor of local dynasties, this stranger-king' dominates the world of political mythology in chronicles of many peoples of the Malay Archipelago. He and his descendents create the dynastic space' in which Malay dynasties are linked to each other and with lineages of the great powers of the external world. On the basis of Sejarah Melayu (Malay Annals) and Tambo Minangkabau (Minangkabau traditions) the article examines this mandala-like dynastic space which, inter alia, shows an interaction between the political mythologies of these two works.									0	0	0	0	0	1363-9811		WOS:000324670900005

We modelled expected spatio-temporal trajectories of land management of a mountain grassland landscape in the French Alps under a range of short-term climate and socio-economic scenarios which were constructed using an advanced participatory approach with a variety of stakeholders. First, regional experts from nature conservation and agricultural extension were involved in the co-development of detailed qualitative climate and socioeconomic scenarios, expressed as coherent storylines. Second, to map land management adaptation to these storylines, we used a role playing game whereby farmers were put in an imaginary future situation and asked to make decisions under scenario constraints. For each scenario, game outcomes were used to map future land management at parcels to landscape scales. Main adaptations were conversion from mowing to grazing and increasing manured area, with varying proportions and locations for these two types of changes differing across scenarios, though overall small. These results highlight the limited adaptability of current farmers given a strongly constraining natural and social context. Beyond research outputs, this framework generated interesting outcomes for stakeholders and raised their awareness about the socio-ecological system's vulnerability to future changes.

Based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in two airports - of departure and arrival of this migratory route - I look at the practices of sending and receiving objects by migrants in Lisbon and their kin in Bissau. The transnational yet grounded setting helps to provide a better understanding of the complexity associated with different forms of mobility - including corporeal, imagined and desired - and their key role in socially and relationally constructing a lived airport space, as well as wider social landscapes. Bringing in evidence from a less-explored setting - a small airport in a West African country - will particularly challenge some of the assumptions that tend to associate mobility with modernity' and fixity with tradition'. It will show how people in Guinea-Bissau are, as much as migrants abroad, dynamically involved in global practices of movement - materialised in trading and reciprocating objects between two continents - through local performances of mobility that do not necessarily involve corporeal travel across borders.									1	0	0	0	1	1745-0101		WOS:000324978500004		
J	Hashimoto, Yasunari; Ushiba, Junichi								EEG-based classification of imaginary left and right foot movements using beta rebound								CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY				124	11			2153	2160		10.1016/j.clinph.2013.05.006			NOV 2013	2013	Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate cortical lateralization of event-related (de) synchronization during left and right foot motor imagery tasks and to determine classification accuracy of the two imaginary movements in a brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm.Methods: We recorded 31-channel scalp electroencephalograms (EEGs) from nine healthy subjects during brisk imagery tasks of left and right foot movements. EEG was analyzed with time-frequency maps and topographies, and the accuracy rate of classification between left and right foot movements was calculated.Results: Beta rebound at the end of imagination (increase of EEG beta rhythm amplitude) was identified from the two EEGs derived from the right-shift and left-shift bipolar pairs at the vertex. This process enabled discrimination between right or left foot imagery at a high accuracy rate (maximum 81.6% in single trial analysis).Conclusion: These data suggest that foot motor imagery has potential to elicit left-right differences in EEG, while BCI using the unilateral foot imagery can achieve high classification accuracy, similar to ordinary BCI, based on hand motor imagery.Significance: By combining conventional discrimination techniques, the left-right discrimination of unilateral foot motor imagery provides a novel BCI system that could control a foot neuroprosthesis or a robotic foot.

J	McSherry, A.								Jacques Lacan's theory of the subject as real, symbolic and imaginary: how can Lacanian theory be of help to mental health nursing practice?								JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC AND MENTAL HEALTH NURSING				20	9			776	781		10.1111/jpm.12011			NOV 2013	2013	This paper presents an outline of Lacan's theory of the human subject, in particular focusing on Lacan's concepts of the real, symbolic and imaginary registers, and how an understanding of these can inform change and practice in mental health nursing. Mental health nursing is under pressure to define itself as a practice distinct from other professions in the field, and to respond in new ways to promoting mental health to the individual and a wider public. Lacan's theory of the subject is of particular relevance to mental health nurses working with mental distress but has received little attention in mental health nursing literature. Six implications for practice are outlined in terms of: against normalization, the importance of the function of the symptom, what cannot be known, meaning as ever-changing, against empathy and against holistic ideas of the self.									0	0	0	0	0	1351-0126		WOS:000325371100003	23145967	
J	Irni, Sari								The politics of materiality: Affective encounters in a transdisciplinary debate								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES				20	4			347	360		10.1177/1350506812472669			NOV 2013	2013	This article analyses the discussion about the new materialism' or material feminisms' as an interplay between transdisciplinarity - moving beyond canons and disciplines (Lykke, 2004) - and affective interdisciplinary encounters. The previous discussion (e.g. Ahmed, 2008; Barad, 2003; Hemmings, 2011; Sullivan, 2012) is taken in a slightly different direction, by arguing that a politics of materiality is at work in the debate, which is implied in affective interdisciplinary encounters. It is argued that despite the transdisciplinarity, the relations of natural science engagements to both social science and humanities feminisms are pivotal. Two specific cases are analysed: the politics of definition, where materiality' tends to be equated with natural science matters', and the matter and politics of race. In the latter, race sticks' to the materiality of materialist feminism (cf. Hemmings, 2011), which tends to be left out of the sphere of the presumably new and exciting material feminisms.									0	0	0	0	0	1350-5068		WOS:000325969900003

Controlling for socioeconomic status, receptive verbal ability, total number of utterances, and duration of observation, there was a main effect of imaginary companion status on type of private speech. Children who had imaginary companions were more likely to engage in covert private speech compared with their peers who did not have imaginary companions. These results suggest that the private speech of children with imaginary companions is more internalized than that of their peers who do not have imaginary companions and that social engagement with imaginary beings may fulfill a similar role to social engagement with real-life partners in the developmental progression of private speech.

This article reports on a qualitative study carried out in the UK investigating British children's perceptions of their imaginary companions. Eight children aged between 5 and 11 years were interviewed. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to explore individual and cross-case themes. It was found that imaginary companions provided friendship, playmates and entertainment, enabling children to overcome times of boredom and loneliness. They appeared to provide a level of wish fulfilment for some children. Children's interactions with their imaginary companions provided support when there were problem situations in the children's lives.									0	0	0	0	0	0907-5682		WOS:000326651600011		
J	Gallchoir, Cliona O.								Modernity, Gender, and the Nation in Joseph O'Connor's Star of the Sea								IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW				43	2			344	362		10.3366/iur.2013.0084			NOV 2013	2013	The late 1990s and early 2000s were marked by the appearance of a number of ambitious historical novels by Irish writers, including Joseph O'Connor's Star of the Sea (2004), which enjoyed both critical and commercial success internationally as well as in Ireland. The turn towards historical fiction occurred as Ireland experienced an unprecedented economic boom accompanied by rapid social change during the period now notoriously referred to as the Celtic Tiger. The concern with Ireland's belated entry into modernity that was a hallmark of the Celtic Tiger period is reflected in Star of the Sea, in which, this essay argues, there is an attempt to construct a national subject position fully compatible with modernity. To this end, for instance, the Irish language is represented in the novel as a standardized, written language, so that the voiceless victims of the Famine, many of whom were Irish-speaking and illiterate, can be reclaimed for twenty-first-century Ireland. O'Connor is however concerned as much with authenticity as he is with modernity, and through the figure of Mary Duane the novel thus ultimately reinstates the silence and wordlessness that is a hallmark of the Famine in the Irish national imaginary.									0	0	0	0	0	0021-1427		WOS:000326387900008

By paying close attention to the language deployed during a series of contentious city council meetings, the author traces how Zephyrhills's divisive history and neoliberal spatial order kept white residents from grappling with the city's legacy of racism, inequality, residential segregation, and memory of the Civil Rights movement. Ultimately, it reveals Americans' limited capacity to recognize and discuss race in the post-Civil Rights era.									0	0	0	0	0	0096-1442		WOS:000325473700004		
J	Blatterer, Harry								Friendship's freedom and gendered limits								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL THEORY				16	4			435	456		10.1177/1368431013484000			NOV 2013	2013	This article elaborates the interactional freedom of friendship and its limits. It shows that friendship is marked by a normative freedom that makes it relatively resistant to reification, especially when compared to erotic love. It argues further, however, that due to friendship's embeddedness in the contemporary gender order, this freedom is limited. Having first outlined the freedom hypothesis, the article goes on to argue that friendship's normative freedom is made possible by its weak institutional connectivity'. To clarify that point, the article illustrates friendship's resistance to the reifying tendencies of therapy culture and then draws the gendered boundary of friendship's freedom with reference to the position of heterosexual cross-sex friendship in the heteronormative social imaginary. The article concludes by way of argument for a differentiated approach to friendship and suggests that the analysis of its freedom provides significant clues concerning the work that remains to be done towards equal gender relations.									0	0	0	0	0	1368-4310		WOS:000326964200003		
J	Burns, Jennifer								Lupus in Fabula: The Workings of Fear in Italian Migration Narratives								ITALIAN STUDIES				68	3			429	448		10.1179/0075163413Z.00000000052			NOV 2013	2013	This article analyses the expression of fear within the novel I lupi della notte by Amor Dekhis, and with reference to other narratives written by migrant writers in Italian, tracing not only the outcomes of fear but also its origins and operations in the stories told. In so doing, it attempts to articulate how an imaginary of fear which finds its expression in individual stories, often deploying the tropes of fable, is also indicated and begs interpretation as a shared emotion or even a collective condition. Drawing upon discussions of the production and circulation of fear by Sara Ahmed, as well as Freud's exploration of the uncanny, the article posits a fluid and multilateral interaction of fear and threat. This, in turn, indicates ways of understanding through transnational narratives a more widespread, even globalized, condition of fear in late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century culture.									0	0	0	0	0	0075-1634		WOS:000327017000007		
J	Shales, Ezra								Mass Production as an Academic Imaginary (or, if more must be said of Marcel, "Evacuating Duchampian Conjecture in the Age of Recursive Scholarship")								JOURNAL OF MODERN CRAFT				6	3			267	274		10.2752/174967813X13806265666654			NOV 2013	2013	As a response to John Roberts' article in this issue ("Temporality, Critique, and the Vessel Tradition"), this essay argues against his description of toilet or urinal manufacture as "postartisanal." Sanitaryware is still made by living people who manually rig up heavy plaster molds piece by piece, pour liquid slip, and athletically finish them with scrapers and sponges. Roberts' sighting of a "crisis of artisanal labor in the alienated form of factory handcraft" is an ahistorical narrative that, having issued forth from the keenly poetic pens of John Ruskin and Karl Marx, lives on in contemporary academic jeremiads (for example, Richard Sennett and Howard Risatti). This essay builds on scholars who argue for nuanced examinations of the histories of skilled production and mechanization that are material-specific (such as Isobel Armstrong, Peter Dormer, and Michael Ettema on glass, textiles, and wood, respectively). It proposes that there is greater value in researching the marginalized voices and unexamined perspectives of the shop floor than in continuing to wrangle over circumscribed gene pools of artistic genius or invented genres such as "the vessel."									0	0	0	0	0	1749-6772		WOS:000326856700003

J	Romeo, Bruno; Choucha, Walid; Hanon, Cecile								Actuality of paraphrenia and link with affectives disorders								ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES				171	9			645	649		10.1016/j.amp.2013.08.009			NOV 2013	2013	Objectives. - From a clinical observation, firstly we will discuss the clinical value of such diagnosis of paraphrenia. Secondly, we will describe possible associations between paraphrenia and affective disorder. Observation. - We present the clinical observation of M. B., 42 years, hospitalized in psychiatric department against his will for behavioral troubles and delusional ideas. He previously suffered twice from depression that needed hospitalizations (in 1995 and 2010). After the last hospitalization, a treatment by escitalopram was prescribed but the patient didn't follow this treatment. When he was rehospitalised, he showed a psychomotor excitation, a depressive mood and insomnia without fatigue. He also had systematized delusions centered on his family, with imagination and interpretation mechanisms and megalomania and persecution thematics. The patient was not desorganised. A treatment by risperidone and valproic acid was prescribed and resulted in a good regression of the different symptoms within two months. Discussion. - If we apply the international classification like the ICM 10, this patient could be diagnosed: "persistent delirium and bipolar disorder". But if we apply other criteriae such as those of Ravidran and al., M. B. could be considered as presenting a paraphrenia. If we consider the euphoria and the psychomotor excitation as being a part of confabulatory paraphrenia, the affective disorder could be considered as a recurrent depressive disorder rather than a bipolar disorder. Thus, this clinical observation may link paraphrenia to affectives disorders and this link could be supported by four hypotheses. First, paraphrenia can be an affective disorder. Two observations support this hypothesis: the cyclic evolution and some symptoms, like the psychomotrice excitation, which are common between paraphrenia and mania. Second, paraphrenia may be considered as a kind of evolution of affectives disorders as a delusional reconstruction scarring. Nodet even described the paraphrenia post-mania and the paraphrenia post-depression. Third, patient with a paraphrenia may be more prone to develop an affective disorder and the delusional disorder mixing reality and imaginary elements may result in difficulties for the adaptation to environmental stress. Fourth, same risks factors such as genetic or epigenetic factors, emotional deprivation and/or social isolation are common to paraphrenia and affective disorder. However, paraphrenia is frequently associated with cluster A personality disorder (paranoiac and schizoid) while affective disorder are more linked to cluster B personality disorder (borderline). Conclusion. The efficacy of a treatment combining neuroleptic and mood stabilizers and the preservation of social insertion are important and indicate a therapeutic strategy that is different from schizophrenia. Thus, the determination of a link betWeen paraphrenia and affective disorders could allow better therapeutic strategy and better follow-up on the long run. (c) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Whether it takes orders from the republic or the monarchy, the ominous presence of the gruesome instrument overshadows the novels in which the main characters eventually accept and even choose to offer their heads to the implacable blade. The figure of the guillotine is apprehended through two prisms: its serial and sacred qualities, i. e. by considering how each novelist constructs the symbolism of the 'widow' by including or excluding its technical side and/or building a rhetoric of the divine ('Sainte Guillotine'). The bleak ceremonial of the head-cutting machine, under the pen of these authors, becomes an emblem of cruelty and ignominy but also of resistance and sublimity.									0	0	0	0	0	1478-7318		WOS:000327873100004

Humanitas refers to ethical and juridical notions of equality, autonomy and freedom. Much less understood is the meaning of dignitas, which this paper develops as peoples' engagement with aesthetic values and genres, and hence with differences between people. Departing from a critical reading of Georgio Agamben's notion of 'bare life', I will analyze a case where aesthetics are quite literally at stake: women who lost their hair due to cancer treatment. The analysis shows a complicated interplay between varying evaluations of female baldness by the self and others, mediated by (often strongly negative) cultural imaginaries, and aesthetic genres depicting conventional ways of 'looking good'. The paper concludes by arguing for a reconnection of the two notions of dignity, and for a rehabilitation of aesthetics in daily life and care as fundamental values for organizing our societies.									0	0	0	0	0	1386-7423		WOS:000327128500038	23604640

It examines the role of (trans-)national forces in constructing BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) as drivers for recovery. First, it comments on some cultural economy' studies and indicates the value of a CPE approach. Second, it examines the BRIC' as a symbolic condensation of hope' knowledge and shows how this signifier evolved in three overlapping moments referring to its role as investor, consumer and lender. Third, it considers the material basis of the appeal of BRIC discourses, especially the credibility acquired through BRIC stimulus packages in the global financial crisis. Fourth, it indicates how China's gold standard' stimulus package has intensified some deep-rooted political tensions and harmed subaltern groups. Finally, it reflects on how CPE can contribute to studies of crisis and recovery.									0	0	0	0	0	0308-5147		WOS:000327475700002

It brings together two usually separate domains of inquiry to reconsider geopolitical, emotional, and intellectual crosscurrents of these ostensibly national controversies in parts of the EU. I argue that these two domains need addressing in tandem to generate new insights and move scholarly debates that have become polarized in turn. The first strand is critiques of the influence that popular culture, in particular reality television makeover shows, has on body image and global consumption practices. The second is postcolonial critiques of orientalist discourses around the agency of Muslim women and veil dressing practices. The aim is to unpack the underlying contradictions and blind-spots that characterize many of the arguments for and against these laws, used by critics of not only Burqa-Ban legislation but also Muslim women's veil dressing in a context in which western public imaginaries about what the veil really means are becoming increasingly polarized and punitive. This juxtaposition can provide a new theoretical and empirical point of departure for reflecting on the geopolitical and ethical implications of laws that aim to police women's bodies and ways of dressing in western liberal democracies; an hardening of attitude and political discourse that lies at the intersection of global shifts in post 9/11 popular imaginaries, national identity projects, and geopolitics.									0	0	0	0	0	1528-3577		WOS:000330178700002

Despite removing traditional barriers of cultural capital, however, these exhibitions now presume a level of technological and performative competence, which can feel equally intimidating to visitors. Reporting on an UK-based ethnographic study and using dramaturgical theory, we show how interactive exhibitions can evoke situational shyness in visitors, through the combination of a demand for active, performative engagement and the deliberate restriction of instructional and explanatory information. In this ambiguous setting, visitors search for a social script to guide their action, the absence or opaqueness of which creates self-conscious inhibition. Actors adapt to this resourcefully by looking toward others to provide a replacement script; these may be companion visitors, strangers, or imaginary audiences. Some visitors, meanwhile, demonstrate resistance by refusing to engage with the interactive art agenda altogether, preferring to assume a role of detached spectatorship.									0	0	0	0	0	0195-6086		WOS:000330130900003

It argues that the process by which the idea of the 'martyr' was secularised and politicised was actually initiated by religious agents themselves. The analysis considers how commemoration initiatives devised by religious agents, social movements and political actors have brought 'Catholic martyrs' into the pantheon of national symbols. It also deals with the various semantic shifts seen in the public discourses of religious agents themselves, shifts that extend the boundaries of an eminently religious category by associating it with other figures in a more specifically political imaginary, such as that of the hero and the victim. The article shows how the political power of the religious figure of the martyr lay in the way various actors could use it to invoke the image of a legitimate and heroic victim of political violence. It thus allowed those actors to sidestep the vexed public question of whether those being commemorated had had any involvement in armed struggle.									0	0	0	0	0	0022-216X		WOS:000330466800003

The memory of this war survived in the Spanish collective imaginary even long after the end of the conflict, when Flanders was an ally of the Spanish Crown against France. When Chile becomes the great military problem due to native resistance to conquest, the idea of a second Flanders will turn up in America. This article tries to show the process and context sin which Flanders becomes visible in the discourse elaborated around the kingdom of Chile in the chronicles of 16th and 17th Centuries, until Diego de Rosales, the first writer to use the term "IndianFlanders".

Electrocortical activity associated with subjective communication with the deceased								FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				4						834	10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00834			NOV 20 2013	2013	During advanced meditative practices, unusual perceptions can arise including the sense of receiving information about unknown people who are deceased. As with meditation, this mental state of communication with the deceased involves calming mental chatter and becoming receptive to subtle feelings and sensations. Psychometric and brain electrophysiology data were collected from six individuals who had previously reported accurate information about deceased individuals under double-blind conditions. Each experimental participant performed two tasks with eyes closed. In the first task, the participant was given only the first name of a deceased person and asked 25 questions. After each question, the participant was asked to silently perceive information relevant to the question for 20s and then respond verbally. Responses were transcribed and then scored for accuracy by individuals who knew the deceased persons. Of the four mediums whose accuracy could be evaluated, three scored significantly above chance (p < 0.03). The correlation between accuracy and brain activity during the 20s of silent mediumship communication was significant in frontal theta for one participant (p < 0.01). In the second task, participants were asked to experience four mental states for 1 min each: (1) thinking about a known living person, (2) listening to a biography, (3) thinking about an imaginary person, and (4) interacting mentally with a known deceased person. Each mental state was repeated three times. Statistically significant differences at p < 0.01 after correction for multiple comparisons in electrocortical activity among the four conditions were obtained in all six participants, primarily in the gamma band (which might be due to muscular activity). These differences suggest that the impression of communicating with the deceased may be a distinct mental state distinct from ordinary thinking or imagination.									0	0	0	0	0	1664-1078		WOS:000331248100001	24312063	
J	Oreskes, Naomi; Conway, Erik M.								The Collapse of Western Civilization: A View from the Future								DAEDALUS				142	1			40	58					WIN 2013	2013	Science fiction writers construct an imaginary future; historians attempt to reconstruct the past. Ultimately, both are seeking to understand the present. In this essay, we blend the two genres to imagine a future historian looking back on a past that is our present and (possible) future. The occasion is the tercentenary of the end of Western culture (1540 - 2073); the dilemma being addressed is how we - the children of the Enlightenment - failed to act on robust information about climate change and knowledge of the damaging events that were about to unfold. Our historian concludes that a second Dark Age had fallen on Western civilization, in which denial and self-deception, rooted in an ideological fixation on "free" markets, disabled the world's powerful nations in the face of tragedy. Moreover, the scientists who best understood the problem were hamstrung by their own cultural practices, which demanded an excessively stringent standard for accepting claims of any kind - even those involving imminent threats. Here, our future historian, living in the Second People's Republic of China, recounts the events of the Period of the Penumbra (1988 - 2073) that led to the Great Collapse and Mass Migration (2074).									6	0	2	0	6	0011-5266		WOS:000313760800004		
J	Epurescu-Pascovici, Ionut								Le Chemin de Povrete et de Richesse and the Late Medieval Social Imaginary								FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES				36	1			19	50		10.1215/00161071-1816473			WIN 2013	2013	Authored by a modest legal professional, Le chemin de povrete et de richesse offers a remarkable entry point into the late medieval social imaginary, bringing into focus the views of the urban laity. Responding to socioeconomic instability, the author articulates a model of conduct that relies on pragmatic rationality (personified by Raison [Reason]), work, and self-discipline for the attainment of a moderate but secure social standing. While religious ethics remain important, socioeconomic factors are treated in their own right. Reflecting a complex social imaginary, the text offers a moment of genuine dialogism when maistre Barat (Deceit), the personification of the arrivistes who rely on fraud and sycophancy, defends his own path to success. The chastel de Labour, populated not by knights but by "more than a hundred thousand laborers," subverts the hierarchy of the traditional imaginary of the three orders. This article relates the changes in the social imaginary to the beginnings of European modernity.									0	0	0	0	0	0016-1071		WOS:000316243100002

There is no agreement on whether working memory declines equally for visuospatial and verbal information, and the literature disagrees on how task difficulty may influence this decay. We addressed these questions in a lifespan sample of 1,500 participants between 21 and 80 years old. The n-back task was used, with letters and circles presented at different positions around an imaginary circle, to evaluate working memory in the verbal and visuospatial domains, respectively. The participants' task was to judge whether the current stimulus matched a stimulus that was shown n trials prior. Both domains were evaluated in two levels of difficulty: 1-back and 2-back. The comparison across decades showed that discrimination in the visuospatial and 1-back tasks started to decline earlier in women than in men; however, discrimination was equal between the sexes in the verbal and 2-back tasks. Performance on tasks in the visuospatial domain exhibited more pronounced decline than in those in the verbal domain. The rate of decline in working memory accuracy was superior in 2-back tasks than in 1-back tasks, independent of the domain. These results revealed that the effects of aging on working memory are less dependent on the type of information and more reliant on the resources demanded by the task.									2	0	1	0	2	0161-9152		WOS:000326100600021	23558670	
J	Clarke, Matthew; Moore, Alex								Professional standards, teacher identities and an ethics of singularity								CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF EDUCATION				43	4			487	500		10.1080/0305764X.2013.819070			DEC 1 2013	2013	This paper offers a critical analysis of the education policy move towards teacher professional standards. Drawing on Lacan's three registers of the psyche (real, imaginary and symbolic), the paper argues that moves towards codification (and domestication) of teachers' work and identities in standardized (and sanitized) forms, such as the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership professional standards recently adopted in Australia, can be read as a colonization of the Real and the imaginary by (a rather static, mortified form of) the symbolic. The paper argues that in response to such normalizing moves, we need to consider how we might conceptualize the reanimation of what it means to teach and be a teacher, something we attempt in terms of enabling each of the psyche's registers to inter-animate each other, as a means of engendering teacher identities characterized by criticality, creativity and passion - that is, by an ethics of singularity rather than by standardization.									1	0	0	0	1	0305-764X		WOS:000325810100005

What methodology could be used to discuss nomadic qualities of learning mobilities? This article argues in favor of an arts-based research approach, specifically social cartography, as a tool that can encourage young people to reflect on their identity as learners. Attentive to the deterritorializations, transgressions, and disruptions that characterize the learning process, it develops a mobile strategy for following the learner. This argument engages the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari to explore a pedagogical framework that expands our social imaginary of learning.									0	0	0	0	0	1077-8004		WOS:000326012200005

It takes the reader on a journey around an English multicultural primary school supported by the creative learning program Creative Partnerships, exploring how creative arts practices (re)configured sociospatial relations within the school community over a 3-year period. The article proposes the metaphor of capaciousness to illuminate aspects of research and practice in schools concerning space, learning, and the significance of the connections of schools to other spaces, places, and networks. Recognizing these connections enables us to take account of issues of social justice particularly in relation to schools located in areas of socioeconomic deprivation. A spatial theorization of ethos also questions the concept of boundaries in case study research, and highlights the role of researcher interpretation in constituting what can be recognized as creative school ethos.									0	0	0	0	0	1077-8004		WOS:000326012200008		
J	Ladwig, Patrice								Haunting the State: Rumours, Spectral Apparitions and the Longing for Buddhist Charisma in Laos								ASIAN STUDIES REVIEW				37	4			509	526		10.1080/10357823.2013.769496			DEC 1 2013	2013	Buddhist ascetic monks and hermits that move largely outside of the institutional structures of the monastic order (sangha) have a long history in mainland Southeast Asia. In Lao Buddhism these figures seem to have largely disappeared, but due to their charismatic qualities they still occupy a crucial position in the social imaginary. This article explores rumours and narratives about the existence of ascetic monks and hermits in contemporary Laos. I argue that rumours about, and narratives of, spectral apparitions of these figures express a longing for Buddhist charisma that is partially rooted in Laos' revolutionary past, and in recent social and economic changes. As Buddhist charisma can point to alternative, personalised sources of power, I argue that rumours and spectral apparitions can be interpreted as haunting, and therefore afflicting and challenging the current politics of religion of the Lao state.									0	0	0	0	0	1035-7823		WOS:000326354100006

The imaginary space created through the representation of these figures shares many traits in common with another typical feature of shjo comics, namely their exoticisation of Europe. Both have been used as simultaneously escapist and subversive strategies, as a refuge from contemporary social norms and a platform for critical reflection. In this article, I aim to problematise our understanding of the connection between gender bending and exoticism in shjo manga through an analysis of the representation of one specific aspect of European culture - namely, the Christian religion - in the genre of Boys Love manga.									0	0	0	0	0	1035-7823		WOS:000326354100008		
J	Poon, Angelia								Common Ground, Multiple Claims: Representing and Constructing Singapore's "Heartland"								ASIAN STUDIES REVIEW				37	4			559	576		10.1080/10357823.2013.844768			DEC 1 2013	2013	This article examines the various meanings of heartland and heartlander in Singapore that emerged as the city-state embarked on its transformation into a global city in the 1990s. It discusses the political and ideological nature of these terms, including the way the state has tended to deploy them and the ways they are used in public discourse. The terms' usage serves as a measure of the state's not unproblematic attempts to define its citizenry in order to reinscribe its legitimacy. The deployment of the terms by non-state actors and individuals, however, indicates greater civic involvement in national self-identification, which complicates the official state version. The article focuses on two significant Singapore texts that contribute to the cultural imaginary of the heartland and the heartlander - the novel Heartland by Daren Shiau and the film Eating Air by Kelvin Tong and Jasmine Ng. In implicit opposition to the state view, these creative works seek to convey a sense of the local and of national authenticity through their creative representation of the Singapore heartland and what it means to be a heartlander, disclosing in the process various social tensions, silences and cultural blind spots.									0	0	0	0	0	1035-7823		WOS:000326354100009

Models of capitalism are conceived of as geographical imaginaries', discursive entities by means of which nations mediate their economic fortunes vis-a-vis global capitalism. By drawing upon historical narratives and stereotypical attributions of national character, these models legitimize courses of political and economic action. A Critical Discourse Analysis of media texts is carried out in selected periods of the crisis in these two countries whose economic models have been held to be opposing geographical adversaries' in the history of neoliberalism. The article draws conclusions about the nature of recovery' from the point of view of such geographical imaginaries, and their importance in the continued dominance of neoliberalism.									0	0	0	0	0	1475-9551		WOS:000325959400002

Our reading of these discourses is very much guided by the notion of the dialectic as developed by Fredric Jameson, and as such this paper can be read as an attempt to put his theoretical ideas to work. Through our dialectical reading, we aim to create a certain estrangement effect that makes the imaginary of recovery seem very odd and unnatural. In order to achieve such an effect, we postulate four theses which are deliberately antagonistic: first, there has been no crisis of capitalism'; second, we must change the valence of the GFC from negative to positive; third, the relationship between finance capitalism and free markets' is deeply contradictory; and fourth, we must resist the regulation discourse.									0	0	0	0	0	1475-9551		WOS:000325959400003		
J	Bettini, Giovanni; Karaliotas, Lazaros				Bettini, Giovanni/E-6253-2014				Exploring the limits of peak oil: naturalising the political, de-politicising energy								GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL				179	4			331	341		10.1111/geoj.12024			DEC 2013	2013	Peak oil has acquired prominence in the political lexicon of an increasing number of critical and radical perspectives during the ongoing ecological and economic crisis. By examining examples within academia as well as initiatives such as the Degrowth Movement and the Transition Network, this paper documents how a series of red-green discourses and movements mobilise the narrative of peak oil as an alarm bell that signals the inevitability of the present ecological crises and of the coming collapse of the fossil-fuel economy. The paper, developing an analysis on two levels, argues that the red-green' mobilisation of peak oil is problematic. First, a close reading of red-green discourses shows how the weaknesses of the narrative highlighted in the literature (such as a naturalising and de-politicising understanding of the materiality and finitude of oil) are reproduced by the red-greens. Second, building on discourse and political theory, the paper highlights that red-green interpellations of peak oil fail to transcend hegemonic discursive structurations in the field of environmental and energy security, where geopolitical apocalyptic imaginaries and biopolitical forms of securitisation are linked in reproducing post-politicisation processes. Hence, the paper insists that the invocation of peak oil forecloses the possibilities for radical alternatives to the present socio-ecological regime of accumulation and circulation.									1	0	0	0	1	0016-7398		WOS:000326398900005		
J	Lay, Bronwyn								Imaginary Exile								LIFE WRITING				10	4			441	458		10.1080/14484528.2013.810321			DEC 1 2013	2013	Imaginary Exile' wanders through the experience of reading and life reflection and traces the narrative journey of the poet Ovid in David Malouf's influential novella An Imaginary Life, which serves as both anchor and disruption to an attachment to exile. The essay follows the forced corporeal movement of the author from virginal Australian bush, into inner urban landscapes and finally the abstraction of the Law. Exile is revealed as a utopic colonial fantasy in conflict with the author's intention to engage with contemporary realities. The writer's desire to hold onto Aristotelian form is confronted by the appearance of a memory that refuses to succumb to the writers demand for craft, and thus shreds her expectations of lineal narrative. This experience of a collision between two worlds, two laws, that occurred in 1998 in a Broome courtroom, challenges romantic attachments to a language prior to law or one that can escape the world' but also challenges the capacity of the writer to incorporate into text visceral experiences that conflict with received inheritances. The images and thought behind the memoir are heavily influenced by the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben, and his notion of the contemporary,' but while the author finds solace in retreat, questions of how to engage with the contemporary world linger and are passed on.									0	0	0	0	0	1448-4528		WOS:000326369700005

Drawing attention to a classic literary representation of regional space which is in the cosmopolitan Sanskrit and not in the vernacular, the paper examines Kalhana's twelfth century Rajatarangini for its depiction of Kashmir. It looks at some of the constituent elements of the spatial imaginary constructed in the text, and at the literary and discursive strategies employed in its construction, including the reworking of intertextual traditions from within Sanskrit literary culture. This essay suggests that more than an objectivist historical narrative which modern historians like to believe it is, the Rajatarangini should be viewed as a whole as the traditional kavya that it is, representing a specific language practice articulative of the poet's vision.									0	0	0	0	0	0376-9836		WOS:000346362000002

In spite of the increased recognition of the importance of situational variables, a literature and methodological toolkit for the study of situational influences that is comparable with those available for individual variables has not yet emerged. However, the recently developed Riverside Situational Q-sort provides a novel method for quantifying subjective impressions of any situation. This proof-of-concept demonstration asked participants to complete the RSQ in response to an imaginary food crisis situation communicated via one of three message sources (social media, organizational website and traditional media). Results illustrate the potential of this method to provide quantitative evaluations of subjective responses to crisis situations.									0	0	0	0	0	0966-0879		WOS:000326707000006		
J	Dalley, Hamish								The Idea of "Third Generation Nigerian Literature": Conceptualizing Historical Change and Territorial Affiliation in the Contemporary Nigerian Novel								RESEARCH IN AFRICAN LITERATURES				44	4			15	34					WIN 2013	2013	Recent critical discourse on Nigerian fiction employs historicizing techniques that categorize texts according to generations, each of which is presumed to share formal and political qualities and represent a distinct stage in national literary development. This essay critiques the prevalent "Third Generation Nigerian Literature" concept by highlighting its reliance on spatio-temporal constructs that fail to account for the complexity of the texts it classifies. Through a close reading of Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani's I Do Not Come to You by Chance (2009) and Teju Cole's Open City (2011), I show that recent Nigerian novels are shaped around ambivalent spatio-temporal imaginaries that exceed the national-generational framework. Nwaubani's novel explores characters' attempts to establish clear boundaries of ethical affiliation, while Cole's dramatizes imaginative border crossing and cosmopolitan de-centeredness. I show that both are traversed by alternative temporalities and spatialities that deconstruct their dominant frameworks. I therefore suggest that this ambivalence should prompt us to reflect on how our analyses of "Third Generation Nigerian Literature" could be enriched by exploring more multilayered methods of historicization beyond the nation-generational approach.									0	0	0	0	0	0034-5210		WOS:000326846200002

In particular, it examines the development of a number of arts programs targeted at low-income neighborhoods in the city. The twin objectives of these programs are to (a) foster creative and entrepreneurial subjectivities among at-risk youth, and (b) reduce the risk of violence that is presumed to be associated with youths living in poor neighborhoods. The paper analyzes how these two discourses are intertwined in a neoliberal politics devoted to enhancing regional quality-of-life competitiveness and to branding Toronto as an attractive creative-class destination.									1	0	0	0	1	0272-3638		WOS:000326672100006

Imagining the Future: Evidence for a Hippocampal Contribution to Constructive Processing								HIPPOCAMPUS				23	12			1150	1161		10.1002/hipo.22152			DEC 2013	2013	Imagining future events and remembering past events rely on a common core network, but several regions within this networkincluding the hippocampusshow increased activity for imagining future events compared to remembering past events. It remains unclear whether this hippocampal activity reflects processes related to the demands of constructing details retrieved across disparate episodic memories into coherent imaginary events, encoding these events into memory, novelty detection, or some combination of these processes. We manipulated the degree of constructive processing by comparing activity associated with the initial construction of an imagined scenario with the re-construction of an imagined scenario (imagine vs. re-imagine). After accounting for effects of novelty and subsequent memory, we found that a region in the hippocampus was preferentially activated for newly constructed imagined events compared with re-imagined events. Our results suggest that the hippocampus may support several distinct but related processes that are critical for imagining future events, and they also indicate that a particular region within posterior hippocampus may uniquely contribute to the construction of imagined future events.

It starts by drawing a distinction between the contemporary knowledge on real Siberia and the stereotypical features of fictional "Siberia", a huge plane eternally covered by snow and situated beyond a line going from Saint-Petersburg to Moscow. In order to define this world, this essay focuses particularly on the way its borders are defined through the feelings expressed by characters in novels and plays. The paper goes on to analyze the access to fictional Siberia, especially the passage of Urals in novels of Alexandre Dumas and Jules Verne, which mark it as the way into an imaginary world of cold exoticism. It finally considers a vaudeville by Lh,rie et Brunswick dating from 1836: by staging a simulated trip to Siberia, this play allows its audience to follow the construction of an imaginary Siberia. Comparable to fictional immersion, this process unveils fictional Siberia as a giant playground built for a game of "make believe".									0	0	0	0	0	0324-4652		WOS:000327089400002

J	Almeida, Rogério de								Aprendizagem de desaprender: Machado de Assis e a pedagogia da escolha	Learning to unlearn: Machado de Assis and the pedagogy of choice							Educação e Pesquisa				39	4			1001	1016		10.1590/S1517-97022013000400012			2013-12	2013	This study results from research on the tragic imaginary of the works of Machado de Assis and its relation with the dimensions of choice in education, considered from a philosophical perspective. The question asked relates to the educational deployment of Machado's thought, which presupposes unlearning in order to reach the choice of approval of existence - a route taken by his characters since the stage of his work consensually regarded as mature, inaugurated by the publication of Memórias póstumas de Brás Cubas (Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas). My aim is to understand the tragic imaginary expressed by the notions of nothing, chance and convention, as well as by the conditions for choosing to approve. The methodological path appropriated phenomenology and hermeneutics in the analysis of Machado's work and, as a result, pointed to an education whose philosophical foundations are the possible choice between the unconditional approval of existence and conditioned approval. In the case of the Machadian option, approval is manifested by the relativization of the references of meaning, by the questioning of belief, by adhesion to circumstances, by recognition of the spectacle, the strength of opinions and social conventions, and by affirming the ephemeral character of life, of human contradictions and of the conjunction of adverse reality and will to live.		O presente estudo resulta de uma pesquisa sobre o imaginário trágico da obra de Machado de Assis e sua relação com as dimensões da escolha no âmbito da educação, considerada em perspectiva filosófica. A questão que se coloca relaciona-se ao desdobramento educacional do pensamento machadiano, que pressupõe uma passagem pela desaprendizagem para se chegar à escolha da aprovação da existência - itinerário percorrido por seus personagens a partir da fase de sua obra consensualmente dita madura, inaugurada pela publicação de Memórias póstumas de Brás Cubas. O objetivo é compreender o imaginário trágico, expresso pelas noções de nada, acaso e convenção, bem como as condições para a escolha da aprovação. O trajeto metodológico apropriou-se da fenomenologia e da hermenêutica na análise da obra machadiana e, como resultado, apontou para uma educação cujas bases filosóficas se assentam na escolha possível entre a aprovação incondicional da existência e a aprovação condicionada. No caso da opção machadiana, a aprovação se manifesta pela relativização das referências de sentido, pelo questionamento da crença, pela adesão às circunstâncias, pelo reconhecimento do espetáculo, da força das opiniões e das convenções sociais, e pela afirmação do caráter efêmero da vida, das contradições humanas e da conjunção entre realidade adversa e vontade de viver.							0	0	0	0	0	1517-9702		SCIELO:S1517-97022013000400012		
J	D’ Antoni, Maurizia								Educación superior en Costa Rica: ¿“Rankización” y descolonización?	Higher Education in Costa Rica: Ranking and decolonization?							Revista Electrónica Educare				17	3			21	40					2013-12	2013	This essay contrasts the decolonization proposal of the being and of knowledge with the imaginary in the public university and in “the quality assurance policies”, its purposes, and relation to production methods. The author states that developing distrust towards all forms of colonization of knowledge represent a “quality improvement” in higher education. The main findings refer to the need of discussing the risks within the “improvement” and homogenization processes in higher education having, as a relevant and inherent aspect, an epistemological detachment task as a decolonization key from the public university in Costa Rica.	En este ensayo me propongo oponer la propuesta descolonizadora del ser y del conocimiento con el imaginario en la universidad pública y en las “políticas de garantía de calidad”, sus propósitos y relación con el modo de producción. Planteo que desarrollar desconfianza hacia todas las modalidades colonizadoras en el conocimiento, por sí mismo “mejora la calidad” de la educación superior. Las principales conclusiones se refieren a la necesidad de discutir los riesgos de los procesos de “mejora” y de equiparación en la educación superior, indicando como relacionada y pertinente una tarea de desprendimiento epistemológico en clave descolonizadora de la universidad pública en Costa Rica.								0	0	0	0	0	1409-4258		SCIELO:S1409-42582013000300002		
J	Davies, Gail								Arguably big biology: Sociology, spatiality and the knockout mouse project								BIOSOCIETIES				8	4			417	431		10.1057/biosoc.2013.25			DEC 2013	2013	Following the completion of the Human Genome Project (HGP), a critical challenge has been how to make biological sense of the amassed sequence data and translate this into clinical applications. A range of large biological research projects, as well as more distributed experimental collaborations, are seeking to realise this through translational research initiatives and postgenomic approaches. Drawing on interviews with key participants, this article explores the biological assumptions, sociological challenges and spatial imaginaries at play in arguments around one of these developments, which is using genetically altered mice to understand gene function. The knockout mouse project (KOMP) is a large-scale initiative in functional genomics, seeking to produce a 'knockout mouse' for each gene in the mouse's genome, which can then be used to answer questions about gene function in mammals. KOMP is frequently framed as one successor to the HGP, emblematic of the ambitions of internationally coordinated biological research. However, the development of new technologies for generating and managing genetically altered mice, alongside the challenge of asking biologically meaningful questions of vast numbers of animals, is creating new frictions in this extension and intensification of biological research practices. This article introduces two separate approaches to the future of international research using mutant mice as stakeholders to negotiate the biological, sociological and spatial challenges of collaboration. The first centres on the directed research practices and sociological assumptions of KOMP, as individual researchers are reorganised around shared animals, databases and infrastructures. The second highlights an alternative vision of the future of biomedical research, using distributed management to enhance the sensitivities and efficiencies of existing experimental practices over space. These exemplify two different tactics in the organisation of an 'arguably' big biology. They also critically embody different sociological and spatial imaginaries for the collaborative practices of international translational research.									1	0	0	0	1	1745-8552		WOS:000327738300004

The UK bank was the first of its type in the world, opening in 2004, and the Spanish bank used it as a role model in its own development. Both banks structure their operations in response to how their staffs imagine the publics in their nation make trust judgements about their work. Differences between the workings of each bank can be traced to differences in the collective imaginings operating at each banktermed institutional imaginaries'about how publics think. The UK bank sustains an imaginary in which distance lends legitimacy and disengagement signifies correct moral practice. It conjures a public that values a steady, safe and reliable institutionfree from potential conflict of interestabout which the less news the better. This stands in contrast to the Spanish bank that conjures a public that retains an interest in legitimate, ethical guardianship of stem cell material, but which is less worried about conflict of interest in attaining this. Instead, for the Spanish institution, engagement with science and the media through the projection of the bank as cutting edge is deemed crucial for maintaining public support.									0	0	0	0	0	0950-5431		WOS:000327369700006		
J	Welsh, Ian; Wynne, Brian								Science, Scientism and Imaginaries of Publics in the UK: Passive Objects, Incipient Threats								SCIENCE AS CULTURE				22	4	SI		540	566		10.1080/14636778.2013.764072			DEC 1 2013	2013	Two-way public engagement with science is an important modern democratic practice that paradoxically coincides with the intensifications of state surveillance and policing of publics and social movements engaging with issues involving science. This raises important questions about the contemporary anatomies of publics, and what count as legitimate expressions of public concern over scientific stakes within the knowledge economy. Implicit in the tension between inclusion and surveillance are concerns over the social meaning and authority of science amongst both scientific practitioners and publics. Bringing science and technology studies (STS) and social movement studies (SMS) into dialogue offers a means to explore the neglected ontological stakes in the framing of scientific imaginaries of publics, and public imaginaries of science. Post-WWII UK science-publics relations have emerged in three significant modalities, with publics imagined: as passive non-entities, circa 1950-1990 (continuing); as incipient threats due to presumed deficits in their grasp of science 1990-2000 (continuing); and, since circa 2000, as politicised threats requiring state control. Each modality is shaped by elite denial of the normative commitments embedded within science as surrogate politicsscientism. In each mode, scientistic elite emphasis on epistemic issues forecloses engagement with broader public meanings expressing legitimate normative and ontological differences. Fusing the more epistemic focus of STS with SMS's emphasis on meaning and democratic process offers a route to deeper democratic forms of public engagement with what is called science, which would also precipitate more accountability in elite discourses around science and technology.									1	0	0	0	1	0950-5431		WOS:000327369700008		
J	Atkinson, David								Geographical imaginations, public education and the everyday worlds of Fascist Italy								JOURNAL OF MODERN ITALIAN STUDIES				18	5			561	579		10.1080/1354571X.2013.839487			DEC 1 2013	2013	This article explores the phenomena of geographical imaginations and their seldom-noted promotion within various corners of Fascist Italy. Imagined geographies are socially constructed understandings of other places and regions and, as such, they are malleable, contingent, shifting and unquantifiable. Nevertheless, these imaginaries help us to navigate our imaginative worlds and our relative place in the material world. In 1930s Italy, various interest groups associated with the colonial and expansionist projects of Fascism promoted the development of wider geographical imaginaries among Italians. Academic geographers were often key figures in these initiatives: some prompted these projects, while others did so at the behest of the regime and its desire to expand Italians' coscienza geografica (the geographical imagination) to an imperial level'. This article explores how academic geographers from Trieste sought to contribute to this project and to embed their geographical knowledge into the ordinary, everyday circuits of public life. The article therefore outlines the notion of the geographical imagination and demonstrates via case studies how Triestine geographers tried to nurture these phenomena. Finally, it suggests that, although elusive and amorphous, geographical imaginations were a feature of everyday life in some corners of Fascist Italy and, as such, they deserve academic attention.									0	0	0	0	0	1354-571X		WOS:000327834000001		
J	Horrocks, Chris								Disinterring the Present: Science Fiction, Media Technology and the Ends of the Archive								JOURNAL OF VISUAL CULTURE				12	3			414	430		10.1177/1470412913504522			DEC 2013	2013	This article examines the relationship between the actual and fictional archive and science fiction. It highlights the role of technological obsolescence and anachronism as it appears in the writing of JG Ballard and Jacques Derrida in order to argue that the process of media transition, destruction and disinterment are integral to representations of the imaginary archive. The author examines Derrida's deconstruction of Freud's archive in order to identity his use of retrospective science fiction' and underline the term's importance in addressing media transition in relation to the archive. It then takes the archived remains of Ballard's unfinished short story in the Vermilion Sands collection to link the phenomenology of writing technology with processes of collecting, construction, disinterment and destruction. It concludes that Derrida's retrospective science-fiction model might be reversed to consider the archive in terms of its post-archival function.									0	0	0	0	0	1470-4129		WOS:000328224700005		
J	Dawood, Shezad								Piercing Brightness as an Exploration of the An-archic Imaginary (in conversation with Mark Bartlett)								JOURNAL OF VISUAL CULTURE				12	3			431	449		10.1177/1470412913504374			DEC 2013	2013	Over the summer of 2011, Shezad Dawood went into production on his first feature film: Piercing Brightness, in Preston, Lancashire, in the North-West of England, after two years of research in the city, and in wider networks and archives suggested by this initial research. Interested in any case in the interplay between existing and self-created archives, for the artist the project became a way to explore the hybrid and allegorical potential of overlapping different film and video formats and different sets of meanings. As an additional layer, and based on Dawood's interest in how artist's film was and might be read between cinema and gallery, Dawood also made two additional cuts' of Piercing Brightness: Trailer, a 15-minute version for gallery installation (that plays with the semantics of cinema, yet altering and transferring them to the gallery), and a special 40-minute version, only to be performed with a live score by Acid Mothers Temple, or Alexander Tucker's Decompressed Orchestra (playing with Dawood's interest in both expanded cinema and improvised music). These approaches are further interrogated and discussed in the following dialogue between Dawood, and academic and art/film historian Mark Bartlett, who became a regular interlocutor of Dawood's in the lead-up to and over the course of the production. Their ongoing conversation looks at the concept of an an-archive, in relation to Foucault's citation of Borges: alter-taxonomy' in relation to the overarching schemata of Piercing Brightness, presented here as a series of image grids.									0	0	0	0	0	1470-4129		WOS:000328224700006

J	Kim, Jongchul								Modern Politics as a Trust Scheme and Its Relevance to Modern Banking								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES				47	4			807	826		10.2753/JEI0021-3624470401			DEC 2013	2013	The trust is, by definition, a hybrid between rights in rem and rights in personam. It is also an English legal concept that distinguishes the English common law from the Roman law tradition of continental Europe. The trust is largely absent in the classical writings of Karl Marx and Max Weber on the origins and nature of capitalism. This essay demonstrates that the trust is central to an adequate understanding of capitalism - including the capitalist institutions of modern banking, corporations, and representative democracy - and demonstrates that modern banking and politics are mirror images of each other. Before capitalism, credit economies created institutions to protect debtors or often revived the social order by cancelling debts. The capitalist credit economy, by contrast, considers strict debt obligations a supreme moral good and a way of securing social order. It creates a political scheme to ensure that debt obligations are strictly fulfilled. This essay argues that this scheme is a trust. The trust turns the debts of individuals, whose death can cancel their debt obligations, into the debts of imaginary groups such as the modern state, whose identities and obligations are permanently maintained by replaceable trustees. The essay further holds that without the politics of the trust, modern banking could not have developed.									0	0	0	0	0	0021-3624		WOS:000328263300001

The field is rapidly growing and being widely promoted, attracting attention in diverse arenas. These include those of the social sciences, where some researchers have been encouraged by the resonance between imaginaries of development within epigenetics and social theory. Yet, sustained attention from science and technology studies (STS) scholars to epigenetics and the praxis it propels has been lacking. In this article, we reflexively consider some of the ways in which epigenetics is being constructed as an area of biomedical novelty and discuss the content and logics underlying the ambivalent promises being made by scientists working in this area. We then reflect on the scope, limits and future of engagements between epigenetics and the social sciences. Our discussion is situated within wider literatures on biomedicine and society, the politics of interventionist STS, and on the problems of caseness within empirical social science.									3	0	0	0	3	1463-6778		WOS:000327930500006

Becoming Mughal in the Nineteenth Century: The Case of the Bhopal Princely State								SOUTH ASIA-JOURNAL OF SOUTH ASIAN STUDIES				36	4			479	495		10.1080/00856401.2013.788465			DEC 1 2013	2013	In 1861, Nawab Sikandar Begum, the female ruler of Bhopal, toured Northern India for six months. The journey and its narration in the Taj al-iqbal (1873) were part of a broader project of princely self-fashioning aimed at both indigenous and British audiences. Taking the example of the Begums of Bhopal, this article engages with debates about travel and its relevance to the emergence of a nationalist imaginary, but also of its continuity with alternative visions in the latter half of the nineteenth century. The paper draws upon the insights of revisionist literature on princely states, which stress that princes at the mercy of British power nevertheless remained figures of indigenous authority, retaining a precarious autonomy in their territories. The Begums of Bhopal were able to turn their status as loyalists' towards consolidating a Mughal' aesthetic by recruiting artists, scholars and poets to underscore the state's autonomy.									0	0	0	0	0	0085-6401		WOS:000328728500001		
J	Kaur, Raminder								The Nuclear Imaginary and Indian Popular Cinema								SOUTH ASIA-JOURNAL OF SOUTH ASIAN STUDIES				36	4			539	553		10.1080/00856401.2013.831393			DEC 1 2013	2013	In this article I consider the interface between state policy and popular culture by examining the issue of nuclear weapons in and around Indian popular cinema. Whilst it has been pointed out that there are no cinematic examples of nuclear annihilation in Indian film, I propose instead that the threat of it is nevertheless evident. Nuclear technology is deeply entangled in anxieties about the nation, its constituents such as the family, and its detractors such as forces to do with communalism and separatism. These disquieting dynamics do not enable a straightforward alliance between the nuclear and the national as official state discourse would have it, where nuclear weapons are advocated as a measure of India's military might in the contemporary era, or in other words, nuclear nationalism'. Rather than being nation-builders, films present nuclear weapons as dangerous nation-destroyers, for missiles harbour threats to people and civilisations especially in the hands of the figurative terrorist and those with designs against the nation of India. With this formulation there lies a latent critique of state policy, which nevertheless is imbued with patriotic rhetoric by the end of the film, when the hero averts disaster and/or invokes the state as the paragon of nuclear management.									0	0	0	0	0	0085-6401		WOS:000328728500004		
J	Siddiqi, Yumna								Bombay noir: violence, intrigue, and politics in Salman Rushdie's The Moor's Last Sigh								TEXTUAL PRACTICE				27	7			1217	1236		10.1080/0950236X.2013.821158			DEC 1 2013	2013	In The Moor's Last Sigh, Rushdie portrays the transformation of Bombay from a cosmopolitan city to one dominated by communalist forces, and explores the political violence this has engendered. He does not see violence per se as a threat to the vitality and political survival of India; rather, he is critical of the increased influence of right-wing Hindu supremacist parties such as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Shiv Sena, and the city's turn to a specifically fascist form of violence directed against Muslims and other perceived outsiders, seen, for example, in the riots in late 1992 and early 1993. While Rushdie largely attributes this violence to the masculinist and fundamentalist thinking of the Shiv Sena's cadres, he obliquely acknowledges the ways in which parties such as the Shiv Sena have inserted themselves into the terrain of what Partha Chatterjee calls political society in postcolonial India. At the end of the novel, Rushdie turns his reader's gaze beyond the nation to an imaginary town in Andalucian Spain. He projects onto this fictional space two contrasting visions of the global: a present-day paranoid, dystopic vision that critic Emily Apter calls one-worldedness', and a more optimistic vision of transnational consanguinity. The two different visions of Bombay, the cosmopolitan and the noir vision, anticipate these two different visions of the global.									0	0	0	0	0	0950-236X		WOS:000328468300007

It takes as a case study a specific Australia-Korea cultural event that linked large screens in Federation Square, Melbourne, and Tomorrow City, Incheon,(1) through the presentation of SMS-based interactive media art works. The article combines theoretical analyses of global citizenship, mobility, digital technologies, and networked public space with empirical analyses of audience response research data collected during the screen event. The central argument is that large public screens can offer a strategic site for examining transformations in the constitution of public agency in a digitized, globalized environment. The idea of aesthetic cosmopolitanism' is finally proposed as a conceptual framework for understanding how new forms of transnational public agency in mediated public spaces might operate.									0	0	0	0	0	0263-2764		WOS:000328103000016		
J	Gordon, Elyse								Under-served and un-deserving: Youth empowerment programs, poverty discourses and subject formation								GEOFORUM				50				107	116		10.1016/j.geoforum.2013.08.008			DEC 2013	2013	Youth gardening empowerment organizations are growing in popularity as an urban model for youth-focused nonprofit work within the United States. These organizations aim towards progressive goals of poverty alleviation through holistic youth empowerment but encounter tensions between the imperatives of funders to distinguish (or discipline) youth in terms of performance and their own impulse to include all those in need. Despite benevolent mission statements, however, these organizations perpetuate long-standing poverty discourses that distinguish between deserving and undeserving poor subjects. I explore these tensions through fieldwork with Youth Grow, one such youth gardening empowerment organization in Seattle, Washington. I argue that residual poverty discourses persist due to the contradictory positioning of progressive organizations within a neoliberalized landscape of social service provisioning. This nexus, between donor dependence and cultural imaginaries about poverty, produces the mismatch between relational program goals and residual practices. I propose a more self-reflexive approach to programming that considers the subjective, lived experiences of youth participants in relation to the material and discursive frictions that create these tensions.

Yet methods based on brain network analysis of functional connectivity have been scarcely investigated. As a result we use graph theoretic methods to investigate the functional connectivity and brain network measures in order to characterize imagery hand movements in a set of healthy subjects. The results of the present study show that functional connectivity analysis and minimum spanning tree (MST) parameters allow to successfully discriminate between imagery hand movements (both right and left) and resting state conditions. In conclusion, this paper shows that brain network analysis of EEG functional connectivity could represent an efficient alternative to more classical local activation based approaches. Furthermore, it also suggests the shift toward methods based on the characterization of a limited set of fundamental functional connections that disclose salient network topological features.									3	0	3	0	3	0219-6352		WOS:000329180800003	24372064	
J	Fisher, Jill A.								Expanding the Frame of "Voluntariness" in Informed Consent: Structural Coercion and the Power of Social and Economic Context								KENNEDY INSTITUTE OF ETHICS JOURNAL				23	4			355	379					DEC 2013	2013	This paper introduces the term "structural coercion" to underscore the ways in which broader social, economic, and political contexts act upon individuals to compel them to enroll as subjects in clinical research. The paper challenges the adequacy of the concepts of "coercion" and "undue influence" in determining when research participation is voluntary. Acknowledging structural coercion shifts the frame of ethical deliberation away from specific individuals and specific studies to see important patterns in research participation by salient demographic characteristics. The effects of structural coercion manifest themselves in particular research settings, but unlike the conventional form of coercion, it is not rooted in the researcher participant relationship or linked to particular study protocols. By extracting voluntariness from entrenched conceptions of the researcher participant dyad, this paper proposes approaches to minimize the effects of structural coercion while creating new ethical imaginaries for review boards and researchers alike.									0	0	0	0	0	1054-6863		WOS:000328718600004	24552076

J	Decultot, Elisabeth								From the Museum of Images to the Musee Imaginaire (Museum without Walls): Albums of Antiquities and the Tradition of Paper Museums in the 17th and 18th Centuries								REVUE DE L ART					182			19	26					DEC 2013	2013	Antiquarians in the 17th and 18th centuries compiled ample bodies of graphic reproductions of Antique works of art. These albums assumed diverse forms collections essentially composed of drawings on the model of Cassiano dal Pozzo's Muse Cartaceo in the first half of the 17th century or series of engravings with commentaries, bound as books, on the model of Bernard de Montfaucon's Antiquite Expliquee et Representee en Figures, 1719-1725. While these collections share a number of characteristics with the museum, the particular nature of their common support the images of antique objects, and not the objects themselves links them to a specific sort of museum that could be called "imaginary" for more than one reason. In the very vast ensemble of questions raised by these paper museums, this study will concentrate on one examination in particular. To what measure did the images of Antique art contained in the albums of Antiquities contribute to the birth of a particular form of art history, namely art history through images that preceded by several decades art history by narration that develops at the end of the 18th century, following particularly Winckelmann's work on the history of Antique art? What link exists between these two forms of history? Do they maintain a relation of model to counter-model as suggested by certain representatives of "modern" art history, with Winckelmann himself in the front line? Or are they tied to each other, despite disclaimers, by a hidden connection of affiliation? This study attempts to find several elements in response to these questions, by examining some of the paper museums, which, in the 17th and 18th centuries, took Antique art as their object.									0	0	0	0	0	0035-1326		WOS:000328868200004		
J	Girard, Marie-Helene								Theophile Gautier and the Musee Imaginaire								REVUE DE L ART					182			35	42					DEC 2013	2013	Theophile Gautier, indefatigable and self-styled art pilgrim and writer-journalist from 1831 to 1872, was an ardent champion of the museum. The Etudes sur les Musees (Museum Studies) written in 1849-1850, the accounts that pepper his travel narratives and above all his description of the Louvre in Hugo's Pads Guide (1867) all attest to his advocacy on behalf of the institution of the museum. His ambitious goal was to describe works of art in such a way as to give the reader a written equivalent of the work, or rather of the experience of the work, by using a technique he referred to as transposition. His aims were pedagogical, encyclopedic, and curatorial. Although Gautier had long believed in the civilising virtues of the work of art, following his reading of Part II of Goethe's Faust, translated and commented by Nerval in 1840, he also became convinced that past forms of beauty live on as so many shadows in the mythical "kingdom of Mothers" and that it was the role of the writer and of the artist to bring them back to life in a kind of ultimate imaginary museum. This museum without walls molded Gautier's views on museums within walls. It also ensured that his celebration of actual museums and his numerous descriptions of the treasures they housed could move beyond the preoccupations with national heritage he had shared with Hugo and Merimee since the 1830s. As the 1867 writings included in the posthumous editions of the Guide de l'amateur au musee du Louvre (Art Lover's Guide to the Louvre) show, the critical authority Gautier had gained early his career allowed him to perpetuate a canon and format the gaze of his contemporaries. This radical collection of texts, both encyclopedic and literary in character, does indeed anticipate Malraux's Museum without Walls.									0	0	0	0	0	0035-1326		WOS:000328868200006		
J	Coggins, Garance								The "Museums without Walls on the Web"								REVUE DE L ART					182			71	78					DEC 2013	2013	It is possible to consider the Web as an extension of Malraux's "Musee Imaginaire" (Museum without Walls), even though this takes place through the use of new techniques for the reproduction and the circulation of images. By studying three specific projects on the Web that can be included in the lineage of the museum without walls, it is possible to study the issues that extend and those that renew the imaginary of the Musee Imaginaire.

J	Gilleard, Chris; Higgs, Paul				Higgs, Paul/C-1328-2009	Higgs, Paul/0000-0003-0077-0710			The fourth age and the concept of a 'social imaginary': A theoretical excursus								JOURNAL OF AGING STUDIES				27	4			368	376		10.1016/j.jaging.2013.08.004			DEC 2013	2013	This paper explores the idea of the 'fourth age' as a form of social imaginary. During the latter half of the twentieth century and beyond, the cultural framing of old age and its modern institutionalisation within society began to lose some of its former chronological coherence. The 'pre-modern' distinction made between the status of 'the elder' and the state of 'senility' has re-emerged in the 'late modern' distinction between the 'third' and the 'fourth' age. The centuries-old distaste for and fear of old age as 'senility' has been compounded by the growing medicalization of later life, the emergence and expansion of competing narratives associated with the third age, and the progressive 'densification' of the disabilities within the older institutionalised population. The result can be seen as the emergence of a 'late modern' social imaginary deemed as the fourth age. This paper outlines the theoretical evolution of the concept of a social imaginary and demonstrates its relevance to aging studies and its applicability to the fourth age. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Children's intervention strategies in situations of victimization by bullying: Social cognitions of outsiders versus defenders								JOURNAL OF SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY				51	6			669	682		10.1016/j.jsp.2013.09.002			DEC 2013	2013	This study examined the social cognitions of outsiders and defenders about intervening in situations of victimization by bullying. Do outsiders and defenders behave differently in victimization situations because of differences in competence beliefs, or because of a selectivity effect in intervening? These issues were examined in a sample of 102 outsiders and 107 defenders who were classified into these bullying roles through a peer-nomination procedure out of a total sample of 761 10- to 14-year-old Dutch children. These children were presented with imaginary victimization events. They answered questions about their cognitions and self-efficacy beliefs about intervening in victimization situations and about handling such situations. Outsiders, compared to defenders, claimed to intervene indirectly in victimization situations rather than directly. Defenders, compared to outsiders, claimed to intervene directly in victimization situations rather than indirectly. Both outsiders and defenders claimed to be more likely to intervene when a friend was being victimized than when a neutral classmate was being victimized. Outsiders and defenders did not differ in their self-efficacy for indirect intervention, but only defenders claimed a high self-efficacy for direct intervention. Both outsiders and defenders claimed to benefit from direct help when they themselves are victimized, but only outsiders also reported to need indirect help. The results suggest that outsiders and defenders behave differently in victimization situations because of differences in competence beliefs rather than because of a selectivity effect. More generally, the results suggest that not only defenders but also outsiders have the intention to help children who are being bullied. However, outsiders' anti-bullying attempts are likely to be indirect and less firm than those of defenders. (C) 2013 Society for the Study of School Psychology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The aim was to contribute towards empirical investigations on the dominant social representations in the contemporary imaginary, through analyzing the front-page images of magazines on life, health and disease. The messages carried sought to cause an impression, to be attractive and, especially, to be convincing. This led to an analysis on the rhetoric, with its capacity to convince through words strengthened through the image. This paper comprises a theoretical essay on the methodology of rhetoric analysis, and it presents preliminary field results gathered in Porto Alegre and Rio de Janeiro. This approach contributes towards analyzing the social role of dissemination of the biosciences within present-day culture.

J	Santolinii, Arnaud; Danis, Agnes; Bourdais, Cecile; Bruneau, Laure; Tijus, Charles								Development of the appearance-reality representation between 3 and 5 years: A matter of abstraction and integration of perceptual and functional properties of the object?								ANNEE PSYCHOLOGIQUE				113	4			547	574					DEC 2013	2013	Our research focuses on the development of representations of perceptual and functional properties of objects using appearance-reality tasks that were solved by 64 children aged 3 to 5 years. The materials of the selected tasks included various objects ambiguous realistic, symbolic, and imaginary in a cartoon in order to vary the proximity between the function evoked by the appearance of the object and the function related to its reality. The design of the study counterbalanced assessing appearance after demonstration of reality and assessing reality after the demonstration of fictitious property in order to investigate the ability of the child to change the representation of the object. Results show, for the 3-year-olds, a preponderance of "phenomenalists errors" for symbolic objects as well as for the cartoon task, but a preponderance of "realistic mistakes" for realistic objects. The responses of 4-year-olds were centered on functional properties, and this in all events. Only 5-year-olds children were solving the problem of objects identity of the object and were easily changing the object's representation. The results are discussed with emphasis on the theory of H. Wallon.									0	0	0	0	0	0003-5033		WOS:000330145800003		
J	Szerszynski, Bronislaw; Galarraga, Maialen								Geoengineering knowledge: interdisciplinarity and the shaping of climate engineering research								ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A				45	12			2817	2824		10.1068/a45647			DEC 2013	2013	In this paper we highlight the need to attend to the structuring power of knowledge production in geoengineering research, because of the way that problem definitions are shaped by disciplinary ways of thinking and describing the world. We also draw attention to a number of problematic assumptions about how interdisciplinary research should be approached and organised in this area. We first look at the logic of 'subordination', in which certain disciplines are given the task of problem definition and others-typically the social sciences-are allocated the task of filling in gaps within that given frame. We then examine the more fundamental 'integrative imaginary' which, we argue, mistakenly assumes that disciplines can be combined in a straightforward way to reveal different aspects of the same underlying world. We conclude by proposing a more reflexive imaginary for interdisciplinarity, one that challenges the idea of integration and subordination, that promotes and benefits from the multiplicity and heterogeneity of ways of seeing that different disciplines offer, and that can thereby contribute to greater 'epistemological responsibility' in geoengineering research.									2	0	0	0	2	0308-518X		WOS:000330188100005		
J	Clark, Nigel								Geoengineering and geologic politics								ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A				45	12			2825	2832		10.1068/a45646			DEC 2013	2013	Early engagement with geoengineering by social scientists indicates a certain suspicion over the motives and modes of operation of scientific research in the field. In part, this reflects the prominence of the critique of the politics of emergency in recent social and political thought: a thematisation that links securitisation measures with foreclosures of the political. This paper turns the attention back on the social sciences, arguing that recent styles of ontological and political thought do not prepare us well for engaging with geologic issues in general, and geoengineering in particular. It is suggested that, rather than viewing geoengineering discourses and imaginaries as a retreat from politics, we might view them as playing an important role in opening up new kinds of politics oriented towards earth systems and their dynamics. This new 'geologic politics' involves a turn from issues hinging on territorial divisions of the earth's surface toward the strata that compose the deep temporal earth. As a political challenge, the question of how to live with dynamic and stratified earth systems not only promises to extend the scope of politics, but also points to the 'inhuman' limits of the political per se.									2	0	0	0	2	0308-518X		WOS:000330188100006		
J	Rahbek, Ulla								'REPPING YOUR ENDS': IMAGINED BORDERS IN RECENT BRITISH MULTICULTURAL FICTION								LITERATURE AND THEOLOGY				27	4			426	438		10.1093/litthe/frt037			DEC 2013	2013	This article explores the phenomenon of imagined borders in recent multicultural British fiction. Focussing on Sunjeev Sahota's Ours Are the Streets (2011), Bernadine Evaristo's Hello Mum (2010), and Stephen Kelman's Pigeon English (2011), it suggests that borders figure here in a very different way from the celebratory mode of much border theory and many earlier multicultural novels (e. g. Zadie Smith's White Teeth). Drawing on Diener and Hagen's Borders (2012) as well as on general ideas about borders by Homi Bhabha, Kenan Malik, Salman Rushdie, Arjun Appadurai, and other thinkers, the article argues that in recent multicultural British fiction about gangs and (potential) fundamentalist terrorism, borders are common spatial tropes and unambiguous, if imaginary, markers that you cross at your peril.									0	0	0	0	0	0269-1205		WOS:000330193000004		
J	Heister, Hanns-Werner; Singer, Deborah								Mimetic Ceremonies and Other Non-violent Methods of Ruling. On the Role of Music in the Guarani-Reducciones of Jesuits in 17th- and 18th-century Paraguay								INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF THE AESTHETICS AND SOCIOLOGY OF MUSIC				44	2			213	238					DEC 2013	2013	The Jesuit missions (reducciones or misiones) existed from 1609 to 1768 in the border regions of today's Brazil, Paraguay and Northern Argentina. In these settlements the Guarani groups were concentrated in order to: 1) protect them from Spanish exploitation and Portuguese slave hunters; 2) to realize the process of Christianization without impediments and comprehensively; 3) to facilitate the reeducation in accordance with Western standards of the time. Particularly in the case of sacral ceremonies, of both Guarani and Catholic origins, both cultures articulate and activate the aesthetical in a similar fashion as an essential prerequisite for cognition, as a giving of meaning and as a representation of the world. In service of proselytizing all senses were meant to be addressed, thereby augmenting the intensity and effectiveness of Europeanization and insuring its long-term effectiveness all this while employing minimal costs and force in the largely ineffective use of violence: The concept of the 'Mimetic Ceremony' is particularly useful for gaining an understanding of this concentration of the socially operant aesthetical: 1) All members of a group participate in it in practical-aesthetical ways (feasts and opera performances can severe as a model for comparison); 2) Through the sensual-aesthetic dimension the mimetic ceremony intensifies the everyday experience, and it involves and encompasses all areas of the senses, from the distance-related senses hearing and seeing to the close-up senses; 3) The Mimetic Ceremony takes place in the mode of the imaginary-real and the 'other state' (in contrast to the 'normal state'), at a structural (temporal and local) as well as functional distance/structurally (temporally and locally) as well as functionally removed from everyday life; 4) All this makes cathartic effects possible, at least to some extent, i.e. to resolve psychological issues and mediate social contradictions, so that through the aesthetically communicated superstructuring the sense of community as well as the own societal involvement is activated and affirmed. Mimetic Ceremony exists both as secular ceremony as well as sacral ritual.The ceremonies provided a shared platform for both cultures, albeit in an admittedly asymmetrical context of the mission project. For example, the martial archangel St Michael is equated with the mythological Guarani warriors. In another case, the maracas, reserved for sacral actions by the Guarani, are used as musical instruments during Catholic ceremonies. Furthermore, the ceremonies offered the Guarani the possibility of active, though only imaginary-real resistance through the reinterpretation of the strange signs of the colonizer, setting them in opposition to the goals of the missionaries. This allowed for strategies against colonization which would lastly ensure the survival of Guarani culture.									0	0	0	0	0	0351-5796		WOS:000330414600001

I discuss the ways that Bunyan wrestles with these changes in light of Taylor's work on secularization, and theorize that Bunyan's text reveals how the sacred and secular imaginaries were able to merge through a shared embrace of an economic system of rationalization. Additionally, and more tragically, both ideologies share a disdain for love in its vulnerable, intimate, and material forms that has led us to desire security instead of attending to a more humble (but powerful and enriching) need for assurance. I conclude by discussing Adorno's discussion of love and Auschwitz as a warning still necessary in our 21st century secular age.									0	0	0	0	0	2077-1444		WOS:000330317500013

It focuses on the study of violence from the subjectivity and, therefore, it uses the notion of mediations (mediaciones) of Martin-Barbero (2002, 2003), the reception studies of Orozco (1997) and the work of Imbert (2003, 2004). Violence claims a valid interpretation in symbolic terms, from media representations to construction in the collective imaginary. This discussion is emerging as an academic urgency, as it is needed to determine whether citizens have come to naturalize and legitimize - from mediation - violence and crime in Latin America.

The purpose which guided the observation was to determine whether the regional press, in a context of reasonable suspicion regarding such links, fulfilled its role of "watchdog of democracy", by denouncing irregular behaviors in the pre-election and post-election period; if they defended political interests or remained neutral. The observation was made in three departments of electoral risk, in order to analyze how was the press coverage that received these candidates in 14 selected media, including national and regional newspapers with that scope of coverage.

J	King, Emily L.								Spirited flesh: The animation and hybridization of flesh in the early modern imaginary								POSTMEDIEVAL-A JOURNAL OF MEDIEVAL CULTURAL STUDIES				4	4			479	490		10.1057/pmed.2013.34			WIN 2013	2013	While early modern scholarship presupposes the dichotomy of flesh and spirit, such conclusions ignore the constitutive ambiguity of flesh in the early modern world. To illustrate this ambiguity, I turn to two major archives: Helikiah Crooke's medical treatise Microcosmographia: A Description of the Body of Man (1615) and William Tyndale's Prologue to the Romans in his translation of the New Testament (1534). These texts gesture toward the reality of 'spirited' flesh, a flesh that possesses a form of liveliness persisting beyond physical severance from the body or even biological death. This spirited flesh is radicalized further in John Marston's Antonio's Revenge (1602), as dead flesh exists in a synecdochical relationship with the spirit. Yet Marston's characterization of flesh emerges not as an early modern quirk or an occasion of dramatic heresy but rather as one supported by contemporary discourses of science and religion.									0	0	0	0	0	2040-5960		WOS:000331450400008

Linking the Roman past to the present of historical destruction and colonialism, these novels also establish a relationship between the old protagonist and a child or youth, representative of absolute innocence and authenticity, who finally walks away, dissolves or dies. In their interrupted state, these youths cannot become the future and can only presage utopia. Having held up the image of a different future and a different historical time, the novels show that only in the acknowledgment of historical contingencies can one recognize a responsibility towards generations past and yet to come, and towards those who are not "us."									0	0	0	0	0	1481-4374		WOS:000331449200003		
J	Grishakova, Marina								Complexity, Hybridity, and Comparative Literature								CLCWEB-COMPARATIVE LITERATURE AND CULTURE				15	7	SI				5	10.7771/1481-4374.2379			DEC 2013	2013	In her article "Complexity, Hybridity, and Comparative Literature" Marina Grishakova discusses "implied hybridity" in discourses, aesthetic systems, and media as a form of emergent complexity as distinct from hybridity resulting from the mixture or blending of heterogeneous elements. Grishakova argues that complexity theories widely used in social sciences and, to a lesser extent, in literary and cultural studies, suggest a possibility to avoid dualistic thinking and offer a flexible conceptual framework for comparative literature studies. Aesthetic systems, as part of society's "imaginary," respond to, and reorganize in response to, impulses received from other domains, but also modify their environments and forge new imaginaries. The difficulty of sustaining the paradoxes of complexity presents a challenge for comparative literature scholars as part of the "positive uncertainty" of the discipline.									0	0	0	0	0	1481-4374		WOS:000331449200005		
J	Krasovec, Joze								Double Eternity and Poetic Imagery of Jerusalem as the Centre of the World								EPHEMERIDES THEOLOGICAE LOVANIENSES				89	4			383	396		10.2143/ETL.89.4.3011225			DEC 2013	2013	The unique status of Jerusalem comprises the motifs of election of Jerusalem and its Temple as a permanent divine presence and of Zion as God's chosen mountain. This makes Jerusalem the physical and spiritual centre of the world. Interpreters of ancient Jewish and Christian sources are puzzled by this dilemma: how literally are Jerusalem's claims and promises to be taken in view of descriptions of Jerusalem in metaphorical, hyperbolic poetic and eschatological terms? The rhetorical antithesis between the Jerusalem of God's plan and the Jerusalem of Israel's apostasy, between the vision and the reality, between Earthly or carnal and Heavenly or spiritual Jerusalem became inevitable. Consequently, Jerusalem has been interpreted in theology, liturgy and art in realistic, imaginary, idealistic, and symbolic ways. The aim of the article is to show how more than one conceptual point of view can be deduced from the context of some crucial texts of the Old and New Testaments and from non-Biblical Jewish and Christian sources.									0	0	0	0	0	0013-9513		WOS:000333067100007

Bearing on a qualitative approach, a case study is being conducted to describe the relevant cultural elements and their bearing on the company's management. A conclusion is then reached that the values and the imaginary are a cultural asset in the organization and its management model, because they both strengthen up the workers' sense of belonging, thus helping develop the company's projection and sustainability strategies. The review of management practices and organizational culture provides lessons which organizations of this sort could benefit from, as well as those operating in line with the traditional ownership scheme.

J	Nacach, Gabriela								La producción de imaginarios indígenas en el censo nacional de 1895: Chaco y Tierra del Fuego en perspectiva comparada	The national census of 1895 and the production of indigenous imaginaries: comparative perspective between Chaco and Tierra del Fuego							Memoria americana					21-2			26	47					2013-12	2013	By late nineteenth century the political-scientific speeches and practices associated with the construction of the Argentine national state contributed to a differential incorporation of the indigenous population. In this paper we analyze the marks towards alterity provided by Census enumerators in the National Territories of Chaco and Tierra del Fuego. The ethnic and national classifications, as well as the construction of local diversities provided by these agents, will show us suggestive indicators related to the thesis of extinction and massive incorporation of the indigenous as a homogeneous and undifferentiated group (indios). The idea that such state representations not only settled down successfully in the nineteenth century s collective imagination, but persist strongly today underlies the historical analysis. Finally we ask about the state role as producer of imaginaries of Otherness, needed to establish national ethnic boundaries.	Hacia fines del siglo XIX, los discursos y las prácticas político-científicas asociados al proceso de construcción material y simbólica del Estado nacional argentino contribuyeron a la progresiva incorporación diferenciada de los indígenas. Nos proponemos analizar las marcas hacia la alteridad proporcionadas por los empadronadores del Censo de 1895 - últimos eslabones de la cadena censal- en los Territorios Nacionales de Chaco y Tierra del Fuego. Las clasificaciones étnicas y nacionales y la construcción de diversidades locales proporcionadas por estos agentes mostrarán indicadores sugestivos sobre la tesis de la extinción y la masiva incorporación de los indígenas como grupo homogéneo e indiferenciado (indios). La idea subyacente es que dichas representaciones estatales no solo han sedimentado con éxito en el imaginario colectivo del siglo XIX sino que subsisten con fuerza actualmente. Además, nos interrogamos por el rol del Estado como productor de imaginarios de Otredad e instaurador oficial de las fronteras étnicas nacionales.								0	0	0	0	0	1851-3751		SCIELO:S1851-37512013000200002

It is part of an exploratory study that sought to investigate the possibilities of integration of youth cultures at school cultures, particularly in the area called high-school or secondary school. To account for this, it was necessary to enter in the imaginary ones that teachers built on youth, youth cultures and school cultures. This way, this article tries to describe these «imaginary ones», trying to accede to the existing shades, to identify the tensions that emerge from the constructions that realize respect of the cultures that were investigated and his possibilities of integration and comprehension. The article is closed, with an interpretive exercise, which allows to understand the information produced from the categories of: «juvenile prejudices and the question of gender»; the nonexistence of a clear vision on the part of the teachers of what they are the juvenile cultures; as the idea of that «the teacher has never been young» and, some metaphors of the school.	La finalidad de este artículo es entregar una aproximación a los «imaginarios» que tienen los profesores de colegios municipalizados, particulares subvencionados y particulares, respecto de sus estudiantes, sus culturas y la cultura escolar que ellos portan al interior de las escuelas. Es parte de una investigación exploratoria, que buscaba indagar en las posibilidades de integración de las culturas juveniles a las culturas escolares, particularmente en el espacio llamado liceo o escuela secundaria. Para dar cuenta de esto, fue necesario introducirse en los imaginarios que construyen los profesores sobre los jóvenes, las culturas juveniles y las culturas escolares. Así, este artículo se propone describir esos «imaginarios», intentando acceder a los matices existentes, para identificar las tensiones que emergen a partir de las construcciones que se realizan respecto de las culturas que se investigaron y sus posibilidades de integración y comprensión. Se cierra el artículo, con un ejercicio interpretativo, que permite entender la información producida desde las categorías de «prejuicios juveniles» y la cuestión de «género»; la inexistencia de una visión clara por parte de los profesores de lo que son las culturas juveniles; como la idea de que «el profesor nunca ha sido joven» y, algunas metáforas de la escuela.

J	Cerviño, Mariana								Sobre la construcción de un habitus disidente: Jorge Gumier Maier (1953‐1984)	On the construction of a dissident habitus: Jorge Gumier Maier (1953‐1984)							Trabajo y sociedad					21			317	336					2013-12	2013	This article aims to observe the intellectual production fields that remained active during the last dictatorship in Argentina. We propose to interprete the values involved in the different artistic options and practices of Jorge Gumier Miaer, in order to identify the symbolic, political and moral universes that define the type of social actor he represents. His mode of construction as intellectual, place him at a type who we can call "vocational" and "dissident". The first trait refers to the particular relationship he builds with the culture goods, where art is inseparable from life. The second of its properties refers that other regularity we can follow in his options: in differents ways, they are always opposed to the dominant values and criteria of the global society. From his family background, and fragments of its interventions in alternative and oppossed publications within the dictatorship, we track the genesis of the dispositions of Gumier Maier (his habitus). His intellectual interventions let us identifie an artistic and intellectual ethos, that goes more beyond its case, representing a type of agents inside the peripheric area of the cultural field through the period, that emerge into the field itself, from the return of democracy. We will regard, on one hand the evolution of the field since 1978 to 1984, and secondly, the elements of continuity that link the social spaces around cultural publications as El Expreso Imaginario (The imaginary express), El Porteño (The Porteño) and Sodoma (Sodom).	El presente artículo propone recuperar el concepto de habitus para identificar los rasgos que definen una orientación disidente en la trayectoria de Jorge Gumier Maier. Nos proponemos observar en un itinerario singular los sentidos que enlazan determinadas opciones de valor, en algunos espacios del campo de producción intelectual que persistieron activos durante la última dictadura en Argentina. Queremos destacar en el itinerario intelectual de JGM, quien incorpora y vincula universos simbólicos, políticos y morales que marcan las sucesivas opciones prácticas configurando un tipo de intelectual. Definimos ese tipo como disidente, porque consideramos que su rasgo distintivo es un modo de vincularse con los bienes culturales, en el cual juegan un papel central elementos de un habitus compartido, cuya constante es la oposición a los criterios dominantes. A través de su origen familiar, y de los universos sociales en los cuales tienen lugar distintas etapas de su socialización fuera y dentro del campo de la producción cultural, intentamos rastrear la génesis de las disposiciones de Gumier Maier que lo orientan hacia la realización de posiciones de ruptura con respecto a los criterios dominantes. En contraste con el tipo de intelectual legítimo que había hegemonizado el espacio público del campo, el de JGM permite ver la construcción de un tipo de intelectual marcado por la vivencia de la homosexualidad y un tipo específico de activismo sexual. En el estudio de su itinerario observaremos así, por un lado la evolución del campo entre 1978 y 1984, y por otro, los elementos de continuidad que vinculan a esos espacios sociales, a partir de las intervenciones de JGM en las publicaciones culturales El Expreso Imaginario, El Porteño y Sodoma.								0	0	0	0	0	1514-6871		SCIELO:S1514-68712013000200020

In particular, we analyze how management, linked to the employment policies of a steel company, justifies the widespread use of outsourcing and temporary contracts through moral imputations against young people. Based on an extensive fieldwork carried out in two years (2010-2012) with youths and adults that maintain different ties with the factory, we show how the management's statements invoke to a social imaginary widely shared by adult workers in justifying the labor flexibilization of the youths. Young people are forced to wander about for several years in unstable jobs before they are considered as candidates for entering the protected core of the factory. Thus outsourcing is constituted as a key mechanism in the consolidation of job insecurity.	Este artículo es un aporte a la reflexión sobre los modos en que las grandes empresas despliegan dispositivos altamente complejos, con el propósito de garantizar la reproducción del capital a través de la gestión de modos de empleo flexible. En particular analizamos cómo las políticas de empleo de una empresa siderúrgica, legitiman la precarización laboral apelando a imputaciones de orden moral contra los jóvenes. Basándonos en un extenso trabajo de campo realizado durante dos años (2010-2012) con jóvenes y adultos relacionados con la fábrica, mostraremos cómo los dichos del gerente de relaciones con la comunidad, interpelan a un imaginario social difundido entre los trabajadores adultos, para justificar la inestabilidad y los bajos estándares laborales entre los jóvenes que se ven confinados por varios años a deambular por empresas contratistas. Es así como la tercerización se constituye como un mecanismo clave en la consolidación de la precariedad laboral.								0	0	0	0	0	1514-6871		SCIELO:S1514-68712013000200025

Revista de Historia Regional y Local				5	10			53	97					2013-12	2013	The 1920s was a decade that witnessed in Latin American the appearance of a number of cultural vanguards that questioned the reality of their countries seeking changes in the social and political structure of their nations. The Colombian Liberal politicians, in their desire for to govern to Colombia, recognized in them a number of ideas that influenced his political development. The reforms of Alfonso Lopez Pumarejo sought a rapprochement with the artists looking a series of artistic proposals that involved the society for to aware of its history and identity. Under these guidelines Pedro Nel Gómez was contracted to decorate the town hall of Medellin with a series of murals for to meet this purpose. The artist presented nine frescoes arousing controversy for of the call of social consciousness that did painting the main problems of the country. This not only earned him the nickname socialist but that years later led to censorship. This text tries to interpret these murals as a source of historical knowledge and see in them the social problems of the thirties Colombian expressed by the artist from his Marxist socialist thought and influence.

Con las reformas de Alfonso López Pumarejo se buscó un acercamiento con los artistas para que estos desarrollaran una tipología de arte en la que se involucrara a la sociedad y así ésta tomara conciencia de su historia e idiosincrasia.

The importance of the study appears from the need to know this historical period in which it is registered in the majority of the histories of life of the teachers that we did in Colombia. On this matter, we wonder on: which are public policies and imaginaries that they have presented in the legislation and financing of the primary school Colombian educator, and the reliability and changeability of the norm come up by the teachers' syndicates from 1952 to 1994? We are located under the political history and the conceptual frame of the social history of the education and the mentalities. The methodology compared the criteria of government policies in the financing of the education, teachers' movements across syndicates, teacher's levels, they allowed us to analyze the impact and the imaginary social one of the Colombian educator. The strategies teachers had to face from the analysis of the legislation up to the concrete cases of historical facts that motivated changes in the regulation of the teaching. Thus, we take as precedents, in the colonial epoch, the reform of 1774 and the XIXth century we based the information on the years 1870 and 1892. In the XXth century we are focused on the period on from 1913 to 1952. The first date when there is established the retirement pension for the teachers and the second one when the teaching performance is regulated. The second period we took up the issue of the Teacher Statute concluded in 1979 with the union of Colombian Federation of Educators (FECODE). FECODE and it is in updated in most of the articles. We ended the third period, Act 115 of 1994 to represent the current policy towards the education sector. The conclusion is that the law has a social imaginary about the teacher mediated through the public policy and in particular the concept of the political parties that have legislated on this educator and not least is the mediation of regional unions and national who has the conception and employment status which have joined other professions are challenging identity and competitiveness.	El objeto del presente trabajo se orienta a demostrar que en Colombia se presenta una legislación escolar, hacia el educador del nivel de enseñanza primaria, direccionada según la política pública que se cristaliza en reformas que presentan un marcado sello, según el gobierno político que las expida en su momento. La relevancia del estudio se plantea desde la necesidad de conocer este período histórico en el cual se inscribió la mayoría de las historias de vida de las maestras que analizamos en Colombia. Al respecto, nos preguntamos sobre ¿cuáles son las políticas públicas e imaginarios que se han presentado en la legislación y financiación del educador colombiano, en el nivel de la primaria, y la aplicabilidad y variabilidad de la norma, mediados por los sindicatos de maestros de 1952 a 1994? Nos sustentamos en la historia política bajo el marco conceptual de la historia social de la educación y las mentalidades. La metodología comparada bajo criterios de políticas gubernamentales en la financiación de la educación, movimientos de maestros por medio de sindicatos, escalafón docente y salarios nos permitieron analizar el impacto y el imaginario social del educador colombiano. Las estrategias se orientan desde el análisis de la legislación hasta los casos concretos de hechos históricos que motivaron cambios en la normativa docente. En este sentido, tomamos como antecedentes, en la época colonial, la reforma de 1774 y el en siglo XIX nos centramos en la de 1870 y 1892. En el siglo XX nos centramos en el período de 1913 a 1952. La primera fecha, cuando se establece la pensión de jubilación para los maestros, y, la segunda, cuando se reglamenta el desempeño docente. El segundo período lo llevamos hasta la expedición del Estatuto Docente en 1979, concertado con la organización sindical de Federación Colombiana de Educadores, FECODE, que está vigente en la mayoría de sus artículos. Finalizamos, el tercer período, en la Ley 115 de 1994, por representar la política vigente hacia el sector educativo. Se concluye que la legislación presenta un imaginario social sobre el maestro, mediado por la política pública y en especial por la concepción de los partidos políticos que han legislado sobre este educador y no menos importante es la mediación de los sindicatos regionales y el nacional, que han revindicado una concepción y estado laboral al cual se han unido otras profesiones que presentan un reto de identidades y competitividad laboral.	O objetivo do presente trabalho se orienta a demonstrar que na Colômbia se apresenta uma legislação escolar, para o educador de nível de ensino primário, direcionada segundo a política pública que se cristaliza em reformas, as quais apresentam uma característica marcada pelo governo político que as enuncie em seu momento. A relevância do estudo se justifica pela necessidade de conhecer este período histórico no qual se inscreveu a maioria da pesquisa sobre as histórias de vida das professoras que realizamos na Colômbia. A esse respeito, nos questionamos sobre: quais são as políticas públicas e imaginários que se apresentaram na legislação e financiamento do educador colombiano, no nível primário, e a aplicabilidade e variabilidade da norma mediadas pelos sindicatos de professores de 1952 a 1994? Baseamo-nos na história política sob o marco conceitual da história social da educação e das mentalidades. A metodologia comparada sob critérios de políticas governamentais no financiamento da educação, movimentos de professores através de sindicatos, escalão docente e salários, nos permitiram analisar o impacto e o imaginário social do educador colombiano. As estratégias se orientam desde a análise da legislação até os casos concretos de fatos históricos que motivaram mudanças na normativa docente. Nesse sentido, tomamos como antecedentes, na época colonial, a reforma de 1774 e o século XIX, e nos centramos no período de 1913 a 1952. A primeira data, quando se estabelece a pensão de jubilação para os professores, e a segunda, quando se regulamentam o desempenho docente. O segundo período abrange desde a expedição do Estatuto Docente em 1979, concertado com a organização sindical da Federação Colombiana de Educadores, FECODE, e que está vigente na maioria de seus artigos. Finalizando, o terceiro período, na Lei 115 de 1994, por representar a política vigente para o setor educativo. Concluise que a legislação apresenta um imaginário social sobre o professor mediado pela política pública, e, em especial, pela concepção dos partidos políticos que legislaram sobre este educador e não menos importante é a mediação dos sindicatos regionais e o nacional que reivindicaram uma concepção e estado laboral ao qual se uniram outros profissionais que apresentam um desafio de identidades e competitividade laboral.							0	0	0	0	0	0122-7238		SCIELO:S0122-72382013000200008

Within this framework, the author considers the emergence of a sphere of political experimentation that seeks to modernize culture as a whole in order to eliminate colonial practices and imaginaries. It also identifies a strong presence of interpersonal contacts with foreign thinkers and a process of intensifying the circulation of knowledge that proved useful to the government project. In this respect, the author seeks to prove that attempts are made to construct legitimization from the constant interaction between the practices introduced by the new political model and the knowledge disseminated close to the Republican matrix.	Este artículo tiene por objetivo analizar la relación entre el accionar político y el clima intelectual durante la gestión de gobierno de Bernardino Rivadavia en Buenos Aires, 1821-1827. En este marco, se considera la emergencia de un espacio de experimentación política que procura modernizar la cultura en su conjunto con el fin de eliminar las prácticas y los imaginarios coloniales. Asimismo, se identifica una fuerte presencia de contactos interpersonales con pensadores extranjeros y un proceso de intensificación en la circulación de saberes que resultaron funcionales al proyecto del gobierno. En tal sentido, se desea demostrar que el proceso de legitimación intenta construirse a partir de la interacción constante entre las prácticas introducidas por el nuevo modelo político y los saberes difundidos cercanos a la matriz republicana.								0	0	0	0	0	0186-0348		SCIELO:S0186-03482013000300003		
J	Silva, Gislene da; Soares, Rosana de Lima								O jornalismo como tradução: fabulação narrativa e imaginário social	Journalism as translation: narrative fable and social imaginary							Galáxia (São Paulo)				13	26			110	121		10.1590/S1982-25532013000300009			2013-12	2013	This paper proposes to link together two seemingly unrelated fields, journalism and translation studies. One of its objectives is to demonstrate possibilities that go beyond the traditional view that journalism translates everyday facts for those who did not experience them, that linguistic translation interprets original texts for those who cannot decode them, and that the mode of expression of both these processes is reliable, objective and truthful. These views share a belief in certain dichotomies, such as the separation between truth and language, referentiality and fictionality, reality and fantasy, fact and narrative. Thus, our aim is to question the tradition of journalistic objectivity and textual fidelity by assuming the narrative character of these discourses and their cultural aspects, and the implications of this for the social imaginary.		A proposta deste trabalho é articular dois campos aparentemente desconexos, os estudos de jornalismo e de tradução. Tem entre seus objetivos demonstrar possibilidades que ultrapassem a visão hegemônica de que o jornalismo mostra fatos cotidianos para aqueles que não os vivenciaram e que a tradução linguística traduz textos originais para os que não podem decodificá-los, ambos os processos afeitos ao modo fiel, objetivo e veraz. Tais visões compartilham a crença em certas dicotomias, como a separação entre verdade e linguagem, referencialidade e ficcionalidade, realidade e fantasia, fato e relato. Busca-se, desse modo, questionar a tradição da objetividade jornalística e da fidelidade ao texto por meio da assunção do caráter narrativo desses discursos e das marcas culturais neles presentes e das implicações disso no imaginário social.							0	0	0	0	0	1982-2553		SCIELO:S1982-25532013000300009

J	Boer, Roland								Lenin on Tolstoy: Between Imaginary Resolution and Revolutionary Christian Communism								SCIENCE & SOCIETY				78	1			41	60					JAN 2014	2014	Lenin's criticisms of Tolstoy, spread over half a dozen articles, provide both an anticipatory insight and a blind spot. The insight is that they offer the first example of what would later be called an imaginary resolution of real social and economic conditions. The contradictions of Tolstoy's works are manifested as, on the one hand, incisive critiques of the depredations of the transition between feudalism and capitalism, and, on the other, as inadequate and unarticulated solutions. But these contradictions give voice to the contradictory political situation of the peasants. The blind spot is that Lenin dismisses Tolstoy's response - non-resistance to evil and the recovery of the simple life of Christian devotion and poverty - as reactionary and misguided. What Lenin fails to register is that both elements of Tolstoy's works - the simplicity of collective life as well as the incisive and revolutionary critiques (which Lenin wished to appropriate for the socialists) come out of the tradition of revolutionary Christian communism.									0	0	0	0	0	0036-8237		WOS:000327815400003		
J	Rakopoulos, Theodoros								Cooperative modulations: the antimafia movement and struggles over land and cooperativism in eight Sicilian municipalities								JOURNAL OF MODERN ITALIAN STUDIES				19	1			15	33		10.1080/1354571X.2014.851964			JAN 1 2014	2014	Debate on the antimafia movement has placed the phenomenon mainly in the urban civil society tradition of new Italian social movements. While acknowledging the resonance of antimafia mobilization in this context, this article explores a different tradition, wherein struggles against the mafia in Sicily are analysed alongside, and in constant interconnection with, the development of the agrarian cooperative movement of the island. Focusing on the Alto Belice area of western Sicily, the article argues that antimafia politics evolved from an association with agricultural workers' cooperativism in an anti-middleman direction after the 1950s land reform. Moreover, it assesses ethnographically how this tradition has influenced actors in the contemporary, largely successful, movement of antimafia cooperatives that cultivate land confiscated from the mafia by the Italian state. It examines how these actors link to this genealogy, associating their contemporary activity, in largely imaginary ways, to this history of struggles, and claiming inheritance over it.									2	0	0	0	2	1354-571X		WOS:000328103300002

Not only is the concept of dialogicality highly relevant for the psychology of difference but it also poses many strong meta/theoretical challenges. Second, therefore, I rapidly evaluate psychology's disciplinary developmental status and transformative potentials of Bakhtinian dialogicalism in/for psychological discourses. I pay particular attention to the (im)possibilities of a potential dialogue between psycho-logic/-logy and dia-logic/-logue in reference to our biosociocultural (real-symbolic-imaginary) human be(com)ings. Thus, while triangulating, reframing and refracting with/in my seemingly more radically pluralist and dynamic perspective, using some core notions from its conceptual matrix for(potentially) self-reflective transformative-transformations, such as triopus and transformational trialectics, it is hoped that the fascination with pragmatics of dialogicality would not overshadow the concept's hermeneutically transformative utility which asks for serious dialogical confrontations, insights, bold philosophical commitments and consistent knowledge-practices in/towards all areas of our human(e) worlds.

J	Fredericks, Rosalind								"The Old Man is Dead": Hip Hop and the Arts of Citizenship of Senegalese Youth								ANTIPODE				46	1			130	148		10.1111/anti.12036			JAN 2014	2014	The 2012 Senegalese presidential elections engulfed the country in unprecedented controversy, violence, and protest. Urban youth in Dakar animated the massive opposition movement that eventually led to the incumbent's defeat through voter registration, public critique, and mass mobilization. Two prominent factors fomenting youth action were the direct engagement of a host of well known rappers and the pervasive power of hip hop culture. This article probes the valence of the globalized art form of hip hop as a medium of political identity formation and a language of resistance in these elections through considering the spatial practices and imaginaries of rappers and their followers. It argues that hip hop fosters new geographies of citizenship inspiring urban youth to transgress prescribed boundaries in allowed speech and political behavior to make new claims on their city and nation. Insight is drawn for understanding youth politics, the power of music, and questions of urban citizenship.									2	0	0	0	2	0066-4812		WOS:000329288400008		
J	Grubbauer, Monika								Architecture, Economic Imaginaries and Urban Politics: The Office Tower as Socially Classifying Device								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF URBAN AND REGIONAL RESEARCH				38	1			336	359		10.1111/1468-2427.12110			JAN 2014	2014	In recent studies on the role of architecture in urban restructuring, city marketing and the related struggles for meaning, there has been a focus on high-profile architects and iconic architecture. In this article I wish to examine architecture and building types as socially signifying devices', in order to take more everyday buildings and their images into account as well. Using Vienna as a case study, I explore how the commercial office tower is utilized to represent the internationalization of the local economy and render new urban political-economic strategies socially meaningful. This is done by examining recent shifts in urban policy, and the means, channels and practices of discursive and visual representation of the local office architecture. Connecting the concept of economic imaginaries from cultural political economy (CPE) with a sociological approach to building types, I argue that economic imaginaries gain in plausibility if they are discursively and visually anchored in urban space. However, it is also shown that this kind of spatialization of new economic imaginaries is constructed on a selective visual representation of buildings: the assignment of international economic activities to local office towers is revealed to be only partially true in the case of Vienna.									2	0	0	0	2	0309-1317		WOS:000328747200018		
J	Kelly, Michael G.

The functional importance of exemplary model works in respect of the modern French literary field is examined in the context of challenges to notions of literary tradition and transmission in the inter-war years. Radiguet's literary individuation is seen as both practically enabled and theoretically problematised by the connection to the earlier text. The individuation process, complicated additionally in this instance by Radiguet's literary and personal association with Jean Cocteau, is argued to unfold with respect to a classical imaginary that is facilitated by but independent of the actual classical intertext.									0	0	0	0	0	0028-2677		WOS:000329310600003

We monitored pupil diameters with an infrared eye tracker while participants first saw and then generated mental images of shapes that varied in luminance or complexity, while looking at an empty gray background. Participants also imagined familiar scenarios (e.g., a sunny sky or a dark room) while looking at the same neutral screen. In all experiments, participants' eye pupils dilated or constricted, respectively, in response to dark and bright imagined objects and scenarios. Shape complexity increased mental effort and pupillary sizes independently of shapes' luminance. Because the participants were unable to voluntarily constrict their eyes' pupils, the observed pupillary adjustments to imaginary light present a strong case for accounts of mental imagery as a process based on brain states similar to those that arise during perception.									9	0	3	0	9	0956-7976		WOS:000329486300021	24285432	
J	Orchard, Vivienne								'THE STORY TAKES PLACE' : CLAIRE MESSUD'S THE LAST LIFE AND THE COSMOPOLITAN IMAGINARY								FORUM FOR MODERN LANGUAGE STUDIES				50	1			1	15		10.1093/fmls/cqt026			JAN 2014	2014	The work of the Franco-American novelist Claire Messud remains under-explored. This article focuses on her 1999 novel, The Last Life, in relation to the idea of 'literary globalism'. Recent scholarship has generated work on 'world literature' as an emerging theoretical paradigm. I locate Messud's novel in relation to this generally, but more crucially to 'the cosmopolitan imaginary'. Cosmopolitanism is a key term in social theory and political philosophy but has yet to gain critical currency in relation to the literary. The work of Messud is crucial in enabling this connection because of its exploration of the legacies of Algerian decolonization in the South of France and in its negotiation of cross-cultural identities and cultural displacement.									0	0	0	0	0	0015-8518		WOS:000329867300001

In the past, the dominant focus of science, technology and society (STS) has led to a blind spot: political understanding and engagement of policy-makers and politicians with science, which is an integral part of any public engagement. Arguably, it is bound to and emerges from what Ezrahi calls collective political imaginaries. These are necessary fictions, which are causative and performative. In crude form, they manifest themselves in short-term impact measurements of every unit of scientific activity with citizens as the fictitious ultimate beneficiaries. In the future, STS can gain from coming up with a workable definition of the public interest with a focus on the public value of science. It can investigate collective imaginaries as they emerge from interactions with new media. As necessary fictions they may hold answers we never imagined them to hold.									0	0	0	0	0	0963-6625		WOS:000329687400003	24434706	
J	Urbonas, Julijonas								Gravitational Aesthetics								SPACE					554			108	116					JAN 2014	2014	To summarise 'Imaginary Traveling', the article surveyed various examples of fictitious vehicles that are either functional imaginatively or repurposed for imaginary uses. These vehicles differ in the ways they sustain the imaginary link with the public, the imaginary travellers. Some of them are constructed just as visually observable objects or installations, whereas the others are open to certain degree of participation or even literal transportation. Combining various forms of fiction and artistic genres, from cinema to sculpture and participative art, the article hypotheses a poetic version of vehicular engineering that could be considered as a unique artistic practice with its own set of creative tools and distinct field of practice. The destination of such vehicles is places and journeys that are otherwise impossible or unaccessible.									0	0	0	0	0	1228-2472		WOS:000330000100027		
J	Hawkins, Harriet; Straughan, Elizabeth R.								Nano-art, dynamic matter and the sight/sound of touch								GEOFORUM				51				130	139		10.1016/j.geoforum.2013.10.010			JAN 2014	2014	This paper offers an auto-ethnographic account of Midas, an immersive bio-media installation created by artist Paul Thomas. The experiences of the installation provide a stepping-off point for a discussion of the corporeal geographies and the nano-imaginaries that the work develops. Understanding the senses as a principle means whereby the body mingles with the world and with itself, we begin from a focus on Midas's presentation of the inter-relations of touch, vision and hearing, thereby extending geographical thinking on aurality, but also reworking the immersive geographies that are implicated within ontologies of touch. We draw out these geographies by way of the depths and passages of Irigaray's (1993) fluid ontology of touch. From here we explore the 'creative rethinking' of matter that the installation develops, exploring the organismic topographies that it develops which stand against nano-imaginaries of matter that are focused either on the corporeal violence of nano-splatter, or the understanding of nanotechnologies through the mastery and control of matter.

J	Shim, David								Remote sensing place: Satellite images as visual spatial imaginaries								GEOFORUM				51				152	160		10.1016/j.geoforum.2013.11.002			JAN 2014	2014	How do people come to know the world? How do they get a sense of place and space? Arguably, one of the ways in which they do this is through the practice of remote sensing, among which satellite imagery is one of the most widespread and potent tools of engaging, representing and constructing space. This paper argues that satellite imagery is not only a powerful means of gathering geographical and geopolitical information - for instance through overhead surveillance and the reconnaissance of sites considered suspicious - but is also decisive in producing geographical and geopolitical imaginations. Based on a discussion of the iconic satellite picture of the Korean Peninsula by night, this article shows how satellite imagery constructs - seemingly by itself - North Korea as a distant, foreign and secluded other place in world politics. Referred to in the paper as 'visual spatial imaginaries', remote sensing shapes how we imagine places, spaces and sites in what is widely believed to be a terra incognita of the world.

J	Maiguashca, Bice								'they're talkin' bout a revolution': feminism, anarchism and the politics of social change in the global justice movement								FEMINIST REVIEW					106			78	94		10.1057/fr.2013.36			JAN 2014	2014	Despite the proliferation of works on the 'global justice movement' (GJM) in recent years, surprisingly little has been written on the intersections between feminist and anarchist strands within this 'movement of movements'. In an effort to rectify this gap in the literature, this article seeks to explore in what ways and to what extent anarchist and feminist renditions of revolution, within the context of the GJM, are conceptually compatible and thereby potentially politically reinforcing. In order to ascertain the degree of convergence between these two radical projects, in the first part of the article I examine what each camp is fighting for and against and whether their struggles for social justice are ideologically consonant. In the second part, I turn my attention to the types of practices being enacted and defended by these two activist constituencies and ask how they see their respective revolutions being brought about. What notions of social change are at work here and are their political practices, and the different temporalities sustaining them, reconcilable? After arguing in the first two parts of this article that anarchism and feminism are more compatible than is often acknowledged and that the considerable synergies between feminist notions of social justice and social change and anarchist conceptions of revolution merit far more attention than they currently receive, I end the piece by reflecting on some of the points of tension that still militate against merging their respective political imaginaries. I do so in an attempt to identify what I see as the conditions of possibility for a more integrated, mutually collaborative feminist anarchist revolutionary politics.									0	0	0	0	0	0141-7789		WOS:000331611200010		
J	Carlson, Stephanie M.; White, Rachel E.; Davis-Unger, Angela C.								Evidence for a relation between executive function and pretense representation in preschool children								COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT				29				1	16		10.1016/j.cogdev.2013.09.001			JAN-MAR 2014	2014	Several theoretical formulations suggest a relation between children's pretense and executive function (EF) skills. However, there is little empirical evidence for a correlation between these constructs in early development. Preschool children (N=104; M age = 4-0) were given batteries of EF and pretense representation measures, as well as verbal, memory, and appearance-reality control tasks. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed two separable but overlapping aspects of EF (Conflict and Delay). EF was significantly related to pretense after accounting for all controls. Understanding the pretend reality distinction was strongly related to Conflict EF, whereas performing pretend actions was more strongly related to Delay EF. These results, although correlational, are consistent with the claim that EF skills are implicated in pretense, such as inhibiting reality and flexibly manipulating dual representations, and offer a potential mechanism by which pretend play interventions may enhance childhood EF.

Australia is presented to international audiences as a place of grand landscape, filled with unique bounding animals and peopled by simple, happy-go-lucky, pre-modern folk. Defying the realities of a highly urbanized, post-industrial society, this paradisiacal imagery has proven to be highly successful. Reporting the first stage of research evaluating responses of study abroad students to a course in Australian Studies, the findings demonstrate strong correspondence between the imagery of Australia circulated by tourism marketers and the imaginaries inscribed into these student tourists. Travel can disrupt such circles of representation; indeed, the rationale behind student-tourism presents a productive moral imperative to do so. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

I explore the imaginative qualities of the rituals, qualities that I refer to collectively as "virtual recentralization." "Recentralization" connotes the islanders' longing to regain their Cold War status as the focal point between China and Taiwan, even though the desired goal can only be "virtual" as cross-strait tensions continue to diminish. These pilgrimages, with their eclectic, improvisatory, and novel forms, differ from traditional pilgrimages in important ways: rather than transmitting permanent and solid religious values, they are oriented towards performance and are imbued with elements of fiction and fantasy. They are the means by which the Mazu islanders, in this neoliberal era, imagine their future, reconfigure political, economic, and religious space, and forge new connections between China, Taiwan, and even the wider world.									0	0	0	0	0	0010-4175		WOS:000332381400006

The capacity of landscape for significant and/or communicative evocation finds in intrapersonal communication a relevant argument for the construction of a theoretical framework to study the process of appropriation and experience of the landscape in terms of communicative expression. The principal aim of this paper is to set up the theoretical framework that enables us to interpret the language of landscape and to decode its intangible discourse.									0	0	0	0	0	1405-1435		WOS:000334013000001

The decisive battles of the Finnish Civil War took place on the streets of Tampere in 1918. Only 90 years later, in 2008, was the city of Tampere able to organise a remembrance process, which mediated the war memory through exhibition, street drama, online discussion forums and mainstream media. The remembrance encouraged the disclosure of hidden memories, broke down predatory stereotypes and addressed the transgenerational victimhood and the guilt. I suggest that the case exemplifies a shift in how societies remember: The contemporary, more individualised and plural societies saturated with therapeutic practices are prone to adopt bottom-up and participatory memory practices. At the same time, however, the article points to the limits of memory work. It is not a magic wand for doing away with past injustices. In Tampere, it was possible only for the grandchildren of the war generation.									0	0	0	0	0	1750-6980		WOS:000334408900007

By observing a child playing, it is easy to deduce his/ her imitation, imagination and dramatization, which are actually characteristic behaviours through which a child presents or relives his/her experiences using various symbols, for example, emotional experiences, speech or social skills. Learning and practicing social skills in an adequate and pro-social way, as well as practicing these skills through play with other children is extremely important in child's early development and education. In order to succeed in that, the educator first and foremost needs to understand the process of a child's learning in order to support and encourage the development of social skills through appropriate interventions. Furthermore, an educator has the responsibility to create a stimulating environment which will provide a child with a free choice of activities, the use of all senses and quality communication, as well as a diversity of interactions which are necessary for a pedagogical shaping of the environment appropriate for children and their ever-growing interests, knowledge and understanding. For the purpose of this research a questionnaire was constructed regarding children's play and has been applied on a sample of 198 children who attend preschool institutions. The paper considers practical implications of the results given as a means to stimulate the development of socialization processes in children's play considering their involvement in homogenous or heterogeneous educational groups.									0	0	0	0	0	1848-5189		WOS:000334390100007		
J	Sagud, Mirjana; Soco, Biserka Petrovic								Playing - Medium for Understanding, Interpreting and Transforming Immediate Reality								CROATIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION-HRVATSKI CASOPIS ZA ODGOJ I OBRAZOVANJE				16		1		279	289					2014	2014	The fundamental study or conceptualization of the development and learning of early and preschool aged children necessarily takes into consideration children's play as a medium that allows imaginative transformation of the child's observation and understanding of immediate reality. While playing, the reality is metaphorically interpreted and presented with the help of alternative scenarios, while the actual events and experiences are being re-transformed and they vary from the child's perspective. Playing is a social practice (it occurs in cooperation with others and/or with the help of conditions that others create), and as such it is a specific mode of a socio-cultural reality in which the child, due to its incapability of total understanding and only partial participation, objectively reflects its real space and it interprets and "changes" it a lot more. A child reconstructs its experience and day to day reality in an imaginary world of play, but almost always including recognizable social rules and under control of events.The daily authentic institutional context should be arranged in a way that it allows free elaboration and expression of children's experiences and which builds and develops social capacities that will allow better participation in various social groups.									0	0	0	0	0	1848-5189		WOS:000334390100019		
J	Mallard, Gregoire								Studying Tensions between Imaginary Spaces and Concrete Places: The Method of Paired Biographies Applied to Scientists' Laboratory Lives								HISTORICAL SOCIAL RESEARCH-HISTORISCHE SOZIALFORSCHUNG				39	2	SI		115	136					2014	2014	Spaces and places are at the center of the science studies scholarship. Some scholars focus on the spatial circulation of written traces; others focus on the socio-cultural hierarchies reflected in the spatial organization of the laboratories. But most privilege single-case studies as their research method. While single-case studies offer the advantage of providing rich and detailed ethnographic description of spaces, they often fail to explain how imaginary spaces of science are turned into concrete social settings, often with unexpected deviations from their creators' initial purposes. This paper argues that a comparative approach, which I call "paired biographies," can help us study the tensions between imaginary and real spaces of science. This method of paired biographies is applied here to trace the attempts (both failed and successful) by two prominent physicists (J.R. Oppenheimer and E.O. Lawrence) to turn their imaginary scientific spaces into concrete places. This comparative approach, based upon paired biographies of various laboratory lives taken at different points in time, highlights the tensions between imaginary spaces of science and concrete architectural forms (themselves located in broader environments), and shows which unexpected outcomes derive from these tensions.									1	0	0	0	1	0172-6404		WOS:000335204000005		
J	Chalmers, Damian; Barroso, Luis								What Van Gend en Loos stands for								ICON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW				12	1			105	134		10.1093/icon/mou003			JAN 2014	2014	Three transformational developments flowed from Van Gend en Loos: the central symbols and ideals of EU law; an autonomous legal order with more power than traditional treaties; and a system of individual rights and duties. The judgment also set out how each of these developments was to be deployed. The symbols and ideals were set out to proclaim EU authority rather than to go to what the EU did. What the EU did was, above all, government through law. The EU legal order was conceived, above all, therefore, as a vehicle for the expression of EU government. This, in turn, shaped the allocation of individual rights which were predominantly granted only where they furthered the realization of the collective objectives of EU government. Conceiving EU law as governmental law also left a profound and negative effect on EU legal meaning. This became shaped by EU law being reduced to something to sustain activities valued by EU government rather than to provide a wider, more emancipatory imaginary.									1	0	0	0	1	1474-2640		WOS:000334676200006

His worik, which started immediately in 1846, led to a document which contained the alignment of the buildings existing at the time, and also the future plans, consisting in the modification of some previous buildings and the creation of new ones. This plan was the first graphical instrument of this city; nevertheless, such an interesting item has been now missing since 1990.This paper summarizes the study of the only remains of the document and the work leading to its recovery through digital reconstruction.									0	0	0	0	0	1133-6137		WOS:000336077400026

When the government was proposing mandatory targets in 2007-08, public controversy over 'unsustainable biofuels' was channelled into prospects for future biofuels to avoid environmental harm and land-use conflicts. This vision serves as an imaginary-a feasible, desirable future. Societal benefits have been envisaged according to specific models of economic competitiveness, valuable knowledge, and environmental sustainability-together comprising a prevalent imaginary of future 'sustainable biofuels'. This has informed institutional change along two lines. First, targets are envisaged as a temporary transition until future 'advanced biofuels' make liquid fuel more sustainable. Second, UK research institutes realign their priorities towards seeking investment from foreign counterparts and global energy companies, in the name of making UK science and industry more competitive. Together these measures have been justified as necessary for a transition to advanced biofuels which would better contribute to a low-carbon economy. Although this imaginary may eventually be transformed into reality, initially realised has been institutional change that reinforces infrastructural dependence on liquid fuel for the internal combustion engine. As an imaginary, then, 'sustainable biofuels' can help explain how a policy agenda promotes one future, while marginalising alternatives.									1	0	0	0	1	0308-518X		WOS:000336259200004

Fantasy orientation constructs and related executive function development in preschool: Developmental benefits to executive functions by being a fantasy-oriented child								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT				38	1			62	69		10.1177/0165025413508512			JAN 2014	2014	This study explored unique constructs of fantasy orientation and whether there are developmental benefits for fantasy-oriented children. By age 3, children begin developing executive functions, with some children exhibiting high fantasy orientation in their cognitions and behaviors. Preschoolers (n = 106) completed fantasy orientation measures and executive function tasks, including parent and teacher questionnaires. Principal Component Analysis revealed four specific constructs within fantasy orientation (FO). Relations were examined between children's FO constructs and executive functions to determine if developmental benefits exist with being fantasy-oriented. Hierarchical linear regressions suggested that certain FO constructs are uniquely related to specific executive functions, such that there are potentially specific developmental benefits to being a fantasy-oriented child (i.e., inhibition and attention shift positively related to fantastical cognitions).									0	0	0	0	0	0165-0254		WOS:000335891500007		
J	Acar, Hatice; Gurel, Zeynep								Reflection of High School and Physics Education Students' Views about Satellite Motion into Their Thought Experiments								HACETTEPE UNIVERSITESI EGITIM FAKULTESI DERGISI-HACETTEPE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF EDUCATION				29	2			1	15					2014	2014	Thought experiments are executed in the mind without using equipment by operating an imaginary scenario with a specific purpose such as finding a solution, bringing an evidence, clarifying a concept, strengthening or refuting a theory. Although thought experiments have revolutionary impacts in the history of science, their role in science education has not been revealed yet. This research aims to present enlightening results about students' thought experimentation processes by investigating the effects of high school and university physics students' alternative views about satellite motion on this process. In this research, Thought Experiments Survey was applied to 50 tenth grade high school students (age 17) and 20 fourth year university students studying physics education. The data taken from a single question about satellite motion were taken within the scope of this study. Response categories were formed, and thought chains that shows the students' thought flows in each categories were drawn. Research results introduce the students' alternative views about satellite motion and show that these alternative views effect students' thought experimentation processes as deflectors in reaching the right conclusion. The results also illuminate the students' problem solving processes in the context of imaginary world.									0	0	0	0	0	1300-5340		WOS:000336822800001

J	Soane, Andrew								The First World War and perceptions of Catholicism in England								ANUARIO DE HISTORIA DE LA IGLESIA				23				137	150					2014	2014	After the First World War there was a changed, more positive, attitude in England towards Catholicism in England. It was perceived to have risen to the test of the War where other forms of religion had failed. The newly acquired optimism of Catholics found expression in the apologetics of the era. New doubts about Protestantism - tainted by imaginary association with Germany - gave Catholic apologists the opportunity to mount a largely successful polemic against the hitherto accepted biased national anti-Catholic historiography. An acknowledged classic of the genre is Hilaire Belloc's Europe and the Faith.									0	0	0	0	0	1133-0104		WOS:000336818600007

Educational commons and the new radical democratic imaginary								CRITICAL STUDIES IN EDUCATION				55	2			122	137		10.1080/17508487.2014.903502			2014	2014	This article reflects on emergent (radical-progressive) languages of democracy to consider what common educational institutions might mean today. It explores distinct philosophical and political tensions that cut across these languages in relation to educational organization and pedagogy including - antagonism versus exodus, transcendence versus immanence, pluralism versus multiplicity, democracy versus communism. In contrast to other theorists in education who have tended to privilege certain conceptual positions in these debates to address a wide range of educational issues, the author argues that these tensions should be read selectively and generatively for linking political questions concerning democracy to educational transformation. In conclusion, the article calls for a language of insurrectional democracy that integrates aspects of each approach and where strategic engagements with, and creative lines of flight out of, public institutions and the State play a role in reimagining a common education for a democratic society to come.									0	0	0	0	0	1750-8487		WOS:000337243200003		
J	Clarke, Matthew								Dialectics and dilemmas: psychosocial dimensions of ability grouping policy								CRITICAL STUDIES IN EDUCATION				55	2			186	200		10.1080/17508487.2014.891146			2014	2014	Ability grouping in schools and classrooms constitutes something of a policy hiatus in the Australian context, in contrast to the conspicuous visibility of equity and quality as explicit policy goals. This article examines what I am calling the dialectics - i.e. moments of negation that allow for creation - and dilemmas inhering in the complex and contradictory relationship between policy priorities of quality and equity, and practices of ability grouping, in Australian schooling. I explore these dialectics and dilemmas between these dimensions both at a macro, social level of policy and at a micro, psychological level of the teacher as a policy worker, exploring the latter through a vignette of one pre-service teacher grappling with issues of ability grouping in schools and classrooms. The article concludes with an argument for the value of generating continual dialectical exchange between the conscious and the unconscious, between the imaginary and symbolic registers, between psychotherapeutic and educational discourses and between policy and practice, as an essential element in ongoing formation of ethically and politically agentive teacher identities that are capable of holding policy to account in a climate that often positions teachers as educational technicians and curricular transmitters.									0	0	0	0	0	1750-8487		WOS:000337243200007		
J	Grove, Kevin								Agency, affect, and the immunological politics of disaster resilience								ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY & SPACE				32	2			240	256		10.1068/d4813			2014	2014	Resilience has become a foundational component within disaster management policy frameworks concerned with building 'cultures of safety' among vulnerable populations. These attempts at social engineering are justified through a discourse of agency and empowerment, in which resilience programming is said to enable marginalized groups to become self-sufficient and manage their own vulnerabilities. This paper seeks to destabilize this political imaginary through a critical analysis of participatory disaster resilience programming in Jamaica. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted with Jamaica's national disaster management agency, I argue that resilience operates through an affective economy of fear, hope, and confidence that enacts an immunitary biopolitics. The object of this biopolitics is excess adaptive capacity that results from affective relations between participants and their socioecological milieu. Participatory techniques such as transect walks, focus groups, and education programs attempt to encode and manipulate these affective relations in order to construct an artificial and depoliticized form of adaptive capacity that does not threaten neoliberal order. Recognizing the immunological logic at the heart of disaster resilience opens up new ethical and political imperatives in disaster management that value adaptive capacity as the vital force of new socioecological futures, rather than as an object of governmental intervention and control.									2	0	0	0	2	0263-7758		WOS:000337354800005

Focussing on the feeling of vintage', I specifically examine symbols, icons and aesthetics used in projects to queer femininity that invoke the 1950s'. Grounded in femme-inist multi-sited ethnographic research in a movement to which I also belong, I draw on interviews and participant observation in queer subcultural spaces and analyse two examples of vintage' iconography within contemporary femme organizing where vintage' is a form of archival activism that also relates to a broader cultural imaginary of racialized femininity. Then I turn to an example of queer performance where vintage' is used as a critique of imperialism and whiteness. In closing, I discuss how the feeling of vintage' relates to whiteness and to a form of imperialist nostalgia.									0	0	0	0	0	0966-369X		WOS:000337601000006

We draw on Massumi's metaphor of the grid,' which sediments ways of seeing self and other and logics for action and interaction. The grid incites imaginaries of time as active and space as passive, which evoke past, present, and future, offering coordinates for locating identities. Focusing on spatiotemporality, we conduct a discourse analysis of interviews with two Chilean lesbian-feminist activists, focusing on (1) overtly spatial and temporal dimensions (nation, region, history), (2) the constitution of lesbian space and identity (identity, visibility, consciousness, and community), and (3) oppositional entities that stabilize lesbian identity and space (men, gay men, feminists, universities, and queer). We demonstrate how the activists' imagining of Chile as a space with a linear history with a fixed past and present directs their actions to a particular future of pre-given positions. Nonetheless, we point to moments of disidentificatory movement that returns analytic attention to process, creation, and the open potentiality of movement. The politics of spatiotemporal imaginaries offers activists, geographers, and queer theorists ways of narrating sexualized subjects and politics that are not repetitive of identitarian debates, history as necessary sequence, or spaces as material.									0	0	0	0	0	0966-369X		WOS:000337685300008

An overwhelming majority of maize farmers in this region, as well as in the country more broadly, continue to cultivate locally adapted maize varieties they have bred themselves - criollo maize is the vernacular term - despite decades of concerted government attempts to effect the widespread adoption of commercially bred and licensed hybrid varieties. This state effort to restructure agricultural systems and food security according to nationalist and capitalist priorities is one tactic in a long and violent struggle for control over peasant land and labour in Mexico. By integrating feminist scholarship in geopolitics and in political ecology, I am following the lead of geographers who regard the materialities of everyday life as a foundation for political tensions and conflicts that are constantly unfolding along intersecting lines of difference. Though geopolitics has rarely turned its attention directly to theories of intimate socio-ecological relations, I argue that the field has much analytical and political leverage to gain by engaging with political ecology, and that feminist geographic imaginaries provide a crucial space in which to do so. This approach allows for an analysis of how a dominant geopolitics of land and agriculture is being undermined through the routine production of criollo maize, revealing new potential for creating broad political alliances with social movements that are currently working toward alternative visions of agriculture and food security.									0	0	0	0	0	1465-0045		WOS:000337612700008

Each token of the genre, however, takes on local accents-especially in terms of the nature of sin and salvation-that illuminate anxieties particular to the sociohistorical context in which they are told. I analyze one young Kenyan man's narrative to suggest that mobilizing the genre appropriately and effectively is a key part of the process of Christian salvation. I show how a close linguistic analysis of narrative with attention to its form as well as its content offers unique insight into the ways born-again Christians make themselves recognizable as such as well as the ways they manage the ever-present tensions between continuity and rupture in Christian spiritual rebirth.									0	0	0	0	0	0022-4200		WOS:000337642700005

By conceptualising Chinese cyber-activism as 'walled' activism, this article describes an invisible yet effective 'wall' constructed through hegemonic affective conditioning to separate those who are within the 'wall' from those on the outside. This 'wall' shields particular types of moral sensibilities, political consciousness and cultural discourse and conditions the ways in which Chinese citizens envision the possibility of engaging in public movements both online and offline, in China and elsewhere. This article argues that while it is possible to forge an 'insurgent' Chinese transnational civil sphere that remakes urban public spaces, this sphere operates largely within the 'walls' of a hegemonic nationalist agenda that promotes China's 'rise' and fends off imaginary enemies, not by the force of an oppressive regime but by the agency and free will of individuals.									2	0	0	0	2	1474-6743		WOS:000338708600008

J	Chung, Hyeyurn								“Historical Deafness” in Sherman Alexie’s Flight								American Fiction Studies	미국소설			21	1			175	194					2014	2014	By giving nod to postmodernist Kurt Vonnegut in his epigraph of Flight (2007), Sherman Alexie advertises from the get-go a postmodern bent to his novel. One identifiable marker of postmodern thought, according to Frederic Jameson, is “historical deafness”; history is no longer of any value to a postmodern protagonist who denies its relevance and instead preoccupies himself with the present and the now. Consequently, Alexie’s referencing of Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five (1969) seemingly foregrounds the significance of ahistoricity. And yet, Flight is a text in which history, be it real or imaginary, cannot be so easily elided. In fact, protagonist Zits’ finding and claiming of his “real” self Michael is contingent on his “flights” back to and reconnection with the collective history of Native Americans as well as that of all Americans. The ending of Flight is ostensibly a happy one; Zits finds himself finally unfettered from self-hatred and is embraced by a wholesome All-American family (with Officer Dave, Firefighter Robert, and Nurse Mary) that promises him baseball games, acne-free skin, healthy food choices, and stability. Still, Vonnegut’s epigraph (“Po-tee-weet?”), arguably inserted to symbolize the meaninglessness of everything that’s been said, reverberates ominously throughout the novel and undercuts the optimism that the ending suggests. One may invariably ask: is the happy ending of Flight effected by Zits ultimately choosing to turn a deaf ear to history and to focus instead on the here and the now? Certainly, Zits gaining access to the American mainstream (via his newfound family) can be read as a positive move and perhaps an expected closing with Flight’s bildungsroman format. Nonetheless, I aim to interrogate if Native American narrative is yet again placed in the danger of being erased, distorted, and re-appropriated by the dominant discourse as Zits transforms into Michael and moves rather facilely from the periphery to the center and how Flight’s take on history is implicated in this problematic process.									0	0	0	0	0	1738-5784		KJD:ART001852621

Based on a series of interviews and focus groups conducted in four sites (Istanbul, Ankara, Diyarbakir, and Sanliurfa), the concept of imaginative geographies of green is offered to highlight social and spatial differences as central to the articulation of green visions and movements. The research foregrounds several social and spatial gradients specific to the Turkish context, including east-west divides both within and beyond Turkey (i.e., Kurdish-Turkish and eastern-western Turkey, as well as notions of Turkishness and Europeanness). The work also suggests that environmental imaginaries have deeply emotional, ambivalent, and power-laden associations. Apart from the implications of the work for enriched understandings of emergent environmental possibilities in this context, the conclusion touches on ramifications for European Union accession debates as well as new directions for work on environmental citizenship and movements in the global south.									0	0	0	0	0	0004-5608		WOS:000338989200006		
J	Lee, Moonjung								Aesthetics of creation and destruction in sculpture of Marc Quinn			마크 퀸의 조각에 나타난 생성과 소멸의 미학					Bulletin of Korean Society of Basic Design & Art	기초조형학연구			15	2			415	427					2014	2014	In the art works after postmodernism deal with issues such as the body and death of human, collapse of the traditional values of beauty and acquisition of pluralism as main issues. Marc Quinn uses preposterous materials such as human blood, placenta, cloned DNA, blood and flesh of animals and living plants and completes them into a form of traditional sculpture. Through this, he expands the paradigm of arts and philosophy. Even in the aspect of themes, Quinn focuses on showing non-absoluteness of exclusive dichotomy by studying ambivalent properties of creation and extinction through body. In this paper, we analyzed these characteristics showing in Marc Quinn’s sculptures and his sculptures to find the aesthetic significances on the basis of the theory of postmodernism on the body and corporeality, dream and subconscious and the psychoanalysis on the formation process of the subject. In the series of frozen portraits and frozen gardens, he smashes the conflictory myth of life and death and tries to reinterpret vanitas paintings from a modern viewpoint. The sculpture of torso reveals human’s duplicity on the death of a human and that of other creatures. On the other hand, the sculpture of body made of the mixture of chemicals and polymer wax reveals an attitude accepting the life and death at the same time. Then this continues to the work to acquire the freedom through the imaginary and completes the quest of truth about the world and whole existence. Up to the period of modernism, human has existed in the dualistic world and has understood everything oppositively. The attempts by the artists of the same period to dissolve these conflictory structure dismantle dichotomous conflict and discrimination, embrace various existences and sublimate a view of the world at the postmodernism period which emphasizes the discussion of coexistence artistically.				포스트모더니즘(postmodernism) 이후의 미술에서는 인간의 육체성과 죽음, 미에 대한 전통적인 가치의 붕괴, 다원성의 획득 등이 주요 쟁점으로 다루어지고 있다. 마크 퀸(Marc Quinn)은 인간의 혈액, 태반, 복제 DNA, 동물의 혈액과 살(flesh), 살아있는 식물 등의 파격적인 재료를 전통적인 조각의 형식으로 완성시켜 예술과 철학의 패러다임을 확장시킨다. 퀸은 주제적인 면에서도 몸을 통해 생성과 소멸이라는 양가적 속성을 탐구함으로써 배타적 이분법의 비(非)절대성을 드러내는 데에 집중한다. 본 논문은 마크 퀸의 조각에 나타난 이러한 특성들을 분석하고 그 미학적 의의를 찾기 위해 몸과 육체성에 관한 포스트모더니즘 이론, 꿈과 무의식에 대한 정신분석학을 바탕으로 그의 조각 작품들을 분석하였다. 퀸은 냉동 초상과 냉동 정원 시리즈에서 삶과 죽음의 대립적 신화를 깨뜨리고 바니타스(vanitas) 회화의 현대적 재해석을 시도한다. 토르소(torso) 조각은 인간의 죽음과 다른 생명체의 죽음에 대한 인간의 이중성을 폭로한다. 한편 화학적 약품과 고분자 왁스(polymer wax)를 섞어 제작한 인체상은 삶과 죽음을 동시에 긍정하는 태도를 드러낸다. 그리고 이것은 상상계(the imaginary)를 통해 자유를 획득하는 작업으로 이어져 세계와 전(全) 존재에 대한 진리의 탐구를 완성시킨다. 모더니즘(modernism) 시기까지 인간은 이원론적 세계 속에 존재해 왔고 모든 것을 대립적으로 이해해왔다. 이러한 대립 구도를 해체하는 퀸과 같은 동시대 미술가들의 시도들은 다양한 존재를 포용하고 공존의 담론을 예술적으로 승화시킨다.					0	0	0	0	0	1598-8635		KJD:ART001874732		
J	김재룡								Understanding Lacan's Psychology through the Mathematical Concepts and its Application			수학적 개념을 통한 라깡의 심리학에 대한 이해와 그 응용					Communications of Mathematical Education	수학교육 논문집			28	1			45	55					2014	2014	Lacan gives an explanation on our real actual world by the concepts the "Real", the "Imaginary" and the "Symbolic". Although this three registers are not far from each other, they never can be unified. Among animals, only human has interest in the "truth". The concept of truth is discussed and debated in several contexts, including philosophy and religion. Many human activities depend upon the concept, which is assumed rather than a subject of discussion, including science, law, and everyday life. Language and words are a means by which humans convey information to one another, and the method used to determine what is a "truth" is termed a criterion of truth. Accepting then that "language is the basic social institution in the sense that all others presuppose language", Lacan found in Ferdinand de Saussure's linguistic division of the verbal sign between signifier and signified a new key to the Freudian understanding that "his therapeutic method was 'a talking cure'". The purpose of this paper is to understand Lacan's psychology and psychoanalysis by using the mathematical concepts and mathematical models, especially geometrical and topological models. And re-explanation of the symbolic model and symbols can help students understand new ideas and concepts in the educational scene.				인간의 경험은 지식의 원천이다. 우리는 지식의 원천에 관심을 가질 뿐만 아니라 그것이 사람에서 사람으로, 세대에서 세대로 전달되는 방법에도 관심을 갖는다. 한 가지 사항은 분명하다. 즉, 경험은 경험으로 전달 할 수 없으므로 먼저 “어떤 다른 것 ”으로 번역 되어야 한다는 점이다. 전달되는 것은 바로 그 “어떤 다른 것”이다. 그것이 “접수될” 때도 경험과 닮은 어떤 것으로 재번역 된다. 라깡(Lacan)은 우리가 경험하는 현실을 상상계, 상징계, 실재계로 설명한다. 라캉은 1953년에 유명한 논문 「정신분석에서 말과 언어의 기능과 장」을 발표하는데, 라캉은 정신분석이 말하는 주체에 관한 학문임을 역설하면서 주체의 원인이자 실질적 체계가 되는 상징계의 중요성을 강조한다. 사실 수학적 체계는 거의 모든 내용이 상징으로 구성되어 있다. 라깡이 대수학과 더불어 위상학을 도입하는 이유는 정신분석이론이 과학에 걸 맞는 형식화를 동경해야 한다는 것이었고, 따라서 그는 정신분석을 형식화하려는 노력을 해왔다. 본 논문은 기하학적 모델이나 위상공간과 같은 수학적 모델 및 수학적 개념이 어떻게 라깡의 심리학과 정신분석에 대한 이해를 도울 수 있는지를 알아보고자 한다. 또한, 그 응용으로서 인문학적 상상력을 동원하여 상징들을 재번역 함으로써 학생들에게 다양한 사고의 능력을 키워줄 수 있음에 대해 이야기 하고자한다.					0	0	0	0	0	1226-6663		KJD:ART001849452		
J	박정필								“A Dissociated Abundance of Being”: The Potential of Rhetoric and the Impossibility of Rhetoric in Wallace Stevens’s The Auroras of Autumn								Journal of American Studies	미국학 논집			46	1			333	355					2014	2014	The Auroras of Autumn explores the significance of the rhetorical effects or functions, which provide a best shelter, as the pressure of reality such as boreal winter builds up. On the other hand, Stevens does not ignore the fact that the rhetorical world, though achieving the sublime itself, should receive a rude insult from within. In addition, the grim reality, which was vanquished by rhetoric, again leads the fictive ideal to danger. The way that Stevens finds a shelter from the reality is to seek a rhetorical world, or the “search for the center of the self.” The introduction of rhetorical mechanism begins the use of analogy, gradually expanding the detachment functions in the rhetoric. Thus, owing to the doubling of the reality, at its first stage, the imaginary world as the replica of the reality does not differ substantially from the exterior existence. But over time, by adopting more diverse rhetorical strategies, the imitated realm locates its own routes, becomes increasingly independent of the other world, and confirms its full autonomy, which includes the supreme fiction. As if no longer afflicted with and penetrated by the reality, the detached rhetoric eventually establishes the perfect ideal, the permanent art, relishing the highest wealth and beauty, and even creating spiritual atmosphere. However, strangely enough, the differentiating technique of the rhetoric engenders self-contradictory phenomenon. The sublime world of rhetoric suffers self-defamation and contacts with obscurity and vacuity, due to its own mechanism of modification and abstraction. In addition, the rhetoric experiences its impossibility again by the uncanny return of the repressed reality, which was already defeated. After the fictive application undeniably trounces the external pressure, the hidden dark reality abruptly surfaces and incites tensions around the fictional frameworks, even deterring the use of any small imaginary forces.									0	0	0	0	0	1226-3753		KJD:ART001879861

The exhibition also includes hand drawing animations in Unity 3D using the Qualcom AR SDK, which are viewable on Android smart phones. I think that the adaptation of augmented reality (AR) technology can be a solution for the temporal and spatial limitations of colorless cubical spaces in galleries and museums. In AR Art and Imaginary Spaces, I explore the space of mixed reality with an artist’s imagination. In order to improve unique and immersive user experiences and active interactions, I want to present imaginary spaces and enable viewers to imagine their own spaces. I believe that by using AR technology, I will be able to lead the viewers into their own imagined worlds by sharing the messages and memories contained in my artwork.									0	0	0	0	0	2092-7045		KJD:ART001881607

To do this, 5th graders (N=107) were selected from 1 elementary school in Gangwon province and were administered the questionnaires. Some of them were also interviewed deeply. The analyses of the results indicated that most students drew science imaginary pictures in ‘land’ or ‘universe’ of ‘future’ than non-science imaginary pictures. In the academic field, ‘machine’ was most frequently included in their pictures, and ‘earth science’ or ‘building and traffic’ was also frequently included. In addition, half of the pictures included two or more fields. Many students perceived positively the educational benefits of science imaginary drawing upon cognitive, affective, and aesthetic aspects. However, they also had several difficulties in the processes of scientific imaginary drawing such as ‘difficulties in using artistic skills’, ‘difficulties in selecting the subject’, ‘difficulties in imagining’, and ‘difficulties in expressing my thoughts to pictures’. Educational implications of these findings are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	1598-3099		KJD:ART001856082		
J	Jin, Jae Kyo								Se-Jung Wang in the Cultural Spacein late Joseon Dynasty			조선조 후기 文藝 공간에서의 王世貞					Journal of Korean literature in Hanmun	한국한문학연구			54				139	171					2014	2014	As this study paid attention to the fact that a lot of writers in the late Joseon Dynasty perused Se-Jung Wang’s books, this paper intended to determine what the many writers’ interests in Se-Jung Wang’s books meant in the cultural history. The writers of that time evaluated the literary works remained by Se-Jung Wang including ‘Seven People’ in various ways. Some writers regarded their literary works as the imitation of ancient style such as the Qin and Han’s styles and the Tang’s style. Some of them criticised their literary works harshly because they understood that these works copied the ancient style and even plagiarize them. Even others highly commented their works and their creative abilities. The popularity of the literary works written by Se-Jung Wang in late Joseon Dynasty was not a temporary blip and for a long time, the writers of that time expressed the drastic opinions such as affirmative verse denial, criticizing harshly verse praising, etc. As this paper examined the literary works remained by Se-Jung Wang and the arguments in late Joseon Dynasty, this paper proposed that the argument of the literary works of Se-Jung Wang in Joseon Dynasty was an cultural issue over the national level and in the long run, East Asian society could work an imaginary cultural republic over space and time.				이 논문은 조선조 후기 문인들이 다양한 관점에서 왕세정의 글을 열독한 사실을 주목하고, 그것의 문화사적 의미를 밝히고자 한 것이다. 당대 문인들은 문예 公論 場에서 ‘七子’를 비롯하여 王世貞이 남긴 글을 秦漢과 盛唐의 의고로 바라보거나, 模擬와 模倣 혹은 剽竊로 이해하여 비난하는가 하면, 일부에서는 그들의 창작 능력과 작품을 고평하는 등 다양한 방식으로 이해하였다. 조선조 후기 왕세정 열풍은 단기간에 그치지 않았고, 오랜 기간에 걸쳐 비판과 반 비판, 긍정과 부정 등의 극단적 시선으로 표출되었다. 이처럼 왕세정이 남긴 다양한 흔적을 탐색하고, 그 자체가 일국을 넘어선 문예적 이슈라는 인식을 제시하였고, 결국 이러한 현상은 동아시아에서 시공간을 넘어 상상의 문예 공화국으로도 기능하였음을 밝혔다.					0	0	0	0	0	1228-128X		KJD:ART001883644		
J	AHMED, NAGWA KHALAF KHODIRI								Awlad Haretna between Religious Intertextuality and Folk			أولاد حرتنا بين التناص الديني والتناص الشعبي					Journal of Middle Eastern Affairs	중동문제연구			13	2			253	294					2014	2014	AwladHaretna (Children of Gebelawi, Children of the Alley), (أولاد حرتنا ) is a novel by the Egyptian writer and Nobel laureate Naguib Mahfouz. It was originally published in Arabic in 1959, in serialised form in the daily newspaper Al-Ahram. It met with severe opposition from religious authorities, and publication in the form of a book was banned in Egypt. It was first printed in Lebanon in 1967. Gabalawi being an allegory for religion in general, the first four sections retell, in succession, the stories of: Adam (Adham أدهم) how he was favored by Gabalawi over the latter's other sons, including Satan/Iblis(Idrisإدريس); Moses (Gabal جبل); Jesus (Rifa'a رفاعة); and Muhammad(Qasim قاسم). Families of each son settle in different parts of the alley, symbolising Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The protagonist of the book's fifth section is Arafa (عرفة), who symbolizes modern science and, significantly, comes after all prophets, while all of the prophets’ followers claim Arafa as one of their own. The story recreates the interwoven history of the three monotheistic Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), allegorized through the setting of an imaginary 19th century Cairene neighborhood. Mahfouz’s novel demonstrates the technique of intertextuality, which is the shaping of a text's meaning by another text, such as when an author borrows and transforms a prior text, or when a reader references one text in reading another. The term “intertextuality” has been borrowed and transformed many times since it was coined by poststructuralist Julia Kristeva in 1966. If one examines Mahfouz’s novel in depth, one can see two trajectories: the first is due to the stories of the Prophets, and the second is due to the popularity of Egyptian life.The first type can be called folk intertextuality, and the second type can be called religious intertextuality. Through data from statistical linguistics, we can observe that folk intertextuality occupies an area larger than the religious intertextuality. This confirms that the aim of Mahfouz is to problematize aspects of the Egyptian Alley and not to offend the prophets of God.									0	0	0	0	0	1598-3633		KJD:ART001887216		
J	min, choi jae								Writing Early Modern London: A study on the spatial negotiation of Whitney’s Sweet Nosegay and other London Poems								Journal of Milton Studies in Korea	밀턴과 근세영문학			24	1			45	67					2014	2014	This paper examines the sociopolitical circumstances preconditioning Isabella Whitney's Sweet Nosegay, especially in the context of spatial restrictions on Renaissance women, and discusses the ways in which Whitney subverts such restrictions on her through a literal and imaginary excursion into London civic space. In oder to illustrate Whitney's extraordinary mobility and copious knowledge of London, this paper also devotes much of its pages to a critical comparison between “Her Will to London,” Whitney's major poetic achievement in Sweet Nosegay, and other contemporary (male) humanists' poetic works. This comparison has made it clear that Whitney embraces London and its everyday commercial activities as they are, without false presumptions and without subordinating them to “nobler” aesthetic judgement or moral values, unlike what Ben Jonson and John Denham did in their London poems.									0	0	0	0	0	1738-2556		KJD:ART001880569

In order to provide with special experiences to them, the ways to produce space get diversified. The small 'Concept Stores' try to provide with their own unique experiences, competing super brand stores. Therefore, the expressions of Depaysement from Surrealism leads us to particular experiences as a way of creating and provoking imagines and special experiences. It refers to differentiated sensitive spaces. (Method)Therefore, in this study, we are going to deliberate how to apply 'Depaysement' to 'Concept Stores', sensitive space felt by senses and recognition, and connection between 'Depaysement' methods and sensitive spaces. (Result)The Depaysement methods which are based on 'Strangeness' are produced and expressed in diverse ways in the space of 'Concept Store'. Through this, modern people may experience something new rather than daily routine. As a result, 'Concept Space' through 'Depaysement' which is imaginary and sensitive space can create differentiated its own image.

J	Kim,, Su-Jung								A Study on Historical Consciousness and Literary Imagination of <Yuguwangsejaoejeon>			<유구왕세자외전>의 역사의식과 문학적 상상력*					Korean Language & Literature	한국언어문학			88				81	100					2014	2014	A Study on Historical Consciousness and Literary Imagination of <Yuguwangsejaoejeon> Kim, Su-jung Kim Ryeo took the basis of <Yuguwangsejaoejeon>, a story about Crown Prince Yugu, from folk tales and transmissions. Around 200 years ago, a party with crown prince Yugu drifted ashore on Jeju Island, and officials including a Jeju minister killed the crown prince and hundreds of foreigners to plunder precious treasure from the ship. So, a rumor that Yugu Country would cross the sea for revenge spread. Folk records such as <Taekriji> recorded the plunder based on the transmitted record. Kim Ryeo reflected the history based on the written record and expressed the future-oriented hope to revive the relationship with Yugu Country in his book. However, according to <Joseon Silrok>, an official national record, the government tended to conceal the attack to the Yugu people, showing a vague attitude toward it. When political change happened, they would approach it according to the situations of the officers. The Jeju minister, who was the person concerned, was appointed to a higher position. Kim Ryeo disclosed the minister's wrongdoing specifically and criticized the corrupted power the evil people enjoyed. His historical consciousness was dramatically delivered to readers through his literary imagination. He made fantastic lists of treasures officers were fascinated with and increased indignation and pathos by describing that the crown prince wrote a poem of death with his blood. He weakened the logic the Jeju minister excused himself with by changing his real name and showed that an evil person with an imaginary name can be the subject of harsh judgement. As well, feeling sorry about the position of Yugu Country which could not obtain revenge as it is a small country, he cast a sad question on what could be done if they would cross the sea on a battleship. Kim Ryeo's literary mind based on stern historical lessons and understanding of the common people raised the problems consciousness in this work.				.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-1730		KJD:ART001861375

I protagonisti entrano in Real dall'azione di Objet petit a, ma la loro categoria e il risultato finale sono tutti diversi. Silvia e Pia cominciano da Symbolic e muovono a Real e poi rientrano in Symbolic dell'ordine sociale, universale e generale. Angelo e soddisfatto nel mondo del suo narcisismo ed e isolato in Imaginary e poi in fine e assassinato da Agata. Agata, sognando la durata di Real che vuole mantenere il mondo del piacere, e ossessionata dalla pulsione di morte. L'uccisione di Angelo significa la morte simbolica di Agata, perche lei rifiuta il ritorno o l'armonia in Symbolic, al di sopra della legge sociale o della categoria morale. In quest'opera appare la sovrapposizione delle immagini ambivalenti di capro espiatorio e perpetratore vissute da tutti i protagonisti. Angelo non e solo il salvatore che soddisfa temporaneamente la passione delle tre donne, ma anche perpetratore che le sacrifica trattandole soltanto come oggetti ideali di soddisfazione della sua passione. Inoltre egli ha contemporaneamente l'immagine di capro espiatorio essendo ucciso dalle donne. Al contrario le tre donne hanno l'immagine di capro espiatorio perche sono soltanto oggetto sessuale, ma hanno anche l'immagine di perpetratore per l'uccisione di Angelo.									0	0	0	0	0	1598-5598		KJD:ART001872840		
J	김상석								Re-reading The Quiet American from the Perspective of Post- Colonialism			그린 다시읽기: 조용한 미국인 을 중심으로					Modern Studies in English Language and Literature	현대영어영문학			58	1			65	91					2014	2014	The purpose of this thesis is to re-examine Graham Greene's The Quiet American from the perspective of Post-colonialism. This thesis will address West's imperialism over the East, racism against orientals and sexism which produces another relationship of domination and subordination between men and women. In particular, this thesis discusses imperialism in the context of sexism in that the colonized East is analogous to the passive and inferior position of women in relation to the dominance of Western men over women and of Western men over the East. The Quiet American illustrates the binary opposition of 'West' and 'non-West' which establishes the Western subject as central and the indigene as Other. This view is illustrated in two specific ways: from the depiction of an imaginary world called 'Greeneland' and from the depiction of indigenous people of Viet Nam along with 'Third Force' which will undermine colonialism, destroy communism and liberate Viet Nam. The novel also captures and represents problems and conflicts of race, class and gender. Re-examining The Quiet American from the post-colonial perspective illuminates Greene's technique of revealing the imperialistic mentality.									0	0	0	0	0	1738-7620		KJD:ART001853981		
J	van der Horst, Dan								Landscapes of lost energy: counterfactual geographical imaginary for a more sustainable society								MORAVIAN GEOGRAPHICAL REPORTS				22	2			66	72					2014	2014	The quest for sustainable energy, one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century, calls for more input from academics than 'simply' producing good science. Geographical imaginations are as old as storytelling and mapmaking, but this essay is neither about 'long ago and far away', nor about utopian energy futures. This is a call to geographers to engage with 'alternative present' energy scenarios, using the full range of analytical and discursive tools at our disposal. Drawing on a diverse tradition of imagined spaces and the awareness of absences (material, relational or otherwise), geographers should be able to contribute to the quest for a more sustainable society by assessing, envisaging, and communicating a counterfactual 'here and now', based on good practices existing right now, but not (yet) right here. We need to understand how much more sustainable our bit of the planet would be if we could just, environmentally speaking, 'keep up' with the best of our neighbours. This counterfactual present should be seen as neither radical nor utopian, because it only assumes the historic adoption of best practices which we now know to be feasible and successful. And if this alternative current scenario looks radically different from the 'real' state we are in, then this goes to show how radically unsustainable our business-as-usual approach has been.									0	0	0	0	0	1210-8812		WOS:000338931100008		
J	SOU, MOUN JEAN								The Critical Discussion about Lacanian Structural Definition of Sexual Difference			남녀성차에 대한 라캉의 구조적 정의와 그 문제					Philosophia , Journal of Korean Philosophical Society	철학연구			129				53	82					2014	2014	This paper analyzes the concept of Lacanian subject and the structural definition of sexual difference between man and woman, and criticizes some problems of those definitions. It seems to me, to do so, that it is important to know precisely the core terms of psychoanalysis quoted by Lacan. We should analyze the basic meanings and the relation of the Imaginary, Symbolic and the Real, of ideal ego and ego ideal, of phallus and signifier, of desire and the other, of consciousness and unconsciousness, of alienation and separation, etc. I'm going to discuss the relation between the Imaginary and the ideal ego in chapter 2, and then, deal with the relation between the Symbolic and the ego ideal in chapter 3. I'll explain both similarity and difference between the ideal ego and ego ideal through those discussions. In chapter 4, I'm planning to explain the relation among the other, desire and the subject of unconsciousness. In chapter 5, I'll analyze the meaning of phallus and signifier. I'll criticize the Lacanian structural definition of sexual difference on the basis of the work made in former chapters. These discussions will lead to my final conclusion that the concept of Lacanian subject and the structural definition of sexual difference are only dependent on reductionism regarding everything as symbolic, which has in itself a lot of contradiction. In order that All discussions about sexual difference have at least a objective meaning, they have to rely on anatomical differences between man and woman.				본 글은 라캉의 주체 개념 및 이것의 연장인 남녀성차에 대한 구조적 정의에 대한 내용을 분석하고 이러한 정의들에 내포된 문제들을 비판한다. 라캉이 제공하는 남녀성차에 대한 구조적 정의를 분석하고 비판하기 위해서는 우선 그가 이론화하고 개념화한 저 다양한 정신분석학적 용어들, 즉 상상계, 상징계 그리고 실재계의 관계성, 이상적 자아와 자아 이상의 구분, 남근과 기표의 의미, 타자와 욕망, 의식과 무의식, 소외와 분리 등과 같은 기본적인 용어들의 사용법을 분석하는 것이 급선무이다. 이를 위해 필자는 우선 제 2장에서 상상계와 이상적 자아 사이의 관계, 그리고 제 3장에서는 상징계와 자아 이상 사이의 관계를 논구할 것이다. 그렇게 하여 ‘이상적 자아’와 ‘자아 이상’의 차이와 유사를 해명할 것이다. 그리고 제 4장에서 타자, 욕망 그리고 무의식적 주체 사이의 연관성을 해명하고, 제 5장에서는 라캉이 말하는 남근과 기표의 의미를 분석할 것이다. 그리고 제 6-7장에서는 상기의 분석들을 토대로 남녀성차에 대한 라캉의 구조적 정의를 본격적으로 분석할 것이다. 그리고 마지막 결론 장에서는 주체 이론 및 남녀성차에 대한 라캉이론의 전체적 의의 및 그 한계를 최종적으로 정리할 것이다. 그런데, 물론 결론의 장에서 성차에 대한 라캉의 구조적 정의를 전체적으로 비판하기 이전에 각 장들의 말미에서 그 장의 핵심적인 관념들을 비판하는 책무를 소홀히 하지 않을 것이다. 필자의 최종 결론은 이것이다. 라캉과 라캉 학파의 성차에 대한 다양한 정의들이 최소한의 객관적인 의미라도 가지려고 한다면, 그것들은 궁극적으로 해부학적 차이에 근거해야만 한다는 것이다.					0	0	0	0	0	1226-9727		KJD:ART001851589		
J	ShinEunKyung								Power of dance imaginary expression learning as nonverbal communication			비언어적 커뮤니케이션으로서 무용 상상표현 학습의 힘					Resach of Dance Education	한국무용교육학회지			25	2			1	16					2014	2014	Expanding autonomy and imagination of students become a crucial concept in dance education. In the centre of every class, which puts emphasis on various technique, free idea and boundless imagination, expects the result of individuality and originality at all time. The aim of this study is to propose the power of imaginary expression learning and the appropriateness in activity of education specifically in this period of attempting harmonic development of emotion and reason as well as right brain and left brain. Therefore, it examines the core notion and signification of dance and suggests the evidence of the power of nonverbal communication. Furthermore, it explains the point of awareness, emotion, and capacity of kinetic sense, which all become a thinking method in dance, and reconfirms the position and the core notion of dance in the present age contemplating the range of the dance imaginary expression learning in dance as arts. Consequently, dance imaginary expression learning embarks on the idea of creative inspiration to be accomplished critical thinking through sensitive language, thinking language and the process of action. It is essential for the field of Performing Arts, Liberal Arts and Applied Arts and the effectiveness and its value are:Firstly, imaginary expression is achieved through the experience universe as reflection of various experience. It goes through gradual stage of development and finally overcomes one’s limitation. Secondly, imaginary expression is further encouraged by on the basis of the symbolic function, which includes both verbal and nonverbal, and progresses from its systematisation and organisation. Thirdly, imaginary expression as the means of nonverbal communication promotes the development of brain and thinking language, declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge and sense and critical thinking. Therefore, as reason is assigned flexibility, energy, and vitality, students have a liberal mind. This study promotes the understanding of effective transition of both connection and execution of one’s imagination and expression in dance class.									0	0	0	0	0	1229-3547		KJD:ART001882310		
J	김정은								Study on the expressional characteristics of dance creation-based on subjectivity of desire-			무용의 표현성 연구-욕망의 주체성을 중심으로-					Resach of Dance Education	한국무용교육학회지			25	1			97	109					2014	2014	This study aimed to suggest the self expressions on the subject's inner world by exploring the expressional characteristics of dance creation expressing the unconscious world which is buried in the human's subconsciousness beyond the consciousness on the basis of Jacques Lacan's Desire Theory. Art can subline the theory esthetically, and especially the dance art is a passage connecting the consciousness and the unconsciousness, so can form the sympathy toward potential desires through their specific visualization. As one way for establishing the identity, Lacan's theory provides a clue to find a positive union point about the subject of desires. Also, the understanding and interpretation about Lacan's theory showing the human's inner essence can be considered as the function as a slice showing the cycle of potential desires buried in the unconsciousness. Therefore, as the expressional characteristics of dance creation of this study suggest, metonymy through repetition is a cause and result simultaneously which leads a work. For this study accepted the Imaginary, the Symbolic, and the Real among mental territories in Lacan's theory in order to describe the process forming the desire's subject. After exploring the factors of subject formation appeared in the process, and then this study arranged the characteristics found in each stage into the misconception, the difference and the deviation, which were set as the foundation for analyzing the expressional characteristics of dance creation. So, this study suggested the expressional characteristics of dance creation from a creative aspect that understands the desires as human's essence and that the desires can purify and sublime desires themselves. And this study puts its meaning in that it highlighted a positive viewpoint seeing the desire as a productive thing that enriches individual's mental life. As a natural meeting between internal self and external self, the art creation provides chances to discover true appearances of each other. Especially, it can be considered the dance art contributes to transferring and integrating the human's unconsciousness area to the consciousness area. Therefore the author of this study thinks that the dance art should contribute for modern people to free from their inside, pressured and distorted self by continually seeking for new expression methods of subject. Further, the author suggests that creative approaches for created dance works and continual trials for relevant studies should obtain good results.									0	0	0	0	0	1229-3547		KJD:ART001858909		
J	김현생								Kim Man-joong’s Guunmong and Lacan’s Desire			김만중의『구운몽』과 라캉의 욕망이론					Studies in British and American Language and Literature	영미어문학			113				91	108					2014	2014	The purpose of this study is to analyze how human desires are expressed in Guunmong, Dream of Cloud Nine, with the device of Lacan’s desire. It is a dream vision novel. In the stage of Sungjin’s dream, external narrations are formed as triple structure, the real-dream-real world. The Buddhist monk, Sungjin desires worldly wealth and honor. Characteristically, his desire is realized in his dream by being reborn as Yang Soyou who is Sungjin’s Other. According to Lacan our desires are not our own, they are the Other’s. In arena of Lacan’s desire, the symbolic-real-imaginary forms a trio of intra-psychic realms. Sungjin expresses his desire in the form of a demand, but in the very process of making that demand something of the need is left out or leftover forever. Lacan calls this a residue or a margin and it is what becomes desire again. Desire, therefore, can be satisfied in the imaginary. Thus what Sungjin desires is never realized in the real world, for the real resists representation in Lacanian theory. This can be explained the reason why Sungjin’s desire is embedded only in his dream.				.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-0580		KJD:ART001883171		
J	김영덕								Albee’s Postmodern Family: Family Games and Storytelling in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?			올비의 포스트모던 가족: Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?에 나타난 가족게임과 스토리텔링					Studies in British and American Language and Literature	영미어문학			113				129	149					2014	2014	Edward Albee’s represen- tations of the theme of dysfunctional family culminate in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? which combines a realist critique of contemporary American culture and an absurdist interest in language games. In the manner of Samuel Beckett’s narrative construction of familial relations and Harold Pinter’s dramatization of male-female power struggles, Albee’s characters construct an imaginary family through family games. These games replace the bankrupt metanarrative of the middle-class family, substituting it with verbal practices in which George and Martha perform man and wife. Their storytelling is the single most impor- tant ingredient of the family games through which the couple “conceive” and “kill” their son and retell the stories of their own and their parents’ marriages. Albee’s family games constitute, contrary to the common assumption that they belong to the realm of illusion, a peculiarly postmodern entity that exists in the performative present and subverts the “truth”/“illusion” binarism.				.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-0580		KJD:ART001883173		
J	Hong, Eun-Sook								The Revisionist Western as New Mythography: Alternative Narratives in The Wild Bunch			새로운 신화기술로서의 수정주의 웨스턴: <와일드 번치>에서의 대안적 내러티브					Studies in British and American Language and Literature	영미어문학			113				151	169					2014	2014	This study searches for how the American public myth became the narrative of the western and why the genre mutated into sub-genres such as the revisionist western, after reviewing the literary process that the frontier myth became the public myth of America. The revisionist western reflects social backgrounds that the frontier myth didn’t play the role of the American public myth, which led to the crisis of American identities. All the characters in The Wild Bunch experience their own violence in their own places. Showing a wide range of violence, the mythography of the revisionist western discards the liberal progressive ideology of the frontier myth and suggests a new alternative narrative. While the mythography in the early western justifies the aggressive expansion under the cloak of civilization, that of the revisionist western questions whether the connotation and denotation of violence can be justified. Alternative narratives in the revisionist western can be applied to reflect the terror-epoch of the post 9/11 social imaginary.				.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-0580		KJD:ART001883174		
J	Young, Park Jai								A Mortal Fight with Madness: Reading Desire in Cuju			광기와의 사투  쿠조 속의 욕망 읽기					Studies in English Language & Literature	영어영문학연구			40	1			63	81					2014	2014	Park, Jai Young. “A Mortal Fight with Madness: Reading Desire in Cuju.” Studies in English Language & Literature. 40.1 (2014): 63-81. This essay attempts to construe Stephen King’s Cuju as a text of desire with various desire theories. Many thinkers have attempted to clarify the perception of desire. For example, Hegel contends that people experience various stages like “consumption” and “recognition” in order to resolve desire. Freud asserts that (sexual) desire is engendered from an uncompromising gap between “the affectionate” of childhood, who is an idealistic person that the child loves, and “the sensual,” the target of his/her physical desire. And Lacan claims that desire is substantiated in the loss of “completeness” in the chasm between the Imaginary Order and the Symbolic Order. Employing those philosophical thoughts, this essay scrutinizes the characters of Cuju and dissects the significance of their psychic changes while they are dealing with desire. It ponders on the implication of madness in relation with aberrational desire. It also explicates the historical connotation of the name Cujo and attempts to expose the substantiation of desire embedded in the myth of killer Dodd, Tad’s monster dreams, Donna’s infidelity, and the allegorization of Cujo.

J	jae-sun, Choi								A Study on the Lee, Seung-Woo‘s novels that use book as a main motif			‘책’에 관한 이승우 소설 연구					Studies of Chinese & Korean Humanities	한중인문학연구			43				57	77					2014	2014	The aim of this article is to study writer, Lee, Seoung-Woo's consciousness on the crisis of books in modern society and how he described the real conditions, which make people not to read books and awakened the value of books in his three short stories,「Book of Slaughterhouse」,「The Process of Incarnation」, and 「Sleeping with Book」. These novels deals with the destiny of books, and the lives of people who are related to books. The main topics of the novels are book, and the main characters are also people who are related to books, such as novelist, librarian, book donator, book delivery person, and readers. The writer describes severe realities that disparage book's value, and the symptom of the times that cause man not to read books. The writer uses factors of fantasy literature in order to show the situation that book's value is disregarded in this materialized and absurd society. The motives of fantasy literature that the writer, Lee, Seung-Woo mainly used in this short stories are grotesque atmosphere, dreamlike background, and expression of sexual desires. These motives allow readers, who are accustomed to realities, to grasp reality with new perspective by giving unfamiliar shock under familiar circumstances. 「Book of Slaughterhouse」 makes reader to face unrealistic accidents and experience bewilderment and hesitancy by mixing reality and imaginary. This kind of composition, which is used in fantasy literature, makes readers to face the critical situation of books with fear. The ritual ceremony that the main character conducts in the text contains ritualistic meaning-reviving book's death-and is used as an allegory that anticipates the death and revival of the book. 「The Process of Incarnation」 embodies depreciation of book's value and the symptom of society, which makes it difficult to live as novelists. The overall mood of this story is grotesque, and the behaviors of characters who express their sexual desire that evokes writer's self-deprecation and feebleness remind the crisis of reality. 「Sleeping with books」shows the problems of the times that does not look for book anymore. In text, the job of book delivery disappears and the discussions about books also disappear with the crisis of book. Reflecting the spirit of the age, the characters who are related to books meet death. However, the writer shows that this death is not the end and there is another revival by making main character to convey and pass down books to another generation. Lee, Seung-Woo describes the vulgar omens of modern society that books are considered too priceless and light through these three short stories. However, he still inspires feelings of hope that books will continuously survive after all by describing the behaviors of the characters in his novels.				이 글에서는 이승우 소설집『나는 아주 오래 살 것이다』(문이당, 2002)에 실린 세 편의 단편소설「도살장의 책」,「육화의 과정」,「책과 함께 자다」를 통해 책의 죽음과 책의 위기를 조장하는 시대 속에서 책의 부활과 책읽기의 의미, 책의 가치를 환기하고자 하는 작가 의식과 그것을 표현하는 방식을 고찰하고자 한다. 세 편의 소설은 작품의 주된 제재가 책이며, 주 인물 역시 소설가, 도서관 사서, 책 기증자, 책배달 조합원, 독자 등으로 책과 관계있는 직업인들이다. 작가는 소설과 소설 창작에 대해 이야기 하면서 책을 읽지 않는 시대적 징후와 책의 가치를 폄하하는 현실을 보여주고 있다. 물신화되고 부조리한 현대사회 속에서 책의 가치가 무시되는 상황을 보여주기 위해 작가 이승우는 환상문학의 요소를 사용하고 있다. 작가가 소설에서 주로 사용한 환상적 모티프는 그로테스크한 분위기나 몽환적 배경, 성적 욕망의 표출 같은 것이다. 이러한 모티프들은 현실에 익숙한 독자들에게 낯선 충격을 통해 현실의 상황을 문제의식을 갖고 새롭게 파악할 수 있게 한다. 「도살장의 책」은 실제적인 것과 상상적인 것을 혼융하여 독자가 비현실적인 사건에 직면하여 당황하게 하거나 그것을 어떻게 수용할지 망설이게 한다. 이러한 구성은 책의 위기를 두려움을 갖고 바라보게 한다. 소설 속에서 주인공이 행하는 제사의식은 현실적 개연성은 없지만 책의 죽음을 되살리고자 하는 제의적 의미를 지니며, 책의 죽음과 부활을 기대하는 알레고리로 사용되고 있다. 「육화의 과정」은 소설가 주인공이 겪는 소설 가치의 하락과 소설가로 살기 어려운 시대적 징후를 포착하여 형상화한다. 소설의 배경과 분위기 역시 그로테스크하고 성적 욕망을 표출하는 인물의 행위와 그것이 자아내는 소설가의 자조감과 무력함은 현실의 위기를 상기시킨다. 물신주의가 팽배한 현실 속에서 세태에 순응할 수밖에 없는 소설가의 상황과 엄숙한 작가의식 사이의 괴리를 풍자하면서 소설 쓰는 작가 의식을 돌아보게 한다. 「책과 함께 자다」는 더 이상 책을 구하지 않는 시대의 풍경을 보여준다. 책의 위기와 함께 책배달이란 직업도 소멸하고 책과 관련한 담론도 사라진다. 이러한 시대상을 반영하듯 책과 관련된 인물들은 고독한 죽음을 맞는다. 그러나 작가는 그 죽음이 끝이 아니고 다시 새로운 부활이 있음을 주 인물의 마지막 행위를 통해 암시하고 있다. 결국 어떠한 상황에서도 책의 생명은 지속되리라는 작가 의식을 보여주고 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	1598-0383		KJD:ART001884000

Wang Xiaobo accepted the Western writing technique of artistic fiction due to Eastern and Western culture shock and fusion in 1980s. However, as a Chinese writer, his writing is influenced inevitably by traditional Chinese literature which lasted thousands of years since its birth and finally evolved into one with a special spirit and traditions which is different from Western novels. Wang Xiaobo has read a lot of traditional Chinese works, including historical biography, Tang legend, mystery novels, urban fiction, comic novels and other traditional Chinese folk novels. He is particularly fond of Tang legend and has learned a lot of useful creative techniques from these novels, such as: the overall performance of his narrative style ,the rich imaginary fantasy plot, the humorous comic narrative strategy and the chivalrous spirit of the characters ---- all from the traditional Chinese novels .Thus, Wang Xiaobo’s novels are products of the interaction between Chinese and Western thoughts and are influenced by both the spirit of traditional Chinese literature and thoughts of Western literature.				당대문학분야에 있어서 왕소파(王小波)의 사상과 창작은 20세기 말과 21세기 초 중국문단의 자유주의 경향을 대표한다고 할 수 있다. 20세기 80년대에 왕소파는 서양의 소설예술기법을 받아들였으나 중문작가로서 그의 소설은 중국 전통문학의 영향을 받은 것은 불가피하다. 수천년 동안 중국 소설은 서양과 서로 다른 소설 정신과 전통을 형성해왔다. 왕소파는 중국 전통작품을 대량으로 연구하였는데 그 중에서 역사소설, 전기소설, 지괴소설, 시민소설과 희극소설 등 있었다. 그는 특히 당대의 전기소설을 좋아하기 때문에 이런 전기소설으로부터 창작기법을 많이 얻었다. 예를 들어 그의 소설에서 나타난 서사성격, 환상적인 줄거리, 유머적인 서사전략, 소설인물의 의협정신 등 모두 중국 전통소설에서 나온 것이다. 예컨대 그의 소설은 중국과 서양사상과 문학을 융합하는 것이며 중국 전통문학정신과 서양문학사상의 영향을 공동적으로 받은 산물이라고 할 수 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	1598-0383		KJD:ART001884008

Inaddition to these, he has also presented a kind of realistic visions in muchmore direct ways by Himizu(2011) or Land of Hope(2013) after 3·11 disaster. The purpose of this paper is to try a psychoanalytic interpretation of SionSono’s film, centering on his Guilty of Romance(愛のむきだし), in terms of theconcepts of Jacques Lacan(1901-1981), for example, gaze, objet petit a,fantasy, desire, the imaginary-the symbolic-the real, jouissance, etc. In sodoing, this paper will pay special attention to the discourse of love on onehand, exploring the way how to show any new perspective to the religiousstudies by reading film and religion in association with Lacan on the otherhand.				우리에게는 아직 생소한 일본의 영화감독 소노 시온(園子溫, 1961~현재)은 <자살클럽>(2001)의 대성공 이래 그 속편인 <노리코의 식탁>(2005)을 비롯하여 <기묘한 서커스>(2005) 및 ‘증오 3부작’이라 칭해지는 <사랑의 노출>(2008), <차가운 열대어>(2010), <사랑의 죄>(2011) 등 시적이고 철학적인 메시지를 수반하는 충격적이고 자극적인 폭력과독창적이고 도전적인 터치의 섹슈얼리티 묘사를 거쳐, 3·11 동일본대진재 이후 내놓은<두더쥐>(2011)와 <희망의 나라>(2013)에서는 보다 직접적인 방식으로 현실참여적인 비전을 제시하고 있다. 본고의 목적은 응시와 대상a, 환상과 욕망, 상상계-상징계-실재계, 주이상스(jouissance) 등의 라캉(Jacques Lacan, 1901-1981)적 개념들을 도구 삼아 소노 시온의 영화 가운데 <사랑의 노출>(愛のむきだし)에 대한 정신분석학적 해석을 시도하는 데에 있다. 그 과정에서 특히 사랑 담론에 주목하는 한편, 라캉으로 영화 또는 종교를 말한다는 것이 종교연구자에게 어떤 새로운 전망을 제시해 줄 수 있는지를 모색하고자 한다. 이때 다음과 같은 라캉의 세 가지 문제의식 즉 (1)오인의 구조로부터 출발하자는 제안 (2)틈새(간극, 잉여, 구멍, 공백)와 부재(결여, 결핍) 또는 실패의 적극적인 의미를수용하는 자세 (3)시각(eye, 주체가 대상을 보는 것)으로부터 응시(gaze, 대상이 주체를 보는 것)로 전환하자는 문제의식 등으로부터 적지 않은 시사를 받을 수 있으리라고 기대된다.					0	0	0	0	0	1739-0540		KJD:ART001866696		
J	조선령								A moment of destruction and creation : Janet Cardiff's <The Murder of Crows> and the sound as a ‘historical object’			파괴와 창조의 시간- 자넷 카디프(Janet Cardiff)의 <까마귀의 살해(The Murder of Crows)>와 ‘역사적 대상’으로서의 사운드					The Journal of Aesthetics and Science of Art	미학예술학연구			40				41	74					2014	2014	It is the purpose of this paper to analyze the sound installation artwork <The Murder of Crows> by contemporary artists Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller through the theory of allegory by Walter Benjamin, and thereby to illuminate an artistic possibility of contemporary new media arts, by interpreting the artwork as a reconstructor of a 'historical object' in Benjamin's context. According to this interpretation, <The Murder of Crows> makes an allegorical reading of <The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters> created in 18th century by F. Goya. The reason <The Murder of Crows>, consisting of meaningless and material noises, refers to the sounds and the artwork in the past is not that it has a nostalgia, but that it wants to cope with contemporary issues in a way only new media arts can do. This artwork reconstructs an audible world usually regarded as a 'monster' and repressed beneath the surface of modernity of which principles have been logics of representation and imaginary unity. With new sound technologies, the artwork tries to create an audible world as an object of experience by presenting fragmented sounds, the sensory data which did not exist in Goya's work. Inventing sounds as physical impacts and creating hallucinatory spaces without visual anchors, <The Murder of Crows> presents a positive way of reinterpreting the phenomena of severance and fragmentation caused by contemporary catastrophes.				본 연구는 동시대 작가 자넷 카디프(Janet Cardiff)와 조지 버레즈 밀러(George Bures Miller)의 사운드 설치 작품 <까마귀의 살해(The Murder of Crows)>(2008)를 벤야민의 알레고리 이론을 통해 분석함으로써 이 작품이 ‘사운드’라는 지각대상을 벤야민적인 의미에서 ‘역사적 대상’으로 구성하는 것으로 해석하고, 이를 통해 동시대 뉴 미디어 아트의 예술적 가능성을 규명해보고자 한다. 이 해석에 따르면, <까마귀의 살해>는 18세기 말의 작품인 고야의 <이성의 잠은 괴물을 낳는다>를 벤야민적 의미에서의 알레고리적으로 독해하고 있는 작품이다. 의미연관을 상실한 물질적 잡음으로서의 소리들을 사용하는 작품 <까마귀의 살해>가 과거의 소리와 과거의 작품을 참조하는 것은 지나간 시절에 대한 향수 때문이 아니라 뉴미디어 아트만이 수행할 수 있는 방식으로 동시대의 과제에 대응하기 위한 것이다. 이 작품은 사운드 테크놀러지를 통해, 고야 작품에서는 존재하지 않았던 감각자료인 사운드를 새롭게 제시하면서 재현 논리와 상상적 통일성에 지배되어온 모더니티의 이면에 억압된 ‘괴물’로서의 청각적 세계를 경험의 대상으로 재구성한다. 물질적 충격으로서의 사운드의 생성과 시각적 정박점 없는 환각적 공간의 창조를 통해, 이 작품은 파국의 시대가 낳은 절단과 파편화라는 작용을 긍정적인 방향에서 재해석하는 방법을 제시한다.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-0246		KJD:ART001852177		
J	김성호								The Fourth World Theory in Wonil Rhee's Curating : Focusing on ‘Post-colonialism’			이원일의 큐레이팅에 있어서의 ‘제4세계’론- 탈식민주의를 중심으로					The Journal of Aesthetics and Science of Art	미학예술학연구			40				249	292					2014	2014	This study is the follow-up of my dissertation A Study on Wonil Rhee's Curating: Focusing on Creative Paradox. This study is an investigation into his ‘perception and thematic consciousness’ of the discourse on post-colonialism and “practical curating methodology” the late curator Wonil Rhee inevitably faced when curating overseas international exhibitions as an Asian curator with an Asian identity. The researcher of this study sees the point his post-colonialist curating reached as the ‘fourth world theory’. Encompassing ‘Asia-centered international exhibitions’ and ‘Asian themes in international art shows’ to arrive at this conclusion, the researcher has closely examined international exhibitions Rhee curated, and looked through his exhibition catalog essays, interviews, and other documents. His post-colonialist perspective triggered by the ‘logic of resistance against the West and its practice’ that is represented as ‘Asian networking’ denoted in his early curating, concentrates on breaking down the line between the West and the non-West, cultural colonialists and non-colonialists, and the shift from resistance to conciliation and equilibrium. That is, his post-colonialist curating was to practice ‘hybridity’ as a way of resisting ‘globalization trying to accomplish homogeneity’. This is to elucidate that aspects of post-colonialism and neo-colonialism derived from the West's strategy of homogeneity in the name of ‘tolerance of pluralism’, and to employ the ‘hybridity’ Homi K. Bhabha presented as a way of resisting this. The concept of ‘hybridity’ emerged among numerous concepts such as ‘multiculturality, Post Geopolitics, mixed topo map, mixed culture, ground connection and Integration’. As a practical strategy for concrete curating anchored to this notion of ‘hybridity’ he defined it with ‘addictive mixture’, a productive hybridity of light. The researcher comments on this with ‘appropriation’, the concept of a post-colonialist practice by Bill Ashcroft and his fellow scholars. That is to say, the researcher understands that Rhee adopted ‘appropriation’ that uses the language of colonial ruling countries but deconstructs and reconstructs this as a strategy for post-colonial practice to deconstruct colonial rulers' dominant ideologies. Moreover, the researcher asserts that Rhee's global curating strategy is by nature nothing but an act of translation to ‘introduce the non-West to the West in the language of the West’. The researcher also takes note of a shift in Rhee's concern for ‘nonsensical time and space’ through the numerous possibilities of space-time or multi-contextual space-time on the border of the confrontation between the West and the non-West, cultural colonialists and non-cultural colonialists. The researcher coins the term ‘the fourth world’ as a wedding of sociological ‘poly-contextuality’ and physical ‘extra dimension’, departing from the notion of ‘the developing country’ from a socio-economical perspective, and explores its post-colonialist meaning as the ‘space-time of utopian conflation’. ‘The fourth world theory’ is to reinterpret Rhee's ‘absurd space-time’ conceived in the context of his curating shifting from the matter of the exterior to the matter of the interior, from the matter of the ideal to the matter of the experience. This theory is of great significance in that this may continue to his imaginary curating of ‘an exhibition in cosmic space’. This refers to a point where an ideal theory on post-colonialism was deformed and mysticized in Rhee's late curating. This change of direction serves as momentum to define him as a practitioner of post-colonialist curating who championed conciliation and equality with a new Asian thematic consciousness beyond the logic of resistance and subjugation, and simultaneously as a liberal pluralist of postmodernism and an upholder of elemental humanism.				본 연구는 연구자의 기발표 논문인 ｢이원일의 큐레이팅 연구-창조적 역설(Creative Paradox)｣을 잇는 후속편이다. 이 연구는 고 이원일 큐레이터(1960-2011)가 아시아인의 정체성으로서 해외의 국제전을 기획하는 가운데 필연적으로 맞닥뜨렸던 탈식민주의(Post-Colonialism) 담론에 대한 그의 ‘인식과 주제의식’ 그리고 ‘실천적 큐레이팅 방법론’이 무엇이었는지를 탐구한다. 연구자는 그의 탈식민주의적 큐레이팅의 실천이 도달한 지점을 ‘제4세계론’으로 파악한다. 이러한 결론에 도달하기 위해서 연구자는 ‘아시아 중심의 국제전’과 ‘국제전에서의 아시아적 주제’를 두루 아우르면서, 그가 기획한 국제전을 면밀히 살피는 한편, 그가 작성한 전시 카탈로그 서문, 인터뷰 내용들을 검토했다. 이원일의 초기 큐레이팅에 나타난 ‘아시안 네트워킹’이라는 ‘서구에 대한 단순한 저항의 논리와 실천’으로부터 시작된 그의 탈식민주의 관점은 이내 저항보다 화해, 균형이라는 관점으로 서구/비서구, 문화식민자/문화피식민자의 경계를 와해시키는데 집중된다. 즉 그의 탈식민주의적 큐레이팅은 ‘동질화를 도모하는 세계화’에 저항하는 방법으로 ‘혼성’을 실천하는 것이었다. 이것은 서구의 동질화의 전략이라는 것이 ‘다원주의의 용인’이라는 이름 아래 벌어지고 있는 후기식민주의, 신식민주의 양상임을 밝히는 것이자, 그것에 저항하는 방식으로서의 바바(Homi K. Bhabha)가 탈식민주의 실천으로 제시한 ‘혼성성(hybridity)’을 실천의 전략으로 삼는 것이었다. 특히 다문화성(Multiculturality), 탈지정학(Post Geopolitics), 혼성의 지형도(Mixed topo map), 문화혼성(Mixed culture), 접지(Ground Connection), 통합(Integration)과 같은 무수한 큐레이팅 개념들로 나타나고 있는 ‘혼성’에 관한 구체적인 큐레이팅의 실천적 전략으로 그는 빛의 생산적인 혼성인 ‘가산혼합(Additive mixture)’ 개념을 제시하는데, 이것을 연구자는 에쉬크로프트(Bill Ashcroft)와 동료들의 탈식민주의적 실천 개념인 ‘전유’를 통해 해설했다. 즉 연구자는 식민종주국의 언어를 사용하되 그것을 해체, 재구성하는 ‘전유’의 방식이 이원일에게서 식민종주국의 지배 이데올로기를 해체하는 탈식민주의적 실천 전략으로 사용되고 있는 것으로 파악했다. 덧붙여 연구자는 이러한 이원일의 글로벌 큐레이팅 전략이라는 것이 본질적으로 ‘비서구를 서구에게 서구의 언어로 소개’하는 탈식민주의적 실천으로서의 번역 행위에 다름 아님을 주장했다. 한편, 연구자는 서구/비서구, 문화식민자/문화피식민자의 대립의 경계 위, 혹은 경계 언저리에서 펼쳐지는 무수한 가능성의 시공간, 즉 다맥락성의 시공간을 통해서 그가 종국에는 ‘터무니없는 시공간’에 대한 관심으로 이동하고 있음을 주목한다. 나아가 연구자는 이원일의 이러한 실천적 전환점을 사회경제학적 관점의 개발도상국이라는 개념으로부터 탈주하면서 사회학적 ‘다맥락성’과 물리학적 ‘덧차원(extra dimension)’이 결합된 개념으로 ‘제4세계’를 작명하고 그것의 ‘유토피아적 융합의 시공간’으로서의 탈식민주의적 의미를 탐구한다. ‘제4세계’는 그의 큐레이팅 맥락이 외부의 문제로부터 내면의 문제로, 이상의 문제로부터 경험의 문제로 이동하는 차원에서 고안된 그의 소주제 ‘터무니없는 시공간’을 재해석하는 것이다. 제4세계론은 그의 큐레이팅에 있어서 ‘우주 공간에서의 전시’라는 상상기획으로 이어진다는 점에서 그에게 매우 주요한 주제의식이다. 그것은 탈식민주의에 대한 이상론이 이원일의 후기 큐레이팅 실제에서 변형되고 일부 신비화되는 방향성으로 전환되고 있는 한 지점을 형성한다. 이러한 방향 전환은 그를 저항과 극복이라는 논리로부터 화해와 평등을 주장하는 새로운 아시아적 주체의식을 견지한 탈식민주의 큐레이팅의 실천자로 정초시키면서도 ‘포스트모더니즘의 자유주의적 다원주의자’로, ‘근본적인 휴머니즘 옹호자’로 정초시키는 또 다른 계기가 된다.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-0246		KJD:ART001852509		
J	Barker, Jason								Pleasure Revisited: The Male Gaze								The Journal of Criticism and Theory	비평과이론			19	1			199	219					2014	2014	This article returns to Laura Mulvey’s theory of the male gaze, which dates from her seminal essay of 1975, “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,” published in the British film journal Screen. Mulvey’s politicization of Lacanian psychoanalysis in the service of a militant feminist reading of film narrative pre-dates Zizek’s contributions to film theory by more than a decade. The article considers the strengths and weaknesses of Mulvey’s theory, correcting her reading of Freud and Lacan on the concepts of the unconscious and on desire (the latter in its “real,” as opposed to “imaginary” manifestation) and then applies a “real” theory of desire to a reading of The Dark Knight Rises. Finally the article considers whether psychoanalytic theory can, as Mulvey originally intended, retain the power of a “political weapon” in liberating feminine sexuality - as opposed to sexuality in general - from sexual objectification.									0	0	0	0	0	1598-9089		KJD:ART001886114		
J	Barker, Jason								Towards An Ethic and Theory of Literature without Alterity								The Journal of English Language and Literature	영어영문학			60	1			77	89					2014	2014	Globalization of contemporary literature raises the prospect of ethics inthe name of alterity. Through cultural pluralism comes the responsibilityon writers and readers alike to recognize and respect difference, or otherness. This article highlights the difficulties of constructing an ethicfounded on such assumptions, which over the years has drawn theoreticalinspiration from the work of the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan,often in an attempt to attest to the trauma and suffering of the post-colonialage. The philosopher Simon Critchley is arguably a promoter of sucha reading of Lacan, and of a “structural homology” between Lacan andEmmanuel Levinas, on ethical questions. But such an ethic is inconsistent,arguably ending up as an apology for the political states of affairsthat generate trauma and suffering in the first place. This article attemptsto correct certain key misunderstandings of Lacan’s work, with referenceto Lacan’s Imaginary, Symbolic and Real orders of the psyche, whichalso correspond to consecutive phases of his overall teaching of psychoanalysis. Reference is also made to the work of Alain Badiou and MichelFoucault respectively as welcome antidotes to the messianic pretensionsof Levinasian ethics, and in order to point the way towards a-signifyingtheories of literature. There is ultimately a passage in Lacan’s workthrough the Symbolic and Real orders of the psyche, from the concept of“signifier” to the “letter,” and in conclusion the article speculates, albeittentatively, that here one might find the theoretical resources for a“rubbish theory of literature,” one that would seek to divorce literaturefrom the art of pathos and the ethics of the self and its other.									0	0	0	0	0	1016-2283		KJD:ART001867261		
J	김은경								Superego and Ideology: Frankenstein			초자아와 이데올로기:『프랑켄슈타인』					The Journal of Teaching English Literature	영미문학교육			18	1			107	143					2014	2014	This paper aims to reveal the close cooperation between superego and ideology through Victor and Monster, in Frankenstein. Superego, explained by a dialectic between incestuous desire (with its Sadean voice ‘Enjoy’) and prohibition of incest, strengthens Kantian moral law. Prohibition stimulates desire to violate a law to attain the tabooed object. The stronger the prohibition, the greater the conflict between law and desire, and paradoxically the more the subject willingly observes the law. Superego, located deep inside the subject and demanding the observation of social rules, in opposition to desire, reinforces ideology. Ideology centers the individual, becomes a medium that forms an imaginary relationship between individual and society, and provides constant purpose and stable identity. The unstable empty individual (prior to the constraining influence of ideology) feels complete satisfaction but mistakes the fictional ideology as an “Object a,” that satisfies that lack. Both Victor and Monster, although antagonists, competitively pursue the 19C “Imperialistic Bourgeois Family” {IBF} ideology as their ego ideal. Victor denies Monster access to the IBF ideal. Monster threatens Victor’s personal family members and kills some of them in order to obtain his own family pursuing the forbidden IBF ideal. The more Victor bans Monster from acquiring a family, the more Monster’s desire is fortified. The family is increasingly idealized as the perfect satisfaction originally experienced from Mother’s Breast. Paradoxically however, their hostile struggle solidifies the IBF ideology. As Victor’s prevention and Monster’s desire become extreme, their superegos experience the “Jouissance” resulting from the pain they suffer from their conflict. They do not realize that the IBF image as an “Object a,” has been fabricated by colonizers to discriminate against “Otherized” peoples. They do not become aware until the last moment that the IBF image is just a deception fostering the illusion of original perfection. Superego actively engages in firmly stabilizing ideology as an “Object a” via the dialectic between law and desire.									0	0	0	0	0	1229-2249		KJD:ART001872841		
J	Jeong, Hyogoo								Study on Aspects of Self-Exploration in Poems of Lee Seung-hunin a Perspective of Consciousness-Only Theory of Buddhism			佛敎唯識論으로 본 이승훈 시의 자아탐구 양상					The Korean Language and Literature	국어국문학			166				357	384					2014	2014	Lee Seung-hun published more than 20 collections of poems for the last 50 years since he started his literary career in 1962. To describe his poem creating process in a word, it would be described as a journey for ‘self- exploration’. He is a poet of self-exploration which is typical and problematic in current affairs. Through this self-exploration journey, he developed his view of ego, view of man, view of life and view of the world while presenting true ways to the human growth and self-realization. By setting modern individual or subject, independent from God as self, he played a huge role in suggesting how to accept advantages of modern life and beyond which where to reach to a lot of people leading a life, which has become universal. Such self-exploration matters of Lee Seung-hun and his journey are exa mined on the basis of Consciousness-only theory of Buddhism in this study. It is because Consciousness-only theory of Buddhism was thought to help discuss self-exploration matters of Lee Seung-hun in depth that have been studied so far. Approaching with Consciousness-only theory of Buddhism is a highly appropriate method for finding out deep structure of spirit of Lee Seung-hun, who had a long journey of self-exploration. Results shown from studying self-exploration matters of Lee Seung-hun on the basis of Consciousness-only theory of Buddhism are as follows. Lee Seung-hun passed through 3 steps to human growth, which are Imaginary nature, Interdependent nature and Absolute nature, which three natures of Consciousness-only in Buddhism suggests. In ‘Poem of Subjective Object’ in early days, unconsciousness was sought by denying objects on imaginary nature while ‘Poem of Self-Extinction’ in the middle days was about self- absence or difference, seeing the world of interdependent nature with a perspective of imaginary nature. ‘Poem of Non-dual Ego’ in the latter days read Zen-Buddhist non-dual ego or integrity of non-dual subject and object, seeing the world of interdependent nature with a perspective of absolute nature. To describe three natures of Consciousness-only process above in a word, it would be described as a way to ‘Turning the deluded mind into wisdom and enlightenment’ or a way to ‘Turning knowledge into wisdom’. Lee Seung-hun only saw the world of ‘knowledge’ and on which he continued self-exploration during the period of his early and middle days' poems. However, entering his latter days, he started to see the world of ‘wisdom’ and it helped him search for self-exploration in the world of ‘wisdom’ beyond the world of ‘knowledge’. As Consciousness-only theory of Buddhism suggests, when human passes through 3 steps of three natures of Consciousness-only and follows the way of Turning the deluded mind into wisdom and enlightenment, human experi ences the life of ‘Emancipation from grasping and suffering’. In other words, it is experiencing the world of ‘Joy’ based on big-self or selflessness beyond the world of ‘Suffering’ based on little-self or self-existence. Such process and change remain intact in the 50-year journey of self-exploration of Lee Seung-hun.									0	0	0	0	0	0451-0097		KJD:ART001862998		
J	Panigyrakis, George; Zarkada, Anna								A philosophical investigation of the transition from integrated marketing communications to metamodern meaning co-creation									Journal of Global Scholars of Marketing Science(마케팅과학연구)|全球营销科学学报			24	3			262	278					2014	2014	This article contributes to the recent problematisation of the co-evolution of philosophyand marketing thought as we experience a transition from the deification of greed,individualism and hedonic consumption seen during the postmodern period of thetwentieth century to the brutal class restructuring and shattering of a number ofillusions of metamodernity at the beginning of the twenty-first century. It examinesthe philosophical foundations of advertising and communication and demonstrates theways in which current technological and socio-political advances are renderingtraditional approaches obsolete. As marketing is now recognised to be the mechanismpar excellence for value co-production, so advertising – and communication in general– are but mechanisms of meaning co-production through a dialogue between thedisillusioned but empowered consumer and the brand and corporation on solidarity,responsibility, morality, dignity and the sense of belonging in a community. It is herebyargued that values are far more relevant to contemporary consumers than the pursuit ofan idealised lifestyle based on celluloid images of the imaginary Joneses, and thus it isadvocated that discipline-wide changes need to be made.									0	0	0	0	0	2163-9159		KJD:ART001882164

This study examined the characteristics of these abilities in the older adults by comparing differences among age groups. A video game task was devised to evaluate response times from various angles of rotation. Four hundred twenty-eight healthy individuals aged 6 to 79 years (eight age groups at 10-year intervals) participated. Average response times for each age group confirmed a curvilinear change that accelerated from childhood to early adulthood and decelerated in later life. However, older participants did not display inferior performance compared with the younger adults on the response times to rotate an imaginary self to a 180 position. These results confirm previous findings that spatial perspective taking, particularly imagining body movement, remains robust in normal aging.									0	0	0	0	0	0091-4150		WOS:000339659100004	25265681	
J	Krzyzanowski, Michal								Values, imaginaries and templates of journalistic practice: a Critical Discourse Analysis								SOCIAL SEMIOTICS				24	3			345	365		10.1080/10350330.2014.930607			2014	2014	This article shows that templates are not only crucial for the ways in which journalists construct or structure the media discourse but also for how they perceive themselves and others in the process of journalistic practice. A Critical Discourse Analysis of interviews with Polish journalists on their practices related to reporting migration - a topic largely discarded and ignored by the Polish media - shows that the construction of practice in the journalistic field constantly negotiates the contradiction between "knowing-it-all", a key element of the template of journalistic habitus/identity, and the frequent lack of experience or limited knowledge of practice and of journalistic work. The analysis reveals that, while often using a discursive strategy of pre-legitimation, journalists enact templates that blur the boundaries between discourses about experiences of journalistic work and imaginaries or scenarios of actions they would only potentially undertake. Journalistic discourses of practice thereby become increasingly displaced, that is, they run along similar templates of discourse of/about quasi-universalised ethics and values of journalism almost irrespective of media organisations of the informants. By the same token, it is emphasised that, rather than being limited by the ideologies and powers of media organisations, agency seems to be often self-constrained by journalists in their self-entrapment in values, templates and imaginaries of journalism.									0	0	0	0	0	1035-0330		WOS:000339853500005		
J	Doucet, Isabelle								ARCHITECTURE BETWEEN POLITICS AND AESTHETICS: Peter Wilson's "Ambivalent Criticality" at the Architectural Association in the 1970s								ARCHITECTURAL THEORY REVIEW				19	1	SI		98	115		10.1080/13264826.2014.912574			2014	2014	Through which registers does criticality operate in architecture and how can its political, social, and aesthetic concerns be reconciled? Such questions were at the centre of the post-1968 crisis of criticality and have resurfaced in recent debates under the banner of the "postcritical". This paper contributes to the historicising of this debate through the unpacking of Peter Wilson's The Fire: 2, a 1974 student project he developed at the Architectural Association (AA) in London. The Fire: 2 is an imaginary scenario for a post-disaster London and comprises of a monumental, enclosed ensemble of seven 1 km x 1 km squares connected through the River Thames. Through Wilson's project, this article challenges an overly dismissive evaluation of (all) postmodern architectural drawings as mere stylistic reverie. Historically, it contributes to a deeper understanding of the convergences and tensions between politics and aesthetics, and between disciplinary critique and an engagement with the world "out there", at the dawn of architectural postmodernism. The Fire: 2 is particularly instructive since it is not only a product of the AA, which played a pivotal role in the formation of the critical discourse of the 1970s and 1980s, it is also the product of a student who, immersed in a politically charged AA, set out to craft his own architectural voice in both political and aesthetic terms. In order to access the resultant ambivalent criticality, I will not explain the project through unproductive pairs such as opposition-appeasement, politics-aesthetics, or withdrawal-engagement. Instead, I unpack the different registers of critical engagement that are at work in the drawings. Because Wilson deploys the drawings as a vehicle for both personal, artistic expression and critical engagement, The Fire: 2 offers a unique resource for revisiting this recent history.									0	0	0	0	0	1326-4826		WOS:000340203700008

Dynamic architectural configuration is presented as a series of open processes based on graphical actions. Imagination is established as the source and act of project desire, and the images are defined as organization and configuration diagrams of de imagination contents. The need to transform that first mental image, of imaginary trigger, into a productive architectural image.Architectural drawing is established as the appropriate mechanism for the conception of project, and the Formal Architectural Analysis as it's conceptual tool. It concludes with experience developed at the Drawing subject, Analysis and Ideation 2 (DAI 2), framing it's teaching at the beginning of the project, and beyond the skills acquired at the Drawing subject, Analysis and Ideation 1 (DAI 1) all of it proving the task of the graphic work in the process of architectural creation.									0	0	0	0	0	1133-6137		WOS:000340025900044

J	Hueckmann, Dania								Beyond Law and Justice: Revenge in Jean Amery								GERMANIC REVIEW				89	2			233	248		10.1080/00168890.2014.919200			2014	2014	How can we conceive of justice after Auschwitz? This question informs all of Jean Amery's writings. While Amery is famous for his defense of ressentiments and for problematizing the demand of forgiveness put on survivors after the war, I argue that a consideration of his reflections on revenge are indispensible for reaching a fuller understanding of his complex engagement with individual and collective notions of justice after Auschwitz. In his essay collection Jenseits von Schuld und Suhne (1966), Amery is quick to dismiss the idea of revenge. However, the protagonist of Lefeu oder der Abbruch (1974), a Holocaust survivor, indulges in a fantasy of vengeance, followed by the fantasy of being brought to trial for his quest for justice. Relegating both revenge and the court to the realm of the imaginary, Amery depicts them in their failure to bring about justice and foregrounds the survivor's struggle to be heard by his or her community. I demonstrate that Amery-in dialogue with Hannah Arendt, Theodor W. Adorno, and Simon Wiesenthal-is not primarily interested in the contours of justice as a juridical concept as much as he is renegotiating the terms of justice, community, and remembrance after the war.									0	0	0	0	0	0016-8890		WOS:000340267700006

In this country, as elsewhere, the so-called adventure sports are among the main expressions of this relationship. In general, many of these sports claim a status of innovation and originality, sometimes challenging the conceptual parameters for the more common definition of sport. However, the construction of these imaginary is strongly influenced by a long historical process. Accordingly, leisure experiences in nature, in historical development since the nineteenth century, play an important role in the current allocation of the social meaning of extreme or adventure sports.									0	0	0	0	0	0952-3367		WOS:000340122400004

I suggest looking at the report as a techno-political tool that seeks to produce and disseminate knowledge about crisis and conflicts in different parts of the world, while packaged and structured in a universal format. As a first step I analyse the particular features of this format, such as size and scale. The main argument is that the report presents itself as an assemblage of a series of technical characteristics that help to shrink the world and make it fit the model format of the crisis expert. In a second step I open up the perspective and link the report's micro-format to bigger questions on governing the world today. Here, I argue that, within current imaginaries of emergency, impending crisis and global terrorism, the crisis report functions as a particular kind of sentinel. I show that it can speak through the language of constant alertness and, crucially, the production of sentinel subjectivities that must be continuously monitored.									0	0	0	0	0	0143-6597		WOS:000340209100004		
J	Popovic, Milica; Belc, Petra								YUGONOSTALGIA: YUGOSLAVIA AS A META-SPACE IN CONTEMPORARY ART PRACTICES								ZIVOT UMJETNOSTI					94			18	35					2014	2014	In the postsocialist meta-space of now non-existing Yugoslavia, art practices persist and communicate in the same space in which they operated before the demise of the socialist state, just as they had done before its foundation. This same space, permeated by the official discourses that both deny the socialist past and banalize it by translating it into pop culture, uses the relationship with that "non-existing" past in the processes of identity formation, participating in art practices that focus on the "imaginary" pasts and spaces of socialist Yugoslavia, which raises the issue of the imaginary/real in Yugoslav cultural space. Focusing on the examples of Serbia and Croatia, this paper seeks to map the different ways, forms, and media in which Yugoslavia appears in the contemporary artistic production, viewing it the prism of the theories of remembrance and focusing on the efficiency of nostalgia as a potentially subversive element in an artwork. Offering a selection of post-Yugoslav art practices, specifically those of the younger generation of artists, the authors seek to identify the political stance of this generation towards Yugoslavia and the revisionist narratives of the states. In other words: what does the contemporary art production thematizing Yugoslavia tell us about the contemporary society and the meta-space that we inhabit (and vice versa)?									0	0	0	0	0	0514-7794		WOS:000340083100001

At six months, parenting quality and parental behaviours were measured using the Parent-Child Early Relational Assessment, and the frequency of mental-state references made during mother-infant interactions was recorded. Temperament was assessed using the Revised Infant Temperament Questionnaire. Parents then completed questionnaires assessing whether their children had ICs at 44 months of age. The results revealed that only the approach characteristic of temperament marginally predicted children's IC status. Results of the parental measures showed that parents of children with ICs were more likely to attribute mental states to their child and to refrain from intruding in their child's behaviours than parents of children without ICs. The results indicated that parental behaviours are important for children's creation of ICs.									0	0	0	0	0	1740-5629		WOS:000340392300006

J	Noguera Fernández, Albert								Juventud, memoria y derechos en tiempos de crisis Una reflexión desde la crítica literaria de Walter Benjamin y la generación perdida de "Historias del Kronen"	Youth, memory and rights in times of crisis A reflection from de literary critic of Walter Benjamin and the lost generation of "Historias del Kronen"							Revista Derecho del Estado					32			125	143					2014-01	2014	From the work of the literary critic Walter Benjamin this article explains how the recovery of historical memory and its connection to the present, is essential to build a collective political project capable of restoring democracy, rights and social justice dismantled today with the death of the Constitutional State in Europe. This entails putting on the table two complex issues. The first is the involvement in the project of a generation of disenchanted youth who has broken all ties with the political and social values of previous generations and who build their vital referents and role models through consumerism and its imaginary. This generation has been very suggestively described in the novel, after converted in film, Historias del Kronen. The second is the use or treatment to be given to the Memory to make it a useful instrument for the proposed purpose.	A partir de la obra del crítico literario Walter Benjamin el presente artículo explica cómo la recuperación de la Memoria histórica y su conexión con el presente constituye un elemento indispensable para poder construir un proyecto político colectivo capaz de recuperar la democracia, los derechos y la justicia social hoy desmantelados con la muerte del Estado constitucional en Europa. Este objetivo implica poner sobre la mesa dos cuestiones complejas. La primera es la implicación en este proyecto de una generación de jóvenes desencantada que ha roto todos los lazos con los valores políticos y sociales de las generaciones anteriores y que construye sus referentes vitales y modelos a seguir a través del consumismo y sus imaginarios. Generación descrita muy sugerentemente por la novela, después película, Historias del Kronen. La segunda es la referida a los usos o tratamiento que hay que dar a la Memoria para convertirla en un instrumento útil para el fin planteado.								0	0	0	0	0	0122-9893		SCIELO:S0122-98932014000100007		
J	Gale, Trevor; Hodge, Steven								Just imaginary: delimiting social inclusion in higher education								BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY OF EDUCATION				35	5	SI		688	709		10.1080/01425692.2014.919841			2014	2014	This paper explores the notion of a 'just imaginary' for social inclusion in higher education. It responds to the current strategy of OECD nations to expand higher education and increase graduate numbers, as a way of securing a competitive advantage in the global knowledge economy. The Australian higher education system provides the case for analysis. Three dilemmas for social inclusion policy in this context are identified: questions of sustainability, aspiration and opportunity. The paper argues that while social inclusion policy has 'first-order' effects in higher education, a just imaginary is required for more inclusive 'second-order' effects to be realized. It concludes that transformation of the current imaginary will require a more robust theorization of relations between social inclusion and higher education, to give new and unifying meaning to existing practices and to generate new ones. Short of this, social inclusion may be little more than just imaginary.									0	0	0	0	0	0142-5692		WOS:000341129800004		
J	Shoup, Brian D.; Holmes, Carolyn E.								Recrafting the national imaginary and the new "vanguardism"								DEMOCRATIZATION				21	5			958	978		10.1080/13510347.2013.777431			2014	2014	An opportunity exists to assess the limitations in building long-term peace in post-conflict states, particularly given the extent to which negotiated settlements incorporate demands for democratic mechanisms. By assessing how post-conflict governments construct new majorities through policy tools as well as assessing how they are constrained by the structural realities of negotiated settlements, we gain some purchase on the reasons why some post-conflict state projects succeed while others fail. This has potentially transformative implications for our understanding of how social contracts, and their attendant issues of consent, dissent, and legitimacy, operate in the modern world and the ways they impact such critical discussions as democratic transition, post-conflict reconciliation, and nation-building. We use the case of post-apartheid South Africa to analyse how post-conflict states are limited in terms of forging social contracts among citizens and between citizens and governments. Of specific interest is the way that post-conflict social contracting compels nation-builders to eschew the uncertainties of viable electoral democracy in favour of dominant party regimes or electoral authoritarianism. We suggest that this tension is less a result of pecuniary interest on the part of nation-builders and more a consequence of the imperfections of the modern social contracting process.									0	0	0	0	0	1351-0347		WOS:000341335600010		
J	Griffiths, Alison								The carceral aesthetic: Seeing prison on film during the early cinema period								EARLY POPULAR VISUAL CULTURE				12	2	SI		174	198		10.1080/17460654.2014.928987			2014	2014	This article examines how actuality and fictional films about prisoners made during the early cinema period construct a carceral imaginary that appropriated visual tropes from the Middle Ages while experimenting with motion picture's unique signifying properties. The essay constructs a genealogy of prison-set motion pictures made before 1914, a period overlooked in standard prison film histories, starting with actualities of prisoners including The Lock Step (1899) and Female Prisoners: Detroit House of Corrections (1899), and fictional one-reelers Scenes of Convict Life (1905) and Children's Reformatory (1907). Aspects of prison iconicity explored in this essay include the cell as a penitential but occasionally anarchic space, the lockstep and prison uniform, and the representation of escape. The trick film's mocking of penal authority via the metamorphoses of convicts' bodies in When Prison Bars and Fetters are Useless (1909) and the subversion of time in The Impossible Convicts, provides a potentially deeper understanding of prison's 'structure of feeling' than the later prison film. Unencumbered by the generic conventions of the studio system era, early prison films provide a striking vantage point from which to explore prison and prisoner's paradoxical place within the popular imaginary.									0	0	0	0	0	1746-0654		WOS:000341146900004		
J	Baston, Kim								Harlequin Highlander: Spectacular geographies at the Edinburgh Equestrian Circus, 1790-1800								EARLY POPULAR VISUAL CULTURE				12	3			283	303		10.1080/17460654.2014.920717			2014	2014	In 1790, a dedicated circus building was constructed in Edinburgh by the equestrian performers and circus proprietors, George Jones and William Parker. The new Edinburgh Circus operated as an adjunct of both Sadler's Wells and the Royal Circus in London, transferring both performers and repertoire from those venues. As a sound business practice, the proprietors of the circus remained responsive to the demands of the Edinburgh audience - including the presentation of elaborate spectacles with Scottish settings, which had been successful in the London houses. But how did a troupe from London, producing Scottish-themed productions that had originated in London, represent Scotland to the Scottish? During this decade the war with France was also echoed in the Edinburgh Circus, in lavish spectacles that clearly emphasised a patriotic appeal to an idea of 'Great Britain'. This article examines the intersection of imaginary and spectacular geographies presented in the entertainments of this first circus in Scotland.									0	0	0	0	0	1746-0654		WOS:000341147200001

The fantasies of the 'ideal' worker created by recruiters have a particular hold on migrant subjectivity, but they often hide inconsistencies and slippages implicit within the fabric of recruitment discourse and practice. By drawing on the notions of fantasy and desire as developed by Jacques Lacan, this paper analyses the determination of subjectivity in a migration context and explores both unconscious and conscious processes of identification. On the basis of an analysis of drawings sketched by respondents during qualitative interviews conducted in Latvia, it challenges narrower assumptions about migrants' search behaviour and stable expectations of labour migration, and exposes the split and contested nature of migrant selfhood. It concludes with conceptual observations about the complex process of identification and the unachievable figure of the 'ideal' worker.									0	0	0	0	0	0263-7758		WOS:000340959000007		
J	Hiemstra, Nancy								Performing homeland security within the US immigrant detention system								ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY & SPACE				32	4			571	588		10.1068/d13021p			2014	2014	This paper examines the critical role played by the US immigrant detention and deportation apparatus in the construction of contemporary imaginaries of homeland security. I argue that the detention system works performatively by substantiating a paradoxical relationship between security and insecurity for system employees. Through research conducted in Ecuador with detained migrants' families and deported migrants, I scrutinize the behavior of detention personnel and the experiences of detainees. Data illustrate how the US detention system becomes an integral part of the governmental apparatus behind homeland security imaginaries. First, employees are disciplined through the constant repetition of narratives in which immigrants are immoral and untrustworthy. Second, the detention system is structured in such a way as to require employees to perceive detainees as sources of insecurity, through inconsistent policies, conditions of detention, and high volume and mobility of detainees. Consequently, I contend, employees' interactions with detainees play an important and under-recognized role in performing homeland security imaginaries by perpetuating and reinforcing negative tropes of immigrants as criminalized, dangerous outsiders. The paper contributes to understanding ways in which multiple and overlapping governmentalities work recursively in the country's immigration apparatus, as well as shedding light on the typically opaque detention and deportation process.									0	0	0	0	0	0263-7758		WOS:000340963700001

J	Hammershoj, Lars Geer				du, guanglei/A-9003-2014				Creativity in education as a question of cultivating sensuous forces								THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY				13				168	182		10.1016/j.tsc.2014.05.003			2014	2014	Creativity has proven to be highly resistant to conceptualization, which poses a fundamental problem for creativity in education: Without knowledge of what drives the process, it is difficult to foster creativity. This difficulty is reflected in the tendencies of current research. Creativity is often defined in terms of a set of separate qualities that make it difficult to distinguish creativity from processes of learning and problem solving. The aim of the article is to contribute to the understanding of the creative process and to develop a strategy for fostering creativity. To this end, the article draws on the social-analytical theory of creativity understood as Bildung, the German concept of formation of the personality. According to this theory, creativity is the interplay of the sensuous forces of imagination, transcendence, and judgment. Thus, fostering creativity is a matter of cultivating these forces and their interplay. The article builds on this idea to develop a strategy for fostering creativity that involves an educational journey inspired by Dante's Divine Comedy. Finally the article attempts to identify the dominant processes of creativity at different levels of the educational system and suggests that these are "imaginary play" in kindergarten, "produce play" in primary school, "positioning humour" in secondary school, and "personal expression" in upper secondary.

J	Pires, Eloiza Gurgel								Experiência e linguagem em Walter Benjamin	Experience and language in Walter Benjamin							Educação e Pesquisa					ahead			0	0		10.1590/s1517-97022014041524			2014	2014	This article presents a reflection about the Benjamin's theory of language. Walter Benjamin, german philosopher and literary critic in the early decades of the twentieth century produced a landmark study in which language can not be considered as a mere instrument of compilers of reality nor as simple abstraction, but is designed as a field in which emerges an intricate network of relationships between knowledge and experience. For the philosopher, the language is the spiritual medium and historical experience. The concept of Erfahrung (experience) runs through all his work: youth from a text written in 1913, entitled Erfahrung (1933), in which the author disputes the disaffection of youth enthusiasm on behalf of the experience of adults, the theses 1940 . This concept is closely related in his writings, the thought that all human manifestations and expressions can be designed as a language, and this, in turn, is then designed in its symbolic dimension, unlike the philosophers who wanted clarification when indicated, as a condition for true knowledge, a rationality that separated the imaginary thinking. Contrary scientific Enlightenment thought, the aesthetic paradigm is essential in benjaminianos writings. From the host of the concept in the image show up new ways of knowing. In this perspective , we attempt to discuss the thought of Benjamin showing joints and ruptures engendered with problematizations formed from existing connections between language and experience and their relation to the education field.		Este artigo apresenta uma reflexão a respeito da teoria da linguagem benjaminiana. Walter Benjamin, filósofo e crítico literário alemão, nas primeiras décadas do século XX, produziu um estudo decisivo no qual a linguagem não pode ser considerada como mero instrumento de elaboração dos dados da realidade nem como simples abstração, mas é pensada como campo no qual emerge uma intrincada rede de relações entre conhecimento e experiência. Para o filósofo, a linguagem é o médium espiritual e histórico da experiência. O conceito de Erfahrung (experiência) atravessa toda a sua obra: desde um texto de juventude, escrito em 1913, intitulado Erfahrung (1933), em que o autor contesta o desinteresse dos entusiasmos juvenis em nome da experiência dos adultos, às teses de 1940. Esse conceito está intrinsecamente relacionado, em seus escritos, ao pensamento de que todas as manifestações e expressões humanas podem ser concebidas como linguagem e, essa, por sua vez, é então pensada na sua dimensão simbólica, ao contrário do que pretendiam os filósofos do esclarecimento quando apontavam, como condição para o verdadeiro conhecimento, uma racionalidade que separava o imaginário do pensamento. Na contramão do pensamento iluminista científico, o paradigma estético é fundamental nos escritos benjaminianos. A partir do acolhimento do conceito na imagem, evidenciam-se novas formas de conhecer. Nessa perspectiva, tentaremos discutir o pensamento de Benjamin mostrando as articulações e rupturas engendradas com as problematizações constituídas a partir das conexões existentes entre linguagem e experiência e sua relação com o campo educativo.							0	0	0	0	0	1517-9702		SCIELO:S1517-97022014005000017

Um estudo a partir da semiótica social de Halliday						Tabula Rasa					20			329	345					2014-01	2014	In the research work on "imaginaries among peddlers in Bogotá's transportation system", being developed at universidad Colegio Mayor de Cundinamarca, one can note that when studying language in a context, a lexical item may change or get a deeper meaning as a result of the cultural and ideological situation it works in. This is the case of peddlers, in whose discourse targeting commercial exchange, the choice of certain lexical-grammatical resources and the use of a rhetorical method become key strategies to ensure day-to-day survival. Within the framework of Halliday's social semiotics, and based upon a corpus of 65 sheets, this paper presents a thematic analysis, showing stereotypes that are crystallized on the dynamic of the mercantile act, along with iterations in opening, development and closing formulae that are observed in the rhetorics of rebusque.	En la investigación en desarrollo actualmente en la universidad Colegio Mayor de Cundinamarca sobre los «imaginarios de los vendedores ambulantes del transporte en Bogotá», se advierte que, cuando se estudia el lenguaje en contexto, un ítem léxico puede variar o profundizar el significado por la situación cultural e ideológica en donde opera. Tal es el caso de los vendedores informales, en cuyo discurso destinado a lograr el intercambio mercantil, la elección de ciertos recursos léxico-gramaticales y el uso de un método retórico se constituyen en estrategias claves para garantizar la sobrevivencia diaria. En el marco de la semiótica social de Halliday, y a partir de un corpus compuesto por 65 fichas, en este artículo se realiza un análisis temático, que muestra los estereotipos cristalizados en la dinámica del acto mercantil con las reiteraciones de las fórmulas de apertura, desarrollo y cierre presentes en la retórica del rebusque.

Those advances have to do with social imaginaries about grassroots subjects and citizens who are subject to rigths and responsibilities. Those imaginaries were created by former inhabitants and community leaders from six slums in the city of Cartagena (Colombia), and were built upon histories, fights, survival mechanisms, and social, cultural, political and economic processes, so that they could be able to establish the processes staying, being transformed, disappearing and appearing in these categorizations or social «labels», being brought about those same poor sectors and social policies. To do this, both qualitative and quantitative research approaches were followed through discourse analysis and techniques like in-depth interviews, observation and polls.

J	Subercaseaux, Bernardo								DOGS AND LITERATURE: THE HUMAN CONDITION AND THE ANIMAL CONDITION								ATENEA					509			33	62					2014	2014	This article explores canine representations and imaginaries in modern literature and culture, distinguishing different modes in Hispanic, American and European narratives. It is suggested that with the proliferation of mascots in late capitalism, osmosis has been produced between human and canine society, creating an interaction that has a correlation in literature. It is an osmosis that paradoxically reveals the humanity of animals and the unsociability and spiritual isolation of human beings. Reaffirming the specific character of literary language such as unconcealment and revelation, this article proposes distinct variables-philosophical, scientific and socio-historic in order to address the corpus and question canine imaginaries in literature, above all in respect to the human condition vis a vis the animal condition and vice versa.									0	0	0	0	0	0718-0462		WOS:000341223600003

The Gellnerian modality revisited: towards a 'genealogy' of cultural homogenization and nation-state congruency								ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES				37	11			2014	2033		10.1080/01419870.2013.788728			2014	2014	This paper re-evaluates Ernest Gellner's theory of nations and nationalism and particularly his conceptions of cultural homogenization and congruency. The paper shows how Gellner's historical and epistemological stance naturalizes homogenization processes and rationalizes modern history as an inevitable trajectory of congruency making of states and nations. The paper proposes, nonetheless, to deploy a critical framework and read Gellner's notions of congruency and cultural homogenization as a 'social imaginary'/'fantasy'. That is, understanding congruency as a sociopolitical project that idealizes a certain imaginary as positive, necessary and inevitable - a 'fantasy' that sets to secure and stabilize discursively the contingency of social relations. It is suggested, moreover, to deploy a Foucauldian genealogical technique in an attempt to de-naturalize congruency and homogenization practices and expose the conditions of their emergence in modern history.									0	0	0	0	0	0141-9870		WOS:000341407200002

Dialectical structures, though rarely associated with Claude, are a staple of Baroque poetics and thus highly relevant to artworks created in Rome in the second quarter of the seventeenth century. The binary structure of land and sea, colliding and interpenetrating in Claude's paintings, is here considered to be a sophisticated pictorial commentary on the vicissitudes of Mediterranean history, supplemented by the diachronic dimension of the narrative content that the mature examples of the seaport series incorporate. Indeed, this is the aspect that J. M. W Turner, two centuries after Claude, brought to the fore in his own versions of his admired predecessor's harbour scenes.									0	0	0	0	0	0342-1201		WOS:000342040300004

They express the imaginary of the time, which are often constant throughout the history of mankind. This location across borders allows us to see the importance of the interrelationship between the arts, humanities and social sciences over the social imaginary, which were separated with the consolidation of modernity, based in dichotomies that must be overcome to achieve a more complex and profound vision of reality. In this paper we analyze the Renaissance and socialist utopias and imaginary expressions that reflect social reality, as well as actual the absence of structured utopias.	Las utopías, en tanto obras de frontera entre el arte, las humanidades y las ciencias sociales, expresan los imaginarios de su época, que son muchas veces constantes a lo largo de la historia de la humanidad.

In the years after 1918, Soviet Russia increasingly replaced Germany as a focus for concern in a new 'invasion literature', which fretted about the possibility of Moscow seeking to foment class war in Britain. Numerous 'Tales of the Future' were published describing imaginary scenarios in which external enemies sought to promote domestic unrest in order to make Britain more vulnerable to invasion. These narratives articulated a diffuse sense of popular anxiety about the fragility of the status quo and its vulnerability to challenges emanating both at home and from abroad.									0	0	0	0	0	1361-9462		WOS:000342288000003

It is an engaging story of what is a case study in the way communications technologies are becoming part of broader struggles for liberation not just in the 'connected' centres, but also in more isolated areas. The aims of the international empowerment project called 'Nonviolence 2.0' are to serve as a forum for developing peace, understanding and tolerance between groups engaged in a long and ongoing conflict. What is significant in it is the use of personal narratives that humanize both sides of the conflict, as well as of mobile technologies to record and reflect conflict by general citizens. The paper deploys some theoretical constructs (such as imagination actions) to frame its - purposefully in large parts rather descriptive than analytic - presentation of this ongoing project.									0	0	0	0	0	1030-4312		WOS:000342288200002		
J	Young, Sandra								ENVISIONING THE PEOPLES OF 'NEW' WORLDS: EARLY MODERN WOODCUT IMAGES AND THE INSCRIPTION OF HUMAN DIFFERENCE								ENGLISH STUDIES IN AFRICA				57	1			33	54		10.1080/00138398.2014.916904			2014	2014	The woodcut images that were deployed within early geographies and on maps helped to establish the racialized imaginary within which the people of the south become known. One of the first sets of images of the peoples of Africa and the 'new' world was the series of woodcuts by Hans Burgkmair, published initially as an independent wall frieze (1508). Their reappearance within varied textual forms over the next century provides an intriguing case study of the impact of textual structure and context on imperialist intelligibility. Arranged within a single broadsheet, De Novo Mondo, the Burgkmair images helped to fuel a partisan ;new world' discourse and establish equivalences between regions of the global south, many of them long known to Europeans.									0	0	0	0	0	0013-8398		WOS:000342317400004		
J	James, Paul; Steger, Manfred B.								A Genealogy of 'Globalization': The Career of a Concept								GLOBALIZATIONS				11	4	SI		417	434		10.1080/14747731.2014.951186			2014	2014	Globalization' is an extraordinary concept. It is a complicated concept that burst upon the world relatively recently, but soon became a household concern. It is a concept that was rarely used until the 1990s, but processes of globalization had been happening for centuries. This article follows the genealogy of the concept from its unlikely beginnings in the 1930s-1950s to the heated scholarly debates across the end of the twentieth century to the present. Before it became a buzz word, the concept of globalization' began to be used in the most unlikely fields: in education to describe the global life of the mind; in international relations to describe the extension of the European Common Market; and in journalism to describe how the American Negro and his problem are taking on a global significance'. The article begins to answer the question Through what lineages and processes did the concept of globalization become so important?' Drawing on textual research and interviews with key originating figures in the field of global studies, the article attempts to get past the usual anecdotes about the formation and etymology of the concept that center on alleged inventors of the term or references to first use of globalization' various dictionaries. The article tracks the careers of major scholars in relation to the career of the concept. Abstracto de La Genealogia de las GlobalizacionGlobalizacion es un concepto extraordinario. Es un concepto complicado que irrumpio el mundo hace relativamente poco pero pronto se convirtio en una preocupacion de todos los hogares. Es un concepto que rara vez se usaba antes de 1990 si bien los procesos de globalizacion han venido sucediendo desde hace siglos. Este articulo hace seguimiento a la genealogia del concepto desde su poco probable comienzo en 1930-1950 hasta los acalorados debates academicos desde finales del siglo veinte hasta el presente. Antes de que se convirtiera en una palabra de moda, el concepto de globalizacion empezo a ser usado en los mas improbables gremios: en educacion para describir la vida global de la mente; en relaciones internacionales para describir la amplitud del Mercado Comun Europeo y en periodismo para describir como el Negro americano y sus problemas alcanzan una importancia global. El articulo comienza a contestar la pregunta Bajo que linaje y procesos fue que el concepto de globalizacion se convirtio en algo tan importante?. Basado en investigaciones de textos y con entrevistas con importantes personalidades en el campo de estudios globales, el articulo intenta sobrepasar las anecdotas sobre la formacion y la etimologia del concepto que se centran en supuestos inventores del termino o en referencias sobre el primer uso de globalizacion en diversos diccionarios. El articulo detalla la carrera de eruditos academicos en relacion con la carrera del concepto. ????????????????????,??????????,?????????20??90??,??????????,????????????????????????????,???????20??30-50?????????20?????????????????????????????????,?????????????????????????????;??????????????????;????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????,?????????????????,????????????,?????????????? ???? ???'??????'? ???? ????. ?CH??? ??? ??? ?? ??? ?????, ? ??? ???? ???. 1990?CH??? ?? ???? ?? ?????, ???? ??? ? ?? ?? ????. ? ??? ??? ??? 1930?CH-1950?CH ?? ? ?? ?? ?????? ??? ??? ??? ? 20?? ?? ???? ? ??? ??? ????. ???? ????? ?? ?? ???' ??? ??? ???? ???? ????: ???? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ????? ???? ????; ??????? ??????? ?CH? ???? ??? ??????; ??????? ??? ??? ? ??? ??? ??? ?? ?'? ???? ??? ??? ??? ?????.? ?? ?? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ???? ?????'?? ???

Historiography is thus problematized, rendering it a field of competing interpretations, relative to the play of gender, racial and colonial politics. This article explores how Kidman's narratology supports her fictional historiographic aims that are deployed towards feminist and postcolonial re-evaluations of the early settler history surrounding her protagonist Betty Guard.									0	0	0	0	0	1744-9855		WOS:000342317800009		
J	Tans, Olaf								The Imaginary Foundation of Legal Systems: A Mimetic Perspective								LAW & LITERATURE				26	2			127	143		10.1080/1535685X.2014.888204			2014	2014	Starting from the premise that the normative foundation of legal systems is widely considered to be imaginary, this article addresses the question how actors in those systems are able to experience this fictional basis and consider it binding. As the answers already given in legal and political philosophy tend to be limited to instrumental explanations, it is argued that insights from aesthetic philosophy, and more specifically mimesis theory, can help to gain a more profound understanding of both the nature of fictions and the human capacity to use them. Drawing from Kendall Walton's work, fiction use is reconceptualized as an interactive game of make-believe that has active and passive players, involves the use of props, and is governed by both constitutive and regulative rules. It is claimed that human beings are able to play and appreciate this game on the basis of a dual consciousness in which their minds are partly devoted to going along in the fiction of legal hegemony, and partly having to derivate experiences. Tentatively, it is argued that these derivate experiences form our main gratification, and hence the prime motive, for playing the game and accepting its outcomes.									0	0	0	0	0	1535-685X		WOS:000342292900001

Taking Christopher Small's writings as a point of departure, we contest his recently expressed view that music education should be taken out of schools, and lean on his concept of musicking to explain how school-based music education practices can be transformed from spaces dominated by enforced structural demands to spaces in which teachers and students engage in a joint exploration of musical identities, relationships and possibilities, and which then may provide something unique for the school culture to retain. Leading a discussion of how music teachers may reach the understanding of themselves as transformative intellectuals or change agents, and hence facilitate and lead such reconstructions of their own practices, we also attend to the frameworks of critical pedagogy and culturally responsive teaching.									0	0	0	0	0	1461-3808		WOS:000342322400002

Spivak's ideas of education 'to-come' as an 'un-coercive rearrangement of desires' towards an ethical imperative towards the Other, 'before will'. We start this article with a contextualization of the course and an outline the theoretical background that informed the course aims and strategies. Next, we selectively use affect theory to analyse the learning journals of eight students in the course. Our conclusion raises questions related to the relationship between structures of cognition, affect and relationality and highlights the role of crisis in learning processes that intend to equip learners to reconfigure their imaginaries and their capacity to relate to difference.									0	0	0	0	0	1361-3324		WOS:000342299300006		
J	Symons, Kate								Anti-politics, Apocalypse and Adaptation in Kenya's National Climate Change Response Strategy								SCOTTISH GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL				130	4			266	278		10.1080/14702541.2014.907442			2014	2014	Climate change is increasingly discussed in apocalyptic terms, a spectre-invoking crisis discourse that simultaneously legitimises society-wide action, while de-politicising this very political issue. This paper examines the depoliticisation of climate change adaptation in Kenya, a country which has been recently praised as a developing country with a progressive adaptation policy. Using examples from fieldwork in Kenya, it focusses on Kenya's recently adopted National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS), and argues that Kenya's adaptation discourse is driven by particular imaginaries, specifically: adaptation as a 'universal apocalypse', and adaptation as a technical-economic problem. These function as deliberate anti-political strategies, aimed at obscuring the highly charged realities of adaptation. For Kenya's current political elite adaptation is predominantly a matter of reducing the perceived risks to economic growth, and enhancing opportunities to gain revenue from international funding sources. This is achieved through a discursive construction of a particular vision of adaptation, and against a backdrop of a capitalist strategy for growth. The paper concludes that a critical and political interpretation of the NCCRS and similar adaptation strategies is necessary to keep equity and justice at the centre of the climate debate, and to dispel the myth of adaptation policy making as a rational and disinterested process.									0	0	0	0	0	1470-2541		WOS:000342309100004		
J	Gavreliuc, A.						Ionescu, S; Tomita, M; Cace, S		Resilient communities, historical trauma and narrative reconstruction of identity								SECOND WORLD CONGRESS ON RESILIENCE: FROM PERSON TO SOCIETY								703	709					2014	2014	In our research we have analysed 31 oral history interviews (1720 pages of transcript the manuscripts) as part of the documentary sources constituted by the Archive of the Group of Cultural Anthropology and Oral History of "The Third Europe Foundation", Timisoara, Romania. In the methodological design we have used a content analysis combined with values scale realized by M. Rokeach for a sample of subjects confronted with a traumatic event (deportation in the Second World War or in the Communist period). In the content analysis register we have indentified some constants of remembrances (the so-called discursive anchors) and the mechanisms of identitary discourses depending on certain imaginary nuclei of reference, grouped around the "family" symbolic anchor, which renders evident the social construction of identity. In the values scales register, out of over 2700 axiological references, we can distinguish the predominance of the values which would integrate in the register of "to be", to the detriment of the "to have" values. "Destiny", as well as "history", have deprived the investigated subjects of wealth, stability, social position, but all the existential breakings and all the discriminations they have lived are but the motives of a superior understanding of life, of the lasting and authentic friendships acquired, of the special achievements of their children. Therefore, these acquisitions in the register of "to be", which prove stronger than the misfortunes of fate, have activated the features of resilient communities.					2nd World Congress on Resilience / From Person to Society	MAY 08-10, 2014		Timisoara, ROMANIA	0	0	0	0	0		978-88-7587-697-5	WOS:000342208700133

In particular, we demonstrate how adults initiate imaginary transformations of objects while displaying an orientation to a general order of make-believe in which everyone has equal epistemic rights, and how this can be displayed both verbally and nonverbally. This distribution of equal rights is only overridden by external or locally derived roles, and once invoked they override the general preference for epistemic symmetry, after which interlocutors orient to establishing epistemic congruence, despite the obvious presence of epistemic asymmetry.									0	0	0	0	0	1878-9714		WOS:000342729900002		
J	Ngo Sheau-Shi								Nuxia: Historical Depiction and Modern Visuality								ASIAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES				20	3			7	26					2014	2014	Nuxia or woman warrior stands out as a term in the development of literature and cinema and is of particular interest for feminist concerns. Functioning as an archetype in ancient Chinese literature, the imaginary expression and fantastic representation of Nuxia in early Chinese cinema has reinvented itself in modern imagination to bridge symbolic and historical meaning. To explore further its figuration, both in literature and cinema, this essay seeks to demonstrate the connection between the cumulatively historical depictions of Nuxia and its continuously shifting meanings in cinema. I argue here that the visual properties of the classic heroic heritage of Nuxia served as a link between modern rationalism and the traditional imaginary, which not only informs so much of the contemporary meaning and significance of the terminology, but also situates this specific woman warrior archetype beyond the framework of sexual difference.									0	0	0	0	0	1225-9276		WOS:000342788700001

My focus is the imperial middlemen or intermediaries who became astonishingly loyal to the core. This loyalty was ensured not through circulation of officials across the different parts of the empire, but through asymmetrical contracting, various strategies of control, binding and pivoting of local elites. The professionalization of civil servants involved much continuity with the old landowning and noble-elite and ensured that corruption, deceit or local autonomy movements could be sanctioned quickly. There was nothing inevitable in the fall of the Danish empire and its transformation into a rump nation-state. Instead, imperial rule was a dominant imaginary within which almost all protest against absolutist power took place right up until the Napoleonic wars.									0	0	0	0	0	0020-577X		WOS:000342886500003		
J	Popovic, Virginia								LINKS BETWEEN SCIENCE AND POETRY IN THE WORKS OF THE ROMANIAN POET ION BARBU. MATHEMATICS AS A GAME								ALEA-ESTUDOS NEOLATINOS				16	1			169	178					JAN-JUN 2014	2014	The paper explores and analyzes the influences of game and mathematical symbols on the poetry of the Romanian modern poet Ion Barbu. The paper presents the analysis of the theories of game as a poetic art as well as the analysis of the links between science and poetry in the works of Ion Barbu - links which led to the conclusion that his poetry is imbued with mathematical symbols. This was the reason why literary critics reviewed his work as original and a novelty in Romanian literature. Poet and mathematician Ion Barbu (Dan Barbilian) became known as one of the most significant modern poets of Romania, Barbus' lyric went not only through different phases distinct by various specific representations, but it also went through language modifications. Thus the motive of the game which we encounter in Barbu's poetry changes according to the literary phase through which the poet goes. The analysis of game as ars poetica by critics and other foreign and Romanian researchers represents the point of departure of this paper while the goal of this research is to identify those components which demonstrate that game is not only a cultural and literary topic but also a way of life. Literature itself is a game of time and space, a game of different eras and fashions. Poetry is a game of words and a creator of a fascinating imaginary and complex space. Life unfolds within the space of an intellectual game, in a world created by the mind where things are different from those in real life and linked with links other than the logical ones. Game is thus an element that belongs within the field of poetry and every poetic form seems closely tied to the structure of the game.									0	0	0	0	0	1517-106X		WOS:000343025600012

What are the political implications of this imaginary? What are the absences, the residues, the invisibilised practices and actors of technoscience's ontological politics? The paper interrogates this form of politics, argues for the radical democratisation of technoscience and explores how it is possible to pose questions of justice without reducing the material to the social. It concludes with a discussion of the idea of crafting alternative ontologies as commitment to a material organisation of justice.									1	0	0	0	1	0269-1728		WOS:000343205900006

J	Ruethers, Monica								From the "Fiddler on the Roof" to the "Gypsy Kings" Jews and the Roma/Gypsies in the European Topography of Memory								JAHRBUCHER FUR GESCHICHTE OSTEUROPAS				62	1			89	112					2014	2014	Jews and Gypsies are marginal men in the cultural topographies of Europe. During the past 25 years, both minorities underwent a process of festivalization. Jewish Culture Festivals and Klezmer music as well as Gypsy Music Festivals and Balkan Beats became highly popular. Jewish and Gypsy spaces were established and serve as tourist borderzones for the encounters of "Europeans" with their exoticized Other. A new European folklore emerges, successfully blending kitsch and terror, remembrance and the romanticized nomadism of post-modern lifestyles. Two case studies of the Jewish Culture Festival in Kazimierz and the Gypsy pilgrimage to Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer reveal telling asymmetries. After 1989, the imaginary Jews were located in the former Jewish districts of Central European cities such as Cracow, Prague and Budapest or Czernowitz. The Holocaust became the foundation of a common European culture of remembrance, a new European tradition. Gypsies are revered as musicians, yet reviled as people. The very same regions of Jewish encoded "Central Europe" shifted eastward on the mental maps as soon as the Roma were concerned. Europeans are in fear of a Roma "invasion" from the East. The European ambivalence towards its Others is symptomatic of a community striving to imagine itself. In this process, to have or have not a common European history plays a pivotal role. The imaginary Jews seem to embody a common multicultural "European" past, whilst the Roma "come from India". They are represented as belly-dancing Orientals and used for drawing boundaries excluding non-Europeans.									0	0	0	0	0	0021-4019		WOS:000343525000004

It is, I will claim, a fundamental thesis in his philosophy inasmuch as it enables him to unveil and even radicalize the modem crisis and to pose a crucial ethical problem: if reason is not guaranteed and has to arise perilously from irrational depths, the self is threatened by inauthenticity, illusion and alienation; the existence is a strange dream which may anytime turn into a nightmare. I will also show that Merleau-Ponty reverses this crisis into an asset: a reality which includes a fundamental dimension of imaginary leaves us free to create new metamorphoses.									0	0	0	0	0	0046-385X		WOS:000344443700007

J	Nikolaidou-Arabatzi, Smaro								MAIDEN CHORUSES IN THE EPINICIAN ODES OF PINDAR AND BACCHYLIDES: POET'S CHORAL 'I'								QUADERNI URBINATI DI CULTURA CLASSICA				106	1			33	50					2014	2014	First-person statements in epinician odes have caused vivid discussion on either the monodic or choral character of the real performance, also involving the identity of the celebrating komos (Lefkowitz; Lefkowitz-Heath; Burnett; Carey; Morgan; Robbins). This paper argues for a Choral 'I' of the poet by considering the function of maiden-choruses descriptions in the context and purpose of the epinician poetry. The parthenoi choruses have been studied as a pattern of choral projection in Bacchylides' 13 (Power); but the choral character of the performance of the epinikion is taken there for granted.The paper examines selected passages from the epinician odes of Pindar and Bacchylides in which imaginary choruses of parthenoi, mythically known as dancing, function as a ritual prototype that enriches the laudatory logos with choral excitement. In the Pindaric odes, in particular, it is the divine groups of the Muses or the Graces that are mostly depicted as dancing. In these instances they stand as exemplary komoi (in the komos vocabulary) that link the encomiastic strategy of the poet with ideal dancing.I propose that in the epinician odes first-person statements move between two levels: the first level concerns the poet's official duty to highlight the success of the honored person (poet's praising 'I'); the second level is about his awareness to compose an ode of analogous but not informal choral excitement with the celebrating community (poet's choral 'I'). Thus, while composing his ode, the epinician poet feels as if leading himself a professional chorus and, without disturbing praise, he plans khoreia elements on an imaginary level, regardless of the character monodic or choral of the real performance. Pindar, especially, 'the professional' (Morgan) authorizes the choral reception of the epinikion by projecting to the dance of divinities who inspire the poet.									0	0	0	0	0	0033-4987		WOS:000344214600003		
J	Rossolatos, George								A methodological framework for projecting brand equity: Putting back the imaginary into brand knowledge structures								SIGN SYSTEMS STUDIES				42	1			98	136					2014	2014	The aim of this paper is to outline a methodological framework for brand equity planning with structuralist rhetorical semiotics. By drawing on the connectionist conceptual model of the brand generative trajectory of signification it will be displayed in a stepwise fashion how a set of nuclear semes and classemes or an intended semic structure that underlies manifest discursive structures may be projected by its internal stakeholders (i.e., a brand management team, an account planning team or a marketing research team) with view to attaining differential brand associations. The suggested methodological framework focuses on the strength and uniqueness of brand associations as integral aspects of a brand's equity structure and comprises a set of calculi that aim at addressing from a brand textuality point of view how associations may be systematically linked to their key sources with an emphasis on the ad filmic text. The propounded methodology is exemplified by recourse to a corpus of ad filmic texts from the major brand players in the UK cereals market. The argumentative thrust is intent on demonstrating that structuralist rhetorical semiotics is not only useful for analysing/interpreting brand texts, but, moreover, for constructing and for managing them over time. This demonstration is deployed by adopting a synchronic/diachronic and intra-(ad)-filmic/inter-(ad)-filmic approach to the formation of brand associations that make up a projected brand equity structure, in the context of embedded product category dynamics.									0	0	0	0	0	1406-4243		WOS:000344981300005

While being unified in an Arabic-speaking Levantine identity, on the one hand, and conscious of their Ottoman affiliation, on the other, the authors came from decidedly different social, religious, and occupational backgrounds. Given the unity and diversity of the backgrounds of the authors, this essay examines the consequent tensions found in each author's spatial vision. By plotting and juxtaposing these authors' horizons into maps and graphs, both the differing and overlapping concepts of geographical identities are visualized. In a pre-national age, when the state's intervention in creating a territory-bounded identity was minimal, did eighteenth-century Ottoman Levantines live in the same world?									0	0	0	0	0	0255-0636		WOS:000344980500016		
J	Arthurson, Kathy; Darcy, Michael; Rogers, Dallas								Televised territorial stigma: how social housing tenants experience the fictional media representation of estates in Australia								ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A				46	6			1334	1350		10.1068/a46136			2014	2014	This paper explores the issue of territorial stigmatisation through tenant-driven research chronicling the experiences of social housing tenants as they examined and reflected upon the Australian television series Housos. The television series aired on an independent, part publicly funded, television station in 2011 and depicts the lifestyles of fictional tenant characters on an imaginary social housing estate. The series presents satirical and exaggerated parodies about everyday life on the estate, drawing on a range of stereotypes of social housing tenants. Tenants are portrayed as feckless and antisocial individuals who engage in a range of irresponsible and sometimes criminal behaviour in order to avoid work and whose family and other relationships are dysfunctional. Public tenants are far from passive victims of stigmatisation and conducted the analysis presented in this study. They reveal a sophisticated understanding of how stigma operates through the media, various agencies, and the nonresident community. While economic and political forces, and changing modes for governing poverty, have resulted in geographical confinement of residents on estates, tenants reflected on their own 'real-life' experiences and provide accounts of deliberate and self-conscious use of 'negative' social status to produce positive collective identities. Alternatively, nontenant participants repeated common prejudices about public housing, and reflected on their belief that the system was not effectively preventing welfare cheats and 'bludgers' from loafing at their (taxpayers') expense.									1	0	0	0	1	0308-518X		WOS:000345691600007

J	Harrison, John; Growe, Anna								When regions collide: in what sense a new 'regional problem'?								ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A				46	10			2332	2352		10.1068/a130341p			2014	2014	Going beyond the territorial/relational divide in regional studies requires researchers to do more than examine the extent to which territoriality and relationality are complementary alternatives. The variety of networked regional spaces means it is intellectually unsustainable to simply relate a single networked regional space to territory-scale without first considering how networked regional spaces interact. Illustrated through the experience of Germany, our paper demonstrates that interaction between different networked regional spaces (eg, city-regions and cross-border regions) is resulting in new networked regional imaginaries (eg, cross-border metropolitan regions). Its overall aim is to show that the production of entirely new networked spaces can assist in overcoming the contradictions present in one configuration of regions, but this only serves to create a new 'regional problem' requiring ever more complex configurations of regions.									0	0	0	0	0	0308-518X		WOS:000345694200007		
J	Khayyat, Yasmine								Southern Counterpublics: The Poetics and Politics of South Lebanon's Ruinscapes								JOURNAL OF ARABIC LITERATURE				45	2-3			169	217		10.1163/1570064x-12341284			2014	2014	This article explores the commemorative poetics of Shu'ara al-januh, a group of South I.,ebanese poets who interpellated the classical Arabic tradition of ruin-gazing known as a/-a//at (stopping at the ruins) into their laments over Israel's protracted occupation of South Lebanon (1978-2(mo) as well as their marginalized positioning within the nation's literary landscape. I argue that Siniarci' atjanah can be seen as creating "counterpublics," a new texture of memory expressive of an understudied swathe of I.,ebanon's population that faced occupation and neglect on the literary, national and humanitarian front. Aro', ailanab (the southern earth) stands in for the pre Islamic tala/ (ruined site), gripping the imaginative poetics of its memory practitioners who conceive of the land as a repository for their personal and collective memories of forced migration and war. Rather than the gasaialt's amorous site of return, however, the ruined southern landscape is reconfigured as an impossible port of entry and tmwelcoming host to war. South Lebanon's recurring seasons and cycles of war and occupation place it in a blind spot of -historical and cultural memory for the larger part of its occupation. By imbricating ruins and memory into their poetic meditations on the deformation of this once enchanted landscape they called home, Shu'ara' allanab attempt to reposition the South as not a liminal space in the nation's cultural imaginary, but rather a deeply central one by calling into question issues of belonging, war and the art(ifice) of commemoration. By delving into this rural periphery, I examine its separate fate from the rest of the nation through its poetic landscapes of war. I argue that this new school of poetry entwines the performance of returning to and beholding ruined spaces with a critical and political form of witness. The sometimes spectral, sometimes enchanted and sometimes scarred poetic landscapes of Shu'ara suture together a discourse that galvanizes nature, memory, myth and pre-Islamic motifs into a counterpublic discourse that sits in uneasy tension with the historical context of war and occupation.									0	0	0	0	0	0085-2376		WOS:000345911400002		
J	Castro Castro, Luis								Imaginaries and Chilenization: Chilean State Agents and their Vision of the Andean Space and Population of the Tarapaca Province, Northern Chile 1880-1918								ANUARIO DE ESTUDIOS AMERICANOS				71	2			661	690		10.3989/aeamer.2014.2.10			2014	2014	In the 1880's, the Chilean state annexed the province of Tarapaca into its jurisdiction. This gave rise to a complex process known as chilenization. In this context, Chilean state officials implemented political, economic and cultural devices with the purpose of establishing rapidly the new administration, and transforming this territory and its population into a part of the Chilean nation. Consequently, this article describes and analyzes the imaginary of the Andean space and population, belonging to the Tarapaca province, created by these state agents between the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century.									0	0	0	0	0	0210-5810		WOS:000345920700010

Despite this high level of use, less research has examined the interaction between adolescent development and use of social networking sites. Thus, the present study seeks to understand the relationship between adolescents' Facebook use and their experience of a developmental construct, Imaginary Audience. Using survey data collected from 260 participants between the ages of 9 and 26, results suggested a positive relationship between Facebook use and Imaginary Audience ideation. Furthermore, to better understand this relationship, behavioral rehearsal was tested as a mediating variable. Results were supportive of this mediator. The present study was limited in two main ways: First, given the cross-sectional survey design, we were unable to make causal claims from our data. Second, the sample was predominantly homogenous in nature. Despite these limitations, however, the implications of these findings are twofold: First, this research indicates that Facebook use is related to characteristics of adolescent development. Future research should continue to examine this relationship pattern. Second, by connecting the study of media behaviors and developmental theory, we call attention to a timely and fruitful avenue for the interdisciplinary study of developmental phenomena and media.									0	0	0	0	0	1864-1105		WOS:000346112100001

The focus will be on the understanding of modern and heritage urban landscapes, and their interactions as a products of creative activity between man, space and time. The questions were razed upon persevering historic landscapes in urban environments and understanding spirit of the place and time. In this context it is proposed landscape architecture approach to urban heritage conservation. The study of the spatial imagery is based on the evaluation of its historical and cultural values through analysis of landscape qualities. The proposed approach has been applied on the cultural urban landscape of the city of Nis, Serbia, using as a reference historic sites and contemporary comprehension in using them as primary expression of identity. In creation of cultural urban landscape, general inquiry has been conducted on the topological level through history, art and culture of Ancient, Byzantine and Ottoman city of Nis. As a result of the analysis, the potential of the historic site of the Fortress built in 18 th century at the place of Roman castrum, has been reconsidered in correlation to the belonging urban and natural environment, what gave the guidelines for future sustainable development of the city. Historic time in space and space in time, is an urban texture, becoming the focal point for future enrichment of urban life.					12th International Forum of Studies -The Paths of the Merchants	JUN 12-14, 2014	Seconda Univ Studi Napoli; Dipartimento Architettura & Disegno Industriale; Benecon Knowledge Network; Topcon; Unione Italiana Disegno; Forum UNESCO; United Nat Educ, Sci & Cultural Org, Commissione Nazionale Italiana; US Italy Fulbright Commiss Linking Minds Across Cultures	Aversa, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0		978-88-6542-347-9	WOS:000346372100072		
J	Hepworth, Kate								Enacting logistical geographies								ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY & SPACE				32	6			1120	1134		10.1068/d13044p			2014	2014	This paper outlines how logistics enacts geographies of rationalisation and optimisation. It begins with the messiness and tensions embodied in the encounter between the ideal, logistical city and the lived spaces of a particular no longer industrial city. The logistical city is not understood as a material space; it is an assemblage of practices and interventions that have as their aim the efficient and productive flow of commodities into, out of, and through urban space. As an assemblage, the logistical city embeds particular localities in material, discursive, and symbolic relations that link them to more or less distant sites and jurisdictions. In moving between the material and imagined geographies of logistics, the paper considers how these imaginaries legitimise particular interventions and practices in those sites, rendering others invisible or illegitimate. These interventions into lived space are considered relative to a single city-Sydney-with a focus on the Port Botany container terminals.									0	0	0	0	0	0263-7758		WOS:000346163600011

J	Chiriac, Horia-Costin						Sandu, A; Frunza, AC		Descriptive Imaginary and the Epistemological Profile of Modern Social Sciences								LUMEN 2014 - FROM THEORY TO INQUIRY IN SOCIAL SCIENCES		Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences		149				169	173		10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.08.182			2014	2014	In the present paper we intend to introduce the concept of descriptive imaginary, which designates a special type of scientific imaginary, as an investigative tool regarding the epistemological profile of social sciences. The concept is partially originated in the terminology of the French School of History and Anthropology in which important contributors are Gilbert Durand, Jacques Le Goff, Jean Jacques Wunenburger and others. We are going to distinguish descriptive imaginary from other types of imaginary, like artistic imaginary or religious imaginary and to emphasize its role in the development of natural sciences, but also of social sciences as well. As far as imagination is concerned, it had a rather difficult relation with philosophy, including epistemology and philosophy of science. Thus, it is mandatory to justify the use of the term "imaginary" in relation to the epistemological profile of various scientific disciplines. But some of the old prejudices regarding the contribution of imaginative faculty to scientific progress seem to be abandoned nowadays. At least, the productive imagination was finally distinguished from the reproductive one. Moreover, in spite of the fact that human imagination can produce a wide range of fictional entities, its partial use within the scientific descriptive effort regarding the characteristics of nature can be put into evidence, provided the use of imaginative faculty within the limits of rationality with a deep focus on the plausibility of descriptions. An important ingredient in this case is represented by specific criteria for selecting viable descriptive representations used in the development of scientific theories. We are going to study some crucial points in the historical evolution of natural sciences and social sciences, aiming to emphasize some intriguing similarities but also some disparities among them, in order to unveil the specificity of modern social sciences as far as the methodological road from Theory to Inquiry in their case is concerned. The case of sociology, which was born as "social physics" seems to be emblematic in this respect. In the end, we are going to develop a possible explanation for the presence of some methodological elements in the epistemological profile of modern social sciences that consolidate their status as modern sciences.

In the past few decades, references to the latino invasion and the fear of a reconquest of US territory by the Mexican hordes have entered the American collective imaginary. At the same time, north of the Canadian/US border, Quebec nationalism, which is perceived as a threat to Canadian unity, became a major issue. This article focuses on how the Quebec metaphor is used in the United States to strengthen an anti-Mexican discourse.									0	0	0	0	0	0007-7720		WOS:000347230800006

J	Markham, Tim								Social media, protest cultures and political subjectivities of the Arab spring								MEDIA CULTURE & SOCIETY				36	1			89	104		10.1177/0163443713511893			JAN 2014	2014	This article draws on phenomenological perspectives to present a case against resisting the objectification of cultures of protest and dissent. The generative, self-organizing properties of protest cultures, especially as mobilized through social media, are frequently argued to elude both authoritarian political structures and academic discourse, leading to new political subjectivities or 'imaginaries'. Stemming from a normative commitment not to over-determine such nascent subjectivities, this view has taken on a heightened resonance in relation to the recent popular uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa. The article argues that this view is based on an invalid assumption that authentic political subjectivities and cultures naturally emerge from an absence of constraint, whether political, journalistic or academic. The valorization of amorphousness in protest cultures and social media enables affective and political projection, but overlooks politics in its institutional, professional and procedural forms.									1	0	0	0	1	0163-4437		WOS:000346661700007		
J	Morales, Margaret del Carmen; Harris, Leila; Oeberg, Gunilla								Citizenshit: the right to flush and the urban sanitation imaginary								ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A				46	12			2816	2833		10.1068/a130331p			2014	2014	For many in the Global North, urban life means that your shit is not your problem. We postulate that a possible reason for the global sanitation failure in urban areas is a disconnect between sanitation expectations-what we term the urban sanitation imaginary-and the practices required by proposed sanitation solutions. The case study presented here is based on interviews with residents of Villa Lamadrid, a marginalized neighborhood in Buenos Aires, Argentina, which faces significant public health impacts from an inadequate sewage management system. We solicited feedback regarding specific sanitation technologies frequently prescribed for poor urban communities-among them a urine diversion dry toilet with dehydration vaults. Even as this system is posited as 'sustainable' for the context of Villa Lamadrid in terms of ecological and economic factors, conversations with residents revealed why this option might not be sustainable in terms of social expectations. On the basis of interviews with community members we have defined four aspects of residents' urban sanitation imaginaries that we consider highly relevant for any consideration of sanitation solutions in this context: (1) an urban citizen does not engage physically or mentally with their shit or its management; (2) an appropriate urban sanitation system requires flushing; (3) systems that require user's engagement with their shit and its management signify rural, underdeveloped, and backward lifestyles; and (4) urban sanitation is a state responsibility, not a local one. Highlighting the urban sanitation imaginary methodologically and analytically goes beyond a discussion of culturally and contextually appropriate technologies. It examines linkages between user expectations and notions of urban citizenship and modernity. Ultimately it also draws attention to the sociopolitical dynamics and environmental justice issues embedded in discussions of sanitation and hygiene. While some of our results are specific to the Villa Lamadrid context, our research more generally suggests the need to consider sanitation imaginaries to reframe the discussion on sanitation interventions, particularly in underserved and impoverished urban areas.									0	0	0	0	0	0308-518X		WOS:000347381700004

J	Chang, Shin-Shin; Chang, Chung-Chau; Chien, Ya-Lan; Chang, Jung-Hua								Having champagne without celebration? The impact of self-regulatory focus on moderate incongruity effect								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING				48	11-12			1939	1961		10.1108/EJM-07-2012-0388			2014	2014	Purpose - This research aims to analyze whether the self-regulatory focus, a consumer variable, moderates the impact of incongruity on consumer evaluations. A congruity or typicality arises when a product (e.g. champagne) is consistently consumed in certain occasions or is used in conjunction with other specific products. This typicality may remind people of the product with regard to specific contexts but may limit the product's overall versatility. In line with the moderate incongruity effect, there may be an opportunity to extend a product usage to situations associated with moderate incongruity or atypicality.Design/methodology/approach - Study 1 is a 2 (self-regulatory focus: promotion/prevention) x 3 (atypicality of product usage context: typical/moderately atypical/highly atypical) between-subject experimental design. Study 2 replicated Study 1 with a sample of different age, three different champagne usage contexts and a manipulation of self-regulatory focus. Study 3 is a 2 (self-regulatory focus: promotion/prevention) x 3 (atypicality of product usage context: typical/moderately atypical/ highly atypical) x 2 (product replicates: red wine/pearl jewelry) mixed design with self-regulatory focus and atypicality as between-subjects factors and product replicates as a within-subject variable.Findings - Promotion-focus consumers' product evaluations for the moderate incongruity or atypicality are higher than those for congruity and extreme incongruity. The relationship takes an inverted-U shape. Prevention-focus consumers' product evaluations decrease monotonically as congruity decreases. Moreover, compared with prevention-focus individuals, promotion-focus ones evaluate moderate incongruity more favorably.Research limitations/implications - There are some limitations to this research. First, it only investigates the moderate incongruity effect with regard to product use occasions and complementary products. To increase the external validity of self-regulatory focus as a moderator of incongruity-evaluation relationships, it remains to future research to extend the research setting to products which have been tightly bonded to specific users, locations, seasons or times. Second, although the experimental designs are similar to previous ones, the scenarios are nevertheless imaginary. Therefore, participants' involvement levels in all manipulated situations, as well as the quality of their answers, remain unknown.Practical implications - First, brand managers should target only promotion-focus customers to obtain the moderate incongruity effect, but should maintain a consistent marketing strategy for prevention-focus customers. Second, because both promotion-and prevention-focus individuals have unfavorable evaluations of extreme incongruity, drastic changes in marketing strategies should be avoided. Third, people from a Western (Eastern) culture exhibit more promotion (prevention) focus orientation. Therefore, the type of culture can serve as an indicator of regulatory orientation. Fourth, a gain-framed appeal is recommended for realizing the moderate incongruity effect from promotion-focus consumers. Finally, promotion-focus (vs prevention-focus) consumers will welcome a moderately nonalignable than alignable product upgrade.Originalityvalue - Most prior research on goal orientation has found that promotion-focus (vs. prevention-focus) individuals are more inclined to adopt new products, but both types of people are unlikely to purchase new products when the associated risks become salient, while the research related to schema incongruity has suggested that the moderate incongruity effect may not exist when consumers perceive high risks. By combining both schema congruity and self-regulatory focus theories, this research provides a more precise picture of how and why a person's goal orientation influences the relative salience of risks and benefits with an increase in incongruity.									0	0	0	0	0	0309-0566		WOS:000347715700002

While the protestant tradition still valorized the myth of the self-made man, conformity dictated their everyday lives. Man had to prove his masculinity through financial success, but at the same time they were expected to be family-oriented, kind, and understandingto have traditionally “feminine” qualities. The Shrinking Man is Matheson’s sarcastic but not unsympathetic commentary on the organization man’s attempt to find imaginary solutions to his perceived masculinity in crisis. In the first part of the essay, the double structure of the novela narrative of the past, from week 1 to week 64, and a narrative of the present, the week 72is examined in relation to these separate spaces. The narrative of the past shows Scott’s conformist life on the surface, while the narrative of the present reveals his subterranean life where he fulfills his individualistic, masculine dream. The structure helps the novel keep its distance from Scott Carey’s “heroic” achievement in the basement and underlines the irony in his reclaimed masculinity, which is considered in the second part of the essay.									0	0	0	0	0	1738-5784		KJD:ART001897919		
J	장석호								Study on The Hybrid Figures in the Prehistoric and Ancient Arts			선사 및 고대 미술 속 하이브리드 형상 연구					CENTRAL ASIAN STUDIES	중앙아시아연구			19	1			1	34					2014	2014	"Hybrid Figure" is a term used for describing compounds of different kinds and species such as two animals or an animal and human. Hybrid Figure is one of the most interesting things from the ancient or prehistoric arts. This study is to examine the Hybrid Figures, and to classify materials by observing canons of models, and to find out what these embodied. To do these things, we have observed a total of 69 Hybrid Figures. Through this, hybrid forms have been observed in the entire region, made in the stone age. Even now, they have remained as an important position of ruins. The main components of the Hybrid Figures are generally animals' horns; ears and tails including legs of human. In other words, head of animals, which don't have horns or humans are combined with horns and ears; tails of deer or cattle or goats. If this is not the case, human bodies are combined with birds or the symbol of the sun. Among 69 of the Hybrid Figures, 51 of the Hybrid Figures are the compounds of human and animals or symbols, which are 73% of the total amounts. From that, 52% is the compounds of humans and animals, which is 36. The mixture of birds and humans are 5, which is 7.2% of the total amount. Sun and human are all 6, which is 8.6%. The compounds of animals are 15, which is 21.7%. We can classify those things like one that is combined with animals' head and human bodies; one that is combined with "imaginary animals" that is made up of all kinds of animals and human's legs, and one that is combined with humans' head and animals' body. We can classify the compounds of human and birds as a mixture of birds' head and bodies of human or humans' head and birds' bodies. For the compounds of the sun and human, it can be distinguished by one that is made up of a shiny head and human bodies, and one that is mixed with concentric circles and human bodies. Also, mixtures of animals can be classified as animals that basically don't have horns, but have cattle or deer's horn on their bodies; mixtures of birds and animals, those of fishes and birds' wings; those of reptile and horns on their head. From those things, we can call the mixture of animals' head and human legs "Minotauros Type." For the animals that is combined with birds' wings can be called "Griffin Type." Human faces with birds' wings are called "Siren Type." There are diverse opinions on these things like the Figures of God, God of Hunting, the Leader of Tribes, Hunters, and Shamans. Obviously, part of these figures are not only Hunters, but also Shamans. The rest of them are embodied for the figures of the God of Sun. Groups of manufacturing selected the animals part, which has a special ability, and give shape to the ideal creature. The completed figures of all these things are called "Dragons."									0	0	0	0	0	1738-0200		KJD:ART001891348		
J	Woo, Miseong								Exoticism, Fin de Siecle, and Representation of Asian Women in Late Nineteenth-Century Western Culture: Pierre Loti’s Madame Chrysantheme								COMPARATIVE LITERATURE	비교문학			63				241	262					2014	2014	This article is a study of the origin and the historical development of the Madame Butterfly narrative as the dominant representation of Asian women in Western culture, which was part of the cultural apparatus of nineteenth-century exoticism and fin-de-siecle. The popular Western opera’s favorite theme about the East, the interracial romance, found its origin in the French operas Lakme and Madame Chrysantheme. Pierre Loti’s romance novel, Madame Chrysantheme (1887), is the progenitor of the Butterfly narrative as it is a tragic romance between a white man and an Asian woman. Nominally, the center of the travelogue is a firsthand look at different people and customs. However, the reality of the Eastern locale did not concern Loti, who associated the exotic with escape, and this phenomenon applied to his racial and sexual preconceptions as well. In this regard, the real protagonist in Loti’s novels is himself, a man who uses Asian women as a means of self-aggrandizement. Several biographers and Loti scholars have written that the writer was a homosexual who perpetrated a heterosexual myth upon his reading public. Exotic writings, including Loti’s romance novels, were born as a revolt or as romantic and sexual escapism against the rigid state control and social anxiety at the turn of the twentieth century in Europe. The imaginary world of Loti’s male fantasy, intermingled with exoticism, has romanticized and mystified the Western view of East Asian countries as well as Asian women. It is historical irony and misfortune that one of the most enduring cultural images of Asian women in Western culture originated out of the wedlock of escapist sentiment of fin-de-siecle and exoticism.									0	0	0	0	0	1225-0910		KJD:ART001895307		
J	주지영								Appearance of self –identification of subject in 1960's novel - Lee Cheong-Jun and Choe in-hun's novels -			1960년대 소설에 나타난 주체의 자기동일화 양상- 이청준 문학과 최인훈 문학을 중심으로 -					DONAM OHMUNHAK	돈암어문학			27				91	111					2014	2014	Among 1960's novel, Lee Cheong-Jun and Choe in-hun's novels have destroyed the traditional narrative structure. The works of two writers criticize the contradiction of 1960's social symbolic systems and desire for the imaginary identification. These works destroy the traditional narrative structure by combining the signifiant of such desire through metaphor and metonymy. Due to the signifiant of desire for the imaginary identification, Two writers are distinct from each other. Lee Cheong-Jun's works substitute the signifiant of desire to the custom of 'Namdo'. Meanwhile, Choe in-hun's works substitute the signifiant of desire to the sea, namely the basic home of humankind. By each methods, two writers attempt self -identification of subject. For this reason, narrative structure of each work is decided. Each work metonymically combines narrative of desire related to the imaginary identification with narrative related to criticism on the symbolic systems. At the same time, metaphor-substitution comes true in each narrative. In Lee Cheong-Jun's works, the imaginary identification and criticism on the symbolic systems are connected by concrete reality. On the other hand, Choe in-hun's works partake strongly the aspect of abstractness. In Choe in-hun's works, the desire of the imaginary identification is substituted by the abstract human- civilization unlike Lee Cheong-Jun's works.				1960년대 소설과 관련해 볼 때, 이청준과 최인훈의 소설은 전통 서사구조를 파괴하고 있다는 공통점을 지닌다. 최인훈과 이청준 문학은 1960년대 사회적 상징체계의 모순을 비판하고 상상계적 동일성의 세계를 욕망하면서, 그러한 무의식의 욕망의 기표를 은유적이고 환유적으로 결합시킴으로써 전통서사구조를 파괴하고 있는 것이다. 두 작가는 상상계적 동일화에 대한 욕망의 기표가 갖는 특질에서 구분된다. 이청준은 ‘남도의 고향’으로 표상되는 풍속의 세계를 욕망의 기표로 설정하고, 최인훈은 ‘바다’로 표상되는 인류의 원초적 고향과 관련된 세계를 욕망의 기표로 설정해, 새로운 주체의 자기동일화를 꾀하려 한다. 이러한 방법론에 따라 이청준 문학과 최인훈 문학의 서사 구조도 결정된다. (A) 상상계적 동일화와 관련된 욕망의 서사와 (B) 상징계 비판과 관련된 서사가 환유 결합되면서 전통 서사구조는 파괴된다. 이와 동시에, 각각의 서사 내에서 은유 대체가 일어난다. 곧 상상계적 동일화와 관련된 욕망의 기표가 은유 대체되고, 더불어 상징계 비판과 관련된 현실적 기표가 은유 대체된다. 그러나 상상계적 동일화와 상징계 비판이 상징계의 구체적 현실과 연결되어 있는 이청준 문학과 달리 최인훈 문학은 추상적인 측면을 강하게 띠고 있다. 이는 최인훈 문학에 나타나는 상상계적 동일화에 대한 욕망이 이청준 문학과는 달리 추상적인 인류 문명 일반으로 은유 대체된다는 점과 관련이 있다.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-2117		KJD:ART001944306

J	SOU, MOUN JEAN; 이상민								The possibility of the interpretation in the clinical philosophy about Jackson's uncontested principle			잭슨의 논란 없는 원리에 대한 임상철학적 해석 가능성					Journal of the Daedong Philosophical Association	대동철학			67				199	227					2014	2014	Jackson's uncontested principle((AC) (A⊃C)) is among heated controversy between domestic scholars like Lee Byungduk, Song Hasuk, Choi Wonbae and Yang Eunsuk from 2008 to nowadays. However, they do not agreed with the problem. So we coworkers would like to argue that we can explain the source of this disagreed in the view of the clinical philosophy. According to Lacan, a true scholar is a person comprising the hysteric discourse rather than the university discourse. In this sense, Zizek has mentioned before that Kant and Hegel are the constructors of the hysteric discourse in the most sublime sense. We would like to attempt to demonstrate that the controversy over Jackson's uncontested principle emerging in the domestic academy is very close to the structure of the hysteric discourse. Yet we have our own inherent position. The thesis is very simple. If the meaning of the indicative conditional is to be explained by the true-functional condition, Jackson's uncontested principle comes into existence without any dispute. Therefore, the criticism given to Lee Byungduk by Song Hasuk, Choi Wonbae and Yang Eunsuk etc. is valid. However, if it supports that the truth condition of the indicative conditional has the weaker truth condition than that of the material conditional or it supports like Edgington that the meaning of the indicative conditional is irrelevant to any kind of the true-functional condition, Lee Byungduk's argument can be accepted too. In the long run, whether or not the uncontested principle may be possible depends on the semantics of the conditionals. But in this case, the meaning could be discussed on various levels. For example, we can distinct the meaning of linguistical dimension(de dicto) from that of the object(de re). In the latter, according to a speaker, the same term of love can mean 'the source of tears' on the one hand and 'the eternal life' on the other. All this argument would lead us to justification of our own thesis: each logical justification depends on the psychological belief that he has. For the object that we want to catch is some thing revolving between the real, imaginary and symbolic, and does not allow us to define clearly.				잭슨(Jackson)의 ‘논란 없는 원리’(uncontested principle)(직설법적 조건문(AC)과 질료적 조건문(A⊃C) 사이의 함축 관계를 표현한 식, 즉 ‘(AC) (A⊃C)’에 대한 논쟁은 2008년에서 현재까지 상당히 긴 시간 동안 국내의 대표적인 논리학자들, 이병덕, 송하석, 최원배, 양은석 등을 중심으로 이어지고 있다. 그럼에도 그들 사이에는 의견의 불일치가 여전히 남아 있는 것으로 보인다. 이에 필자는 이러한 의견의 불일치의 근거를 임상 철학적 관점에서 분석할 수 있는 가능성을 해명하고자 한다. 라캉에 따르면, 진정한 학자는 대학의 담론을 구성하는 자라기보다는 히스테리 담론을 구성하는 자이다. 이런 의미에서 지젝은 칸트나 헤겔을 가장 숭고한 의미의 히스테리 담론의 구성자라고 언급한 바 있다. 필자는 최근 국내 논리학계에서 일고 있는 잭슨의 논란 없는 원리에 대한 논쟁이 거의 히스테리 담론의 구조에 가까이 있다는 것을 논증하고자 한다. 필자의 논제는 단순하다. 직설법적 조건문의 의미를 진리함수적 진리조건으로 해명하려고 한다면, 잭슨의 논란 없는 원리는 논란 없이 성립한다. 따라서 송하석, 최원배 그리고 양은석 등이 이병덕에게 가하는 비판은 타당하다. 그러나 직설법적 조건문의 진리조건이 질료적 조건문의 진리조건보다 약한 진리 조건을 가진다는 것을 지지하거나 에징튼이 하는 것처럼 직설법적 조건문의 의미는 어떠한 종류의 진리함수적 진리 조건과도 무관하다는 것을 지지한다면 이병덕의 주장도 수용될 수 있다는 것이다. 결국 논란 없는 원리의 성립 여부는 조건문의 의미론의 문제로 환원된다. 그런데 의미는 여러 층위에서 논의될 수 있다. 예를 들어, 데이 딕토(de dicto) 차원의 의미와 데이 레이(de re) 차원의 의미를 구분할 수 있다. 그런데 후자의 경우, 화자에 따라, 예를 들어, ‘사랑’이라는 동일한 용어가 ‘눈물의 씨앗’을 의미할 수도 있고 ‘영원한 생명’을 의미할 수도 있다. 이러한 모든 주장은 필자의 논제를 정당화하는 것에로 귀결될 것이다. 각자의 논리적 정당화는 각자가 가지고 있는 심리적 확신에 근거한다. 이것은 우리가 확정하고자 하는 대상이 실재, 상상 그리고 상징 사이에서 맴도는 그 어떤 것으로서 확정적인 고정이나 공간화를 불허하기 때문이다.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-0750		KJD:ART001900015		
J	구자혁								Gendered Structure of Korean Political Modernity and the Rise of Domesticity in Korean Politics: An Essay on the Genesic Structure and the Nature of New ‘Citizen Politics’			한국 정치적 현대성의 젠더화된 구조와 가내성(家內性)의 정치적 부상: 새로운 ʻ시민정치ʼ의 발생적 구조와 본성에 관한 시론(試論)					Korean Journal of Sociology	한국사회학			48	4			127	178					2014	2014	In this study, I attempt a conceptual historical reconstruction of one facet of Korean modernity in order to achieve a better understanding of features of political participation, collective action, and nature of ‘persons’ or ‘individuals’ rising therefrom, which have been conspicuous in South Korean political development toward so-called ‘the third political,’ or ‘citizen politics’ since the early 2000s. What is argued here to be unique in Korean political modernity is that the more or less universal process of genderization and social division of labor between two sexes, with its combination with socio-cultural situations specific to Korean society, led to the structuration of the division of the public and the private, of the political and nonpolitical, and even the relationship between the state and civil society into gendered imaginaries and cultural models. As a consequence, civil society assumes ‘femininty’ as a locus of the private, the personal, desire, interests, i.e. that of ‘domesticity,’ and categorically stands against the ‘masculinized’ state as a locus of the public, the political, and of the worlds of ideologies and values. ‘Transcendental publicness,’ as an ideal for politics, and ‘masculinity of aloofness,’ as a model of political subjectivity, became dominant in official political society of Korea by virtue of gendered social formations mentioned above, and resulted in dualistic structuration of political society between ‘politics of value’ and ‘politics of want,’ and in the elitist oligarchization and autonomization of political society. The decisive rupture of this social formation came from mass upheaval based on politicization and self-acceptance of domesticity and private life, which had been regarded as femininity, rather than from protest publics of social movements oriented toward the de-domestication of civil society and toward an order based on male-centered fraternity. This new aspect of political subjectivity, which can be symbolically epitomized into the images of ‘wild goose dad’ and ‘squad of baby stroller,’ can be conceptualized as ‘politicized domesticity’ in that not only its motivational sources were domestic private spaces, but also it was domestic in nature in its goals, exhibited participatory features, and even socio-demographic properties of participants. This transformation or sublimation of domesticity, from being greedy, anti-social, resulting in its excommunication from the political, public spaces, to the public and political being, has disrupted every problematic element of the conventional ‘republican’ model of civic engagement in Korea. This advent of privatized political subjectivity calls attention to theoretical needs 1) to modify the conventional theoretical framework in which civil society is reduced into protest publics, and 2) to accommodate, both analytically and normatively, diverse spaces for ‘the social,’ newly rising from the private and the personal as well as the contemporary forms of public sphere accompanied by those spaces.				이 글은 ʻʻ제3정치성ʼʼ, ʻʻ시민정치ʼʼ 등으로 개념화되어온 2000년대 초 이후의 한국사회의 새로운 정치참여, 집합행위의 양상, 그리고 이를 통해 정치적으로 부상한 ʻ개인ʼ의 성격을 이해하기 위해 한국적 현대성의 구조화의 일면을 젠더화의 과정으로서 개념사적으로 재구성한다. 한국의 정치적 현대성에 고유한 것은 서구적 공론장 모델에 내재한 남성지배, 성별분업의 다소 보편적인 상황이 한국사회에 고유한 사회문화적 상황과 결합하여 공적인 것과 사적인 것, 정치적인 것과 비정치적인 것의 구분, 그리고 국가와 시민사회의 관계조차도 젠더화된 상상과 문화모델로 구조화되었다는 점이다. 그 결과 시민사회는 사적이고 개인적인 것, 욕망, 이익의 장소, 즉 ʻ가내성ʼ의 장소로 정위되어 ʻ여성성ʼ이 할당되고, 공적이고 정치적인 것, 이념과 가치의 세계로서의 ʻ남성화된ʼ 국가와 대립된다. 이러한 사회적 편제에 의해 지배적이 되는 초월적 공공성의 정치의 이상과 ʻ초연적 남성성ʼ의 정치주체성의 모델은 한국의 정치사회를 ʻ가치의 정치ʼ와 ʻ욕망의 정치ʼ로 이중적으로 구조화하였고, 공식 정치사회의 엘리트적 과두화와 자율화를 낳았다. 이러한 체제의 균열은, 시민사회의 탈가내화와 남성 중심의 형제애에 기반한 질서를 지향했던 사회운동 중심의 저항적 공중이 아닌, 여성성으로 간주되었던 사생활과 가내성을 수용하고 그 가내성 자체를 정치화하려는 대중적 움직임에 의해 결정적으로 이루어졌다. ʻ기러기 아빠ʼ와 ʻ유모차 부대ʼ로 상징적으로 집약될 수 있는 이 새로운 정치주체성은 가내화된 사적 공간이 그 동기적 원천일 뿐 아니라, 내거는 목표와 참여의 양상, 그 주체에 있어서도 가내화된, ʻ정치화된 가내성ʼ으로 개념화될 수 있다. 탐욕스럽고 반사회적인 것으로 간주되어 정치적, 공적 공간에서 추방되었던 가내성은 자신을 공적인 것, 정치적인 것으로 승화, 전화시키면서 전통적인 공화주의적 정치참여의 모델을 균열시켰다. 이러한 사사화된 정치주체성의 등장은 저항적 공중으로 시민사회를 환원해온 사회과학의 기존 문제틀을 수정하고, 사적이고 개인적인 것에 의해 구축되는 ʻ사회적인 것ʼ의 다양한 공간과 그에 수반되는 공론장의 현대적 형태를 분석적으로뿐 아니라 규범적으로도 적절히 수용할 필요성을 제기한다.					0	0	0	0	0	1225-0120		KJD:ART001906759		
J	Kim, Jin Sook								Performing Gender and the Death Drive								Religion and Culture	종교와 문화			27				119	145					2014	2014	This paper demonstrates spiritual and eschatological characteristics of Gregory of Nyssa’s theory of gender transformation as well as of Judith Butler’s gender performativity, by comparing and analyzing both theories in the lens of Lacanian topology. This method of Lacanian topology will illustrate not only the similarity and the difference between religious practice and political (secular) practice, but also how religious practice differentiates from the secular practice in terms of the concept and significance. Consequently, this project will contribute to illuminating the similarity and the difference between ‘religion’ and ‘being religious’. To this end, this project first shows the distinctiveness of the foundational premise of Gregory’s and Butler’s the theory of subjectivity, gender, self-identity, and the matter of body and soul. Next, the graph of desire representing Lacanian topology displays innovative interpretation of the two theorists’ gender practices in the process of imaginary and symbolic identification. But ultimately, this project demonstrates that the death drive leads the two gender theories to practice as well as to spiritual revolution, by analyzing the problem of death and spirituality in terms of the Lacanian symbolic death.									0	0	0	0	0	1976-7900		KJD:ART001954295		
J	한재희								Pratyutpannasamadhi and the Origin of Mahayana			반주삼매(般舟三昧)와 대승불교의 기원					The Journal of Indian Philosophy	인도철학			42				435	471					2014	2014	Clarification about the origin of Mahayana is one of the most controversial issues in current Buddhist academia. A number of Buddhist scholars have studied this issue, however, they still can not perfectly explain it even today. Contemporary Buddhist scholars would admit that the early Mahayana is not any of the following: an independent sect, an ordination lineage (nikaya), a monolith, a concession to laity needs, nor does it have an inherent connection between Mahayana and the stupa cults. In this paper, I attempted to demonstrate the relationship between Pratyutpannasamadhi(般舟三昧) and the origin of Mahayana based on the Pratyutpannasamadhi sutra, which was translated into classical Chinese by Lokakṣema as early as 179 A.D. Pratyutpannasamadhi is a type of buddhanusmṛti, which is a practice of meditation emphasizing visionary experience and has appeared throughout some of the Sravakayana literature, such as the Sutta Nipata, the Aṇguttara Nikaya, and the Zengyi Ahanjing (增壹阿含經). In this original visualization meditation practice Pratyutpannasamadhi incorporates several characteristics of the early Mahayana including an emphasis on the tradition of asceticism, which was required by the monks in the Sravakayana tradition. The Sravakayana tradition incorporates both the ambiguous expressions of Amitabha, who is a typical Buddha of Mahayana, and the concept of Mahayanized Emptiness. These characteristics show that early Mahayana was at its root an extension of the Sravakayana tradition. According to the teachings of the Pratyutpannasamadhi Sutra, one who practices pratyutpannasamadhi can have a direct encounter with an imaginary Buddha in a meditative state and he/she can substantialize the experience. This process of meditation opens the way to re-turn the Dharma wheel, which was put to a halt after Sakyamuni Buddha’s parinirvaṇa. This new Dharma had exerted an influence on the formation of Mahayana by “textual movement” centered on the composition, use, and circulation of the new dharma sutras, and that of the Dharmabhaṇaka, or “Dharma preachers,” which were its principle agents. This article hypotheses how the Mahayana Sutras were compiled and how established the Mahayana are in today’s society.				반주삼매는 초기 대승불교의 특징적인 요소들이 잘 나타나 있는 불수념의 한 종류다. 반주삼매의 원류은 숫따니빠따 , 앙굿따라 니까야 , 증일아함경 과 같은 초기경전들에서 발견되는데, 이것이 반주삼매경 에 이르러 더욱 발전된 모습을 보여주고 있다. 반주삼매경 에서 설명하는 반주삼매에서는, 출가주의에 대한 강조와 관상의 대상으로 명시되는 아미타불에 관한 모호한 표현, 그리고 대승화된 공사상이 나타난다. 이와 같은 근거들을 통해 반주삼매경 의 찬술이 기존 불교전통의 연장선상에서 이루어졌을 것으로 추정할 수 있다. 특히, 반주삼매의 과정에서 수행자는 현전한 가상의 붓다를 친견하고, 그것에 대한 실체화를 하는데, 이 과정이 새로운 경전의 생산을 가능케 하는 전제가 되었다고 보았다. 이와 같이 등장한 새로운 경전이 법사를 중심으로 진행된 ‘경전 확산 운동(textual movement)’으로 발전하여 훗날 대승불교의 기원으로 이어졌다고 추론해 보았다.					0	0	0	0	0	1226-3230		KJD:ART001946326		
J	Leehwado								The possibility of crosslinking between the thought about subject of Lacan and early childhood education			Lacan의 주체형성에 대한 사유와 유아교육의 접점가능성					The Journal of Korea Open Association for Early Childhood Education	열린유아교육연구			19	6			1	20					2014	2014	Explore new alternatives for early childhood education, this study finds the humanistic basis that provides a space for the logical exploration of contemporary early childhood education. The study, drawing on Lacan’s theory and its psychoanalytic response to ontological questions about the nature of human beings, discusses these ideas in relation to education issues. This study concerns the exploration of the possibility of crosslinking between humanistic thought and early childhood education of ontology and epistemology. Lacan proposed a new subject theory that is based on the unconscious, and that embraces all of the humanities including philosophy and linguistics and is based on the theoretical foundations of psychoanalysis-foundations that have been neglected since Freud. Lacan's stage theory, in particular, is providing a useful theoretical base for the formation of childhood self-identity by explaining the process by which humans change as social beings through psychoanalytic principles. The ideas of Lacan about the formation of subject and ego suggest the possibility of an education where consciousness and unconsciousness coexist; education starts from understanding children as the subject of alienation and fragmentation; early childhood education, which is based on understanding children as the subject of creation, goes together with the understanding children as the unconscious subject and the active-subject.				본 연구는 현대 유아교육이 취할 수 있는 탐구논리의 공간을 제공할 인문학적 기초를 인간존재의 본질에 관한 존재론적 질문에 정신분석적 주체 이론으로 응답한 라깡의 이론에서 찾아, 이를 교육 문제와 함께 논의함으로써 유아교육의 새로운 대안을 탐색하고자 하였다. 곧 존재론과 인간학의 인문학적 사유와 유아교육의 접점가능성에 대한 탐색이다. 라깡은 프로이드 이후 등한시해 온 정신분석의 이론적 기초를 근거로, 철학과 언어학을 비롯한 인문학 전반을 끌어들여, 무의식에 근거한 새로운 주체 이론을 구성한다. 특히 그의 단계이론은 인간이 사회적 존재로 변화해 가는 과정을 정신분석 원리를 통해 설명함으로써, 유아기 자아정체감 형성에 대한 유용한 이론적 기반을 제공한다. 주체와 자아형성에 대한 라깡의 사유는 무의식의 주체, 역동적 주체로서의 유아에 대한 이해와 함께, 의식과 무의식이 공존하는 교육, 소외와 분열의 주체로서의 유아이해에서 출발하는 교육, 생성의 주체로서의 유아이해에 근거한 유아교육의 가능성을 제안한다.					0	0	0	0	0	1226-8119		KJD:ART001949038		
J	강영자; Lee, Shin-dong								An Implication of Dabrowski's Positive Disintegration and Overexcitability Theory on Counseling for The Gifted			Dabrowski의 긍정적 분화와 과흥분성 이론이 영재상담에 주는 함의					The Korea Educational Review	한국교육학연구			20	2			379	400					2014	2014	The purpose of this study is to establish the foundation for differentiated gifted child counseling by understanding the personality development process and emotional characteristics of gifted children. This study also aims to consider an implication of Dabrowski's theories on developmental counseling and therapeutic counseling and to signpost for gifted child counseling by analyzing the concept of gifted child counseling, counseling needs of gifted children and preceding studies. For achieving these purposes, this study looked into the personality development process and socio-emotional characteristics of gifted children, based on Dabrowski's positive disintegration theory and overexcitability theory, and checked the possibility of applying the theories on counseling for gifted children. Dabrowski argued that the extreme pain and stress of gifted children in the process of their growth and developmental change are kinds of 'positive disintegration', and defined the personality development process to reach integrated personality as a positive disintegration theory. He also considered overexcitability as a potential factor to be a foundation for superior personality development, and said a gifted child has five domains of overexcitability; psychomotor overexcitability, sensual overexcitability, imaginary overexcitability, imaginational-inquiry overexcitability and emotional overexcitability. Therefore, Dabrowski's theories are very helpful in understanding various special problems of the gifted and counseling them. The implication of positive disintegration theory and overexcitability theory of Dabrowski on counseling for gifted children is as follows. Dabrowski's two theories help in understanding that dysfunctional behaviors of gifted children means their growth process through developmental counseling with preventive purposes. They also settle problems of gifted children through therapeutic counseling and help a lot of gifted children in trouble. In conclusion, counseling model and counseling program should be developed for differentiated gifted child counseling, and on the basis of the importance of gifted child counseling, it is required to foster teachers for gifted child counseling and to try to think emotional problems of gifted children positively.				본 연구의 목적은 영재의 성격 발달 과정과 정서적 특징을 이해하여 차별화된 영재 상담을 하기 위한 발판을 마련하는 것이다. 또한 영재 상담의 개념과 영재의 상담적 요구, 선행연구 분석을 통하여 Dabrowski의 이론이 영재 상담에 주는 함의를 발달적 상담과 치료적 상담으로 나누어 고찰해 보고 영재 상담이 나아갈 방향을 제시하는 것이다. 본 연구는 Dabrowski의 긍정적 분화와 과흥분성 이론을 통해 영재의 성격 발달 과정과 사회 정서적 특성을 알아보고 영재 상담에 적용 가능성을 살펴보았다. Dabrowski는 영재들이 경험하게 되는 그들의 성장과 발달적 변환의 과정에 필수적으로 동반되는 격심한 고통과 스트레스를 ‘긍정적 분화’라고 하고 통합된 성격에 이르는 성격발달과정을 이론화 하여 긍정적 분화 이론이라고 하였다. 또한 그는 과흥분성을 상위의 성격발달의 기초가 되는 잠재성으로 보고 영재는 다섯 가지 영역의 심체적, 감각적, 상상적, 지적 탐구, 감성적 과흥분성을 가진다고 하였다. 따라서 영재의 다양하고 특수한 문제들을 이해하고 상담을 하는데 Dabrowski의 이론은 매우 유용하다. 본 연구에서 밝혀낸 Dabrowski의 긍정적 분화와 과흥분성 이론이 영재 상담에 주는 함의는 다음과 같다. Dabrowski의 이론은 예방적 차원의 발달적 상담을 통해 영재의 역기능적인 행동들이 영재가 성장하는 과정임을 알게 해줄 수 있다. 또한 치료적 상담을 통해 영재가 처한 문제를 해결할 수 있도록 하고 위기에 처한 영재들에게 많은 도움을 줄 수 있다. 이에 영재 상담이 나아갈 방향은 영재의 차별화된 상담을 위하여 상담 모형 및 상담 프로그램이 개발되어야하며 영재 상담의 중요성을 인식하여 영재상담 교사의 육성과 영재의 정서적 문제에 대한 긍정적인 시각의 전환이 필요하다.					0	0	0	0	0	1598-9054		KJD:ART001892446		
J	김경희								A Study of The Story Design of Children's Park			어린이 공원의 스토리 디자인에 관한 연구					The Korea Society of Craft	한국공예논총			17	4			189	203					2014	2014	The animals such as elephant, giraffe, bear, lizard, salamander, some plants, and imaginary animals like dragon, ship, creative books and stories were used as materials for story design of Children’s Park. In addition, butterfly, ant and insect were used to make the formation more fun. The reason why Children’s Park needs play equipment is because children can have spatial experiences and they can be the main actors by using the play equipment built with story design. They can obtain the sense of belonging, social awareness and the culture to share. To strengthen the development of children and the instructional function of the play equipment, the design factors must be arranged appropriately. However, the story designs of the children’s parks that are already built are various but sometime they are not matched with the subject of park. Also, there are many play equipments that are the same in spite of the fact that the subjects of play equipments are all different. So this kind of issue needs to be considered when doing designing and producing. The story design of Children’s Park is a symbolic design by harboring the history of regional culture and history so Children’s Park can be a creative space that has a creative culture. It seems to be a good idea if Children’s Park can be creatively, emotionally and lively organized by applying story design to play equipments.				어린이 공원의 스토리디자인의 소재는 코끼리, 기린, 곰, 도마뱀, 도롱뇽 등의 동물과 식물, 가상동물인 용과 배, 창의적 책, 동화 등을 소재로 하였으며 나비, 개미, 곤충 등을 소재로 하여 보다 재미있는 구성으로 되었다. 어린이 공원에서 놀이기구가 필요한 것은 어린이들이 공간적 경험을 할 수 있다는 것이다. 놀이공간에서 스토리디자인으로 된 놀이기구를 사용한다는 것은 스토리의 주인공이 될 수 있으며 어린이들이 사용함으로써 사회에 적응하고 같은 연령대의 어린이들끼리의 유대감, 사회적 인지기능, 문화를 이룰 수 있다. 어린이들의 발달과 놀이기구의 학습적 기능을 돋보이려면 놀이기구에 디자인의 모든 요소를 적절히 배치되어야 할 것이다. 다만 이미 세워진 어린이 공원의 스토리디자인이 다양지만 공원의 제목과 공원의 주제는 일치하지 않은 곳도 있으며 놀이기구도 주제가 다르게 나왔으나 놀이기구는 일률적인 것이 많다. 이러한 점을 스토리디자인에 보다 충실하게 디자인하여 제작하고 개선해야 할 것이다. 어린이 공원의 스토리디자인은 각 지역의 문화, 역사의 스토리를 통한 상징적인 디자인으로 창의적인 문화가 되는 창조적인 공간이 될 수 있다. 이러한 어린이 공원의 스토리디자인을 놀이기구에 도입, 공원의 창조적 감성으로 또는 생동적으로 조성할 수 있다면 좋을 것이라고 여겨진다.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-1412		KJD:ART001950243

Considering all the transcriptional different versions presently delivered are Korean version, it is estimated the major readers were women, and in regard that the different version used colloquial style or obscene language, it can be said that not only the noble women but also the common women transcribed and enjoyed this work. According to publication method, novel version SukyeongNangjaJeon can be regarded as transcription version, plate version, and printed book, also, according to different version, various differences, e.g. whether or not of marriage between Lim sojeo and Seongun, reborn Nangja's attitude problem, etc. according to different version, appear. This difference implies the significance of the latter part of the work was importantly recognized by the novel readers of that time as the difference of the latter part of the work. Different version of SukyeongNangjaJeon is largely divided into ‘water burial-reincarnation' line and ‘funeral parlor-reincarnation' line according to whether or not of funeral, again, ‘water burial-reincarnation' line is divided into the heavenly world, earthly life, and taoist world according to Nangja's positioned space. Recognition on tragic reality appears in ‘water burial- reincarnation-heavenly world' line, the readers of which line show the ten- dency to accomplish the affection between husband and wife in the heavenly world by escaping from the earthly world. It seemed that the readers of ‘water burial-reincarnation-earthly world' concern about how to live their life ‘here and now', aiming at family harmony, and the readers of ‘water burial-reincarnation-taoist world' wanted to prepare an imaginary exit of women's liberation through the alternative spaces called Okyeondong and Jookrimdong, SukyeongNangjaJeon is dealing with the present topic of the women who live ‘daughter-in-law' lives in Confucius ideology, and it seems that the readers of this novel tried to find out their own answer to the question of life in Nangja's life, i.e. ‘how and where to live?' that they con- cerned about.				｢숙영낭자전｣의 異本은 장례의 유무에 따라 크게 ‘水葬-再生’계열과 ‘殯所－再生’계열로 나뉘고, ‘수장－재생’계열은 다시 낭자의 거취 공간에 따라 天上界와 地上界, 仙界로 나누어 볼 수 있다. ‘水葬－再生－天上界’계열에는 비극적 현실 인식이 나타나며, 이 계열의 향유자들은 地上界를 탈피하여 부부의 애정을 天上界에서 성취하고자 하는 경향을 보인다. ‘水葬－再生－地上界’계열의 향유자들은 ‘지금 여기’에서 삶을 어떻게 꾸려나갈 것인가를 고민하며 가족의 화합을 지향했고, ‘水葬－再生－仙界’계열의 향유자들은 옥연동과 죽림동이라는 대안 공간을 통해 女性 解放의 想像的 출구를 마련하고자 했던 것으로 보인다. ｢숙영낭자전｣은 유교적 이념 속에서 살아가야 하는 “시집”살이 하는 여성들의 당면 문제를 다루고 있는 작품으로, 이 소설의 독자들은 낭자의 삶 속에서 이들이 안고 있던 삶의 문제 즉, ‘어디서 어떻게 살 것인가?’라는 물음에 대한 그들 나름의 해답을 찾고자 했던 것으로 보인다.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-1617		KJD:ART001890263		
J	김성철								Comparison of the Roles Carried Out by New Female Characters from <端宗大王實記: the Actual Records of King Danjong> and <端宗哀史: Sad History of Danjong>			『단종대왕실기』와 <단종애사>의 허구적 여성인물에게투영된 작자 의식					The Studies of Korean Literature	우리문학연구			43				73	97					2014	2014	<端宗大王實記: the Actual Records of King Danjong> and <端宗哀史: Sad History of Danjong> were published in the same period. Both were mainly composed of an incident which occurred in the reign of King Danjong and King Sejo. Standing on the basis of the records from <燃藜室記述: Yeonryosilgisul>, narrative progressions and characters of both are almost the same. Both have female characters who don’t appear in other historical books or unofficial histories. They are Okhwa from <the Actual Records of King Danjong> and Yahwa from <Sad History of Danjong>. They, who were women from Jurchen(女眞) tribe, were portrayed as third concubines of Kim Jongseo. From the moment she first appears in <the Actual Records of King Danjong> to the moment she is killed by a follower of Infante Suyang, Okhwa maintains her consistent personality. She is a character who has a tendency of an amazon. While maintaining this personality without woolgathering, she stands by Kim Jongseo. But to the contrary, Yahwa from <Sad History of Danjong> was portrayed as a stranger from different ethnic group, and a character who gives off her sexual charm. And Kim Jongseo was portrayed as a greedy old man who had a lust for body. Both <the Actual Records of King Danjong> and <Sad History of Danjong> maintain narratives which center King Danjong and King Sejo. Okhwa and Yahwa are newly created characters. Through the two imaginary characters, the authors reflect their views. Because <the Actual Records of King Danjong> has an attitude of narrating that defends King Danjong, Okhwa exists in the same field. However, by presenting Yahwa as an object of sexual desire, apart from its view on King Danjong, <Sad History of Danjong> criticizes Kim Jongseo in a roundabout way. Setting this difference on center, this study was conducted to cast light upon the views that the two authors see their works through new characters.				『단종대왕실기』와 <단종애사>는 동일한 시기에 발간되고 연재되었다. 두 작품은 단종과 세조조에 발생한 사건을 중심으로 구성되었다. 『연려실기술』의 기록을 기반으로 했기 때문에 두 작품의 서사 진행과 등장인물은 거의 동일하다. 여타의 역사서와 야사류에 등장하지 않고 두 작품에서 처음으로 등장하는 여성 인물이 있다. 『단종대왕실기』의 ‘옥화’와 <단종애사>의 ‘야화’가 그들이다. 여진족 여인인 ‘옥화’와 ‘야화’는 김종서의 세 번째 첩으로 설정되어 있다. 『단종대왕실기』에서 ‘옥화’는 등장하는 순간부터 수양대군의 수하에게 죽임을 당하는 순간까지 일관된 성격을 유지한다. ‘옥화’는 여진족이면서 전투를 가까이에서 접한 인물이기 때문에 무사의 기질을 지니고 있는 인물이다. 이러한 성격을 흐트러짐없이 유지하면서 김종서의 곁을 지킨다. 반면 <단종애사>의 ‘야화’는 이민족 출신의 낯선 여성으로서 묘사되어 있으며, 성적인 매력을 발산하는 인물로 설정되어 있다. 김종서는 ‘야화’의 몸을 탐하는 늙은이로 묘사되어 있다. 『단종대왕실기』와 <단종애사>는 단종과 세조가 중심이 되는 서사를 유지하면서 전개하는 공통점을 지니고 있다. ‘옥화’와 ‘야화’는 새롭게 창조된 인물이다. ‘가상의 인물’인 ‘옥화’와 ‘야화’를 통해 작자는 자신의 시각을 반영한다. 『단종대왕실기』는 철저하게 단종의 편에서 단종을 변호하는 서술 태도를 지니고 있기 때문에 ‘옥화’도 그와 같은 자장 안에 존재한다. 하지만 <단종애사>는 단종에 대한 시각과는 별개로 성적인 대상으로 ‘야화’를 등장시킴으로써 김종서에 대한 비판을 대신한다. 본고는 이러한 차이를 중심으로 두 작품의 작가가 새로운 인물을 통해 작품을 바라보는 시선을 조명하는 것을 목적으로 서술되었다.					0	0	0	0	0	1229-7429		KJD:ART001898666		
J	Taylor-Alexander, Samuel								Bioethics in the Making: "Ideal Patients" and the Beginnings of Face Transplant Surgery in Mexico								SCIENCE AS CULTURE				23	1			27	50		10.1080/09505431.2013.789843			JAN 2 2014	2014	Medical teams around the world are increasingly gaining ethical clearance to utilise face transplant surgery as a reconstructive surgical procedure. Analysis of the beginnings of the operation in Mexico vis-a-vis the early uptake of the procedure in France reveals that this controversial experimental medical field has become loaded with national significance. The primary issue of dispute has been the dependence on life-threatening immunosuppressant therapy in a procedure that treats otherwise biologically healthy people. Attempts to resolve related debate has resulted in the emergence of what my interlocutors refer to as an ideal patient, a person whose particular state of health and suffering render them operable within the current biomedical constraints. Drawing together the idiom of coproduction with the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries shows how this imagined patient category was refracted and stabilised as it entered into the Mexican context whilst producing patients and surgical experts as particular types of bioethical subjects. The flexibility and normative value of the ideal patient mobilises and is mobilised by surgeons, who themselves emerge as national bioethical subjects responsible for saving the face of nations in the midst of broader changes surrounding how State's should respond to medical advancement.									0	0	0	0	0	0950-5431		WOS:000329776700002		
J	Brennan, Bernadette								Kim Cheng Boey's Between Stations: 'The Architecture of Memory'								LIFE WRITING				11	1			39	54		10.1080/14484528.2013.838731			JAN 2 2014	2014	Kim Cheng Boey's Between Stations (2009) presents as a series of essays tracing Boey's travels from Singapore, the place of his birth, through India, China, Egypt and Morocco, to his new home' in Australia. The essays build in intensity so that, read collectively, they become a layered memoir of loss and mourning. Boey's travels are less to do with discovered new geographical sites than they are to do with the craft of writing and the exploration of the places and spaces of childhood memory. Boey's restless need to travel is inextricably connected to his vocation as writer. He uses the act of travel to provide a metatextual commentary on the acts of writing and reading. Like travel, writing and reading involve border crossings, the discovery of new horizons and acts of translation, particularly translation of the self. Boey is attracted to Salman Rushdie's belief that readers and writers who are borne across the world' are translated men' (Imaginary Homelands), and to Seamus Heaney's claim that writing necessarily involves a state of displacement or exile. This article investigates how a displaced, wandering, immigrant Boey travels forward through space and backwards through time to explore the architecture of his childhood memories and produce a hauntingly powerful life narrative of loss and desire.									0	0	0	0	0	1448-4528		WOS:000329824200004

This paper focuses on two experiments of this kind - the Millennium Villages Project in sub-Saharan Africa and the Rural Cities Project in southern Mexico - both of which aim to achieve the Millennium Development Goals through an integrated set of interventions at the village level. Drawing on Henri Lefebvre's work on the colonization of everyday life, I argue that the Millennium Development Goals function in these cases to facilitate and legitimate the production of social reality based on a naturalised vision of market society. These utopian projects embody the paradoxical character of neoliberalization, demonstrating the necessarily social production of the supposedly natural order on which neoliberalism is discursively premised, while reproducing the strategies of social engineering that the neoliberal project is rhetorically oriented against.									2	0	0	0	2	0306-6150		WOS:000331335600005		
J	Schriewer, Juergen				boran, gul hanim/C-5889-2014				Neither orthodoxy nor randomness: differing logics of conducting comparative and international studies in education								COMPARATIVE EDUCATION				50	1	SI		84	101		10.1080/03050068.2014.883745			JAN 2 2014	2014	The issue of the presumed 'identity' of Comparative Education as a field of study or a discipline has been discussed for decades. Yet what remains open to question is a kind of systematic structure that provides the basic principles for a coherent exposition of the field. After conceptualising and rejecting almost a dozen possible outlines for such an exposition over recent years, my contention is that 'Comparative Education' can no longer be conceived in terms of an imaginary field's coherence - let alone consistency - but, rather, in terms of distinct branches of comparative and international studies in education and their underlying problematiques. Such an understanding is fostered through a deepened awareness of the basic problems, and successive solutions, constitutive of the emergence and further conformations of the comparative approach in education and the social sciences. This requires analyses informed by the sociology and the history of the sciences. Thus, drawing some inspiration from the thought-provoking theses formulated by historical sociologist Friedrich H. Tenbruck, and building on some of my earlier works concerning the history and theory of comparative study, I shall try, in this essay, to untangle the structural distinctions accounting for what I propose to call the 'epistemo-logic' of comparative social enquiry proper, the 'socio-logic' of reform-orientated international studies on education, and the 'globo-logic' of investigating inherently trans-national and/or world-spanning educational phenomena and organisations.									3	0	0	0	3	0305-0068		WOS:000331520600008

Building on a tradition of maintenance art', the work exhibits the power of soil, plants and microorganisms to clean water - in effect maintaining urban water. An overarching goal of WATERWASH is to educate local people about the metabolism of urban water, causes of river pollution, and to familiarize them with the capacity of soil and plants to respond to that problem. As part of its creation, the project provided diverse groups of people with opportunities to participate, including a group of Bronx youth who assisted in planting the wetland. Several of these apprentices will be involved in future monitoring of the effectiveness of the wetland in mitigating parking lot runoff. I use Isabelle Stengers' notion of diplomacy' to interrogate the efforts of the artist in negotiating and creating an occasion in which people with divergent interests can both recognize and maintain the relationships of care that sustain them. In effect, this effort extends the feminist discourse of maintenance work to include that undertaken by the other-than-human'. Lavando agua urbana: diplomacia en arte ambiental en el Bronx, ciudad de Nueva YorkEl proyecto artistico de Lillian Ball, WATERWASH, crea un nuevo imaginario ecologico en el Bronx del Sur.

J	Blecha, Jennifer; Leitner, Helga								Reimagining the food system, the economy, and urban life: new urban chicken-keepers in US cities								URBAN GEOGRAPHY				35	1			86	108		10.1080/02723638.2013.845999			JAN 2 2014	2014	Since the mid-nineteenth century, poultry and livestock animals have increasingly been seen as out of place in, and excluded from, modern United States cities. Yet, since 2000, increasing numbers of urban residents have begun keeping chickens and other small livestock in backyards. Through an analysis of the re-emergence of this practice in Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington, we show that chicken-keepers are not raising chickens simply to save money or to pursue an eccentric hobby, but rather as an explicit effort to promote and enact alternative urban imaginaries. Such imaginaries make possible alternative practices, and in turn, the performance of everyday practices reshapes urban imaginaries. In interviews, participants critique the industrial food system, urban economies and social life, and "think differently" about human-animal relations and productive animals in cities. Through chicken-keeping practices, they establish sustainable backyard agro-ecosystems, build sociability, resist consumerism, and work simultaneously to improve the life and health of animals, humans, and the urban environment.									0	0	0	0	0	0272-3638		WOS:000331032100005

This article considers planning organisations as also producers of fantasies. These are fantasies that organise the collective desires of a polity and construct the visions that guide and shape the agency of the organisation itself. Further, in contrast to differentiating between fantasy and reality, this article will take a psychoanalytical approach to fantasy where fantasy helps to structure a subject's reality and, in aggregate, that of a subject's society. This is a perspective that acknowledges a constitutively unclear division between these two ideas of a materialised reality produced by our actions and the fantasies that help generate this observable materialisation. Exploring this issue is important, as the article will argue that this fantasy construction underlies much that constitutes planning policy practice and regularly occurs even when planning actors know that these desired fantasised outcomes cannot possibly be achieved within a plan or policy. After exploring the Auckland Plan as an exemplar of fantasy construction, the article will argue that planning needs to acquire a different relationship to fantasy, one in which planning is no longer in thrall' to fantasy and the improbable desires that planning fantasies often propagate. ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????									0	0	0	0	0	0811-1146		WOS:000332060500001

Yet the scholarship on the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), remains largely restricted to questions of strategic, political and military effectiveness. The transnational character of the anti-apartheid struggle is mostly absent from nationalist historiographies, while little is known about the daily lives of those who made up the ranks of MK, their interactions with host communities, and the implications of having a large, predominantly male army - with their feelings, longings and frustrations - stationed outside South Africa's borders for three decades. Morogoro, a small upcountry town in Tanzania, was one of the key sites where relations between South African exiles and Tanzanians were forged. In the early years of exile, relationships between ANC/MK cadres and Tanzanian women were not officially sanctioned by the movement, but from the late 1970s they were increasingly formalised through marriage. In this way, the lives of many Tanzanian women became entangled with the South African liberation struggle. Relationships and marriages between South African exiles and Tanzanian women were not only a significant aspect of everyday life in exile, but also key components of an ANC familyhood, linked in turn to expressions of masculinity in MK and to the making of a national community and imaginary. This article seeks to illustrate the complex implications and present repercussions of these marriages and relationships by tracing the lives of seven Tanzanian women, which reveal a multiplicity of personal and emotional entanglements that are obscured by a narrow focus on military and strategic objectives.									1	0	0	0	1	0305-7070		WOS:000332277100009

Brand Aid forms of cause-related marketing								THIRD WORLD QUARTERLY				35	1	SI		65	87		10.1080/01436597.2014.868985			JAN 2 2014	2014	Consumers, partnering with corporations and celebrities, are forming new alliances in international development through what we call 'Brand Aid' initiatives. At a time of shifting relationships between public and private aid, commodities are sold as the means of achieving development for recipients and good feelings for consumers simultaneously. In this article we first formalise our conceptual model of Brand Aid at the triple interface of causes, branded products and celebrities. Then we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of contemporary Brand Aid initiatives, including three in-depth case studies of 'Win One Give One', toms shoes and Product (red). We argue that these not only use imaginaries of development to sell products to Northern consumers but also engage in the work of a 'story factory' - producing truths about international development and consumer engagement that make development appear simplified, manageable and marketable. We conclude that, in Brand Aid, the problems themselves and the people who experience them are branded and marketed to Western consumers (through celebritised multimedia story-telling) just as effectively as the products that will 'save' them.									0	0	0	0	0	0143-6597		WOS:000331332200004

I argue that the artist mobilizes haunting by turning to autobiography, memory and the site of the body. Drawing on Anzaldua's 'mestiza' vision, on Mestiza performance scenes, on correspondence with Tolentino about the work, and on Munoz's work, I argue that the performance stages a lesbian of colour, mestiza subjectivity and imaginary located at the crossroads between worlds, and this act questions the racialised boundaries of social belonging. I discuss the melancholic atmospheres of the performance as structures of feeling and signs of this subjectivity.									0	0	0	0	0	1048-6801		WOS:000332198600004

Bruno served as a queer beast in the anthropogenic landscape where he challenged boundaries of what is permissible, and normal. By refusing to honor borders and cultural norms, he disrupted our human sense of control of the landscape. In response to Bruno's unruly presence, humans in turn appropriated him, fixed him as a cipher to fill with their own constructs of wildness and animality, and then deployed those cultural articulations. Performing a critical visual analysis, this paper explores how the anxiety Bruno evoked fixed his queer, hirsute frame as a taxidermied cipher representing discipline, fetishization, and a critique of power. Bruno became an imaginary wild whose presence rhetorically queered the geographical and political landscape.									0	0	0	0	0	1752-4032		WOS:000333655100006

We explore this under-researched area by means of qualitative research. The experience of CICs and other childhood experiences, onset of PAHs and recovery was explored using in-depth semi-structured interviews with six adults. The key themes revealed by Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis were that all participants had CICs which served a protective function and that their CIC evoked negative reactions from parents. CICs and PAHs were distinct experiences and half of the participants still experienced their CIC. The findings support a model whereby the development of pathological and non-pathological hallucinations in adulthood is mediated by life events. Clinical implications are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	1752-2439		WOS:000333533300005

In-vehicle spaces and boarding points command most attention in regulatory practice and in surveys. Observational fieldwork in Cape Town, and its subsequent review, suggests alternative sites and scales of interest and concern relating to mobility and alcohol (ab)use. Platform, barrier and vehicle are not the only affected spaces: neighbourhoods of embarkation and disembarkation can also be contested and conflictual. These additional sites are material as well as imaginary, symbolic and internalised. 'Liquid spaces' are also a dimension of lived and felt mobility disadvantage and stress among the urban poor.									0	0	0	0	0	0373-6245		WOS:000334388200004

J	Gadoin, Isabelle								The poet in the museum: lost in a chamber of echoes (sight and sign in Thomas Hardy's poetry)								WORD & IMAGE				30	1	SI		13	22		10.1080/02666286.2013.771925			JAN 2 2014	2014	Thomas Hardy's extreme proximity with the visual arts is now well-acknowledged. The writer was first trained as an architect, and used his talents as a draughtsman to copy architectural motifs but also as a spur for imagination and, occasionally, to illustrate his own works with small symbolic or humorous vignettes. An impressive amount of critical literature has been dedicated to the visual quality of descriptive passages in his novels-some of them explicitly influenced by the treatment of colour and light in Turner's late "visionary" work. When it comes to Hardy's poetry, though, the visual impulse seems to be far exceeded by the fascination for sounds and voices. Museums and galleries as they appear in his poems are dark, silent, inauspicious places, where sight seems to be obliterated or even denied. The poet's imaginary then seems to turn away from the canvas and the Great Masters to the fossil, the relic, the stone bearing half-erased inscriptions, as so many tantalising signs awaiting interpretation. The petrified fragments of the past suggest elusive presences that call to the viewer, on an essentially oral mode. It is the viewer's musings which help him decipher, reconstruct, and finally revive the voices of the past, in a complex interplay of reminiscence and imagination. Hardy's poetry thus suggests a conception wholly different from our modern understanding of the museum as a land of Cocaygne, an accumulation of goods with encyclopaedic and totalising ambitions. Hardy's aesthetic is not that of completeness and exhaustiveness but that of the fragment. In the poet's view, the work of art is nothing else than a tentative sign giving the impulse for the free work of memory. It is not a given but a spur to imagination and a "call to ghosts", in the poet's own words. Finally the museum is less a material place than a quintessence of Time, a series of "spots of consciousness" where the past emerges in the present, and lures the poet into an archaeology of human feelings and sensations.									0	0	0	0	0	0266-6286		WOS:000335862800004		
J	Bataillard, Pascal								Musing in and out of the museum with James Joyce's Ulysses								WORD & IMAGE				30	1	SI		39	45		10.1080/02666286.2013.771930			JAN 2 2014	2014	Ulysses became part of the literary canon almost from the moment it was published, and it did not take long before it was turned into a literary monument. As such, it is often celebrated and commented upon; it is perhaps less eagerly visited, except maybe in the form of cursory strolls through selected passages and along a certain number of critical avenues. It will therefore not be surprising to claim that Ulysses is not just about Dublin: the book itself is city, world, and world cultural heritage. Ulysses has long been considered one of the works perfectly embodying the modernist ideal of totality. Even though the claim may sound disputable today, the notion that this novel might constitute a museum of Western civilisation is alluring. James Joyce and Ulysses have spawned several actual museums and 'historical houses' in Dublin, as well as inspired a whole gallery of visual works, thus making up an imaginary multimedia museum. What is more, Bloomsday has reached the status of national holiday, and Bloom's footsteps engraved on the pavement in the distinctive places along his one-day journey are meant to celebrate Joyce's epic. It could be argued that Joyce has been turned into a national monument at the same time as Dublin has been museified, but I will show that Joyce's writing also provides the necessary antidote, that is, the profanation of the sacred. This paper explores the unique way in which Ulysses creates a utopian place in which consciousness can feed on memory and consume the cultural heritage, as well as probe into the past and forget it. In such a space, readers are recreated as flaneurs or nomads wandering aimlessly and egoistically, while provisionally forming an impossible community.									0	0	0	0	0	0266-6286		WOS:000335862800007		
J	Ahlqvist, Toni; Moisio, Sami								Neoliberalisation in a Nordic State: From Cartel Polity towards a Corporate Polity in Finland								NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY				19	1			21	55		10.1080/13563467.2013.768608			JAN 2 2014	2014	In this paper, we present an outline of state transformation in the context of a Nordic welfare state. We use Finland as an example of the transformation process in which a welfare state form we call a cartel polity is shifting towards a corporate polity, a particular adjustment of the competition state. We conceptualise the corporate polity as a spatio-temporal fix under construction. The corporate polity is both an on-going process to build a corporation-inspired management model for the Finnish state and a novel state ethos that is underpinned by constant concern about the state's international competitiveness in front of 'nature-like' market forces, transnational investors and highly skilled labour. We propose that the imaginary of a corporate polity is endorsed by a discursive practice that constructs a ceaseless crisis condition in the Finnish state, through repetitive and mundane activities related to state governance. Through the empirical analysis, we single out four dimensions of the corporate polity: fiscal-managerial, digital, capacity-oriented and territorial. Finally, we provide brief reflections on the potential state transformations in the future.									1	0	0	0	1	1356-3467		WOS:000331600900002

The mutual influence of the cloud behaviour and the user's action offers a great deal of freedom for expressive performances and creative interactions. It also provides a new mode of engagement in virtual images, allowing for the experience of a peculiar kind of dynamic reverie, which is virtually augmented and poetically enriched through the dialog with the cloud-matter.									0	0	0	0	0	0024-094X		WOS:000328877900020

The article presents a case for framing this inquiry in terms of imaginaries. It then argues for a new political imaginary which helps to specify what is required for deliberative democratic practice in a way that shifts us away from the dominant liberal-utilitarian political imaginary that currently informs the political value systems of most Western nations. Drawing on the work of key political theorists such as Habermas and Dahlgren, five propositions or conditions for deliberative practice are identified that can be used in empirical investigation to help determine the democratic capacity and potential of new political communication and civic spaces being opened by means of digital media.									0	0	0	0	0	0263-3957		WOS:000329355600005

In particular, it is suggested that the engagement of political actors with processes of spatial planning tends to be framed within particular spatial imaginaries which reflect established political-administrative and territorial boundaries. It is contended that a critical analysis of the territorial framing of processes of spatial planning is necessary in order to understand the capacity for spatial strategies to effectively challenge and reconfigure established sociospatial imaginaries in functional or relational terms. It is suggested that spatially explicit public policy statements, such as planning strategies, may be characterized by specific assumptions of territorial space, in a similar manner to which mainstream social science has contained implicit assumptions of state-centrism. The salience of territorial spatial imaginaries is demonstrated in the case of European spatial planning and through a local case study of city-regional spatial planning and politics in the Greater Dublin Area.									0	0	0	0	0	0965-4313		WOS:000330109400005

I explore first the origins of Spain's early-twentieth-century modernisation process (1890-1930) and the production of a national modernising imaginary as expressed in debates and actions around the hydrological condition. In the second part, I focus on how Spain's modernisation process after the Civil War became a profoundly scalar geographical project, articulated through the production of a specific technonatural hydraulic edifice during Franco's authoritarian rule (1939-1975). In the third part, I explore how the desalination of seawater has become one of the key contested terrains for managing hydro-scarcities since the transition to democracy.The broader intellectual objective of the paper is, first, to show how diverse political projects, social visions, physical matter, ecological concerns, cultural imaginaries, discursive formations, institutional practices, economic strategies of competitiveness and engineering technologies fuse together and articulate around specific hydro-technical imaginaries and infrastructures. Second, the paper documents how human and non-human actants become enrolled in such processes of hydro-social transformation. Third, the paper considers how the networks of actors sustaining hydro-social transformations mark the transition from a state-centred hydro-structural to a decentralised region-centred market environmentalist water framework.									0	0	0	0	0	0967-3407		WOS:000330415500004

I argue that this shift has impacted one's sense of ontological security usually provided by symbolic networks. The new, narcissistic subject's body inhabiting the imaginary society bears an atomistic vision of security, stemming from the subject's growing aggressivity, all of which leads to focusing on controlling and reshaping the body. Instead of a symbolic identity associated with modernity, this late- or post-modern narcissistic subject identifies with an image of his/her surgically chiseled body through which the subject expects to experience a sense of wholeness, security, enjoyment, and mastery of the self.									0	0	0	0	0	1362-704X		WOS:000331851600002		
J	May, Vivian M.								Speaking into the Void"? Intersectionality Critiques and Epistemic Backlash								HYPATIA-A JOURNAL OF FEMINIST PHILOSOPHY				29	1	SI		94	112		10.1111/hypa.12060			FEB 2014	2014	Taking up Kimberle Crenshaw's conclusion that black feminist theorists seem to continue to find themselves in many ways speaking into the void (Crenshaw 2011, 228), even as their works are widely celebrated, I examine intersectionality critiques as one site where power asymmetries and dominant imaginaries converge in the act of interpretation (or cooptation) of intersectionality. That is, despite its current status, intersectionality also faces epistemic intransigence in the ways in which it is read and applied. My aim is not to suggest that intersectionality cannot (or should not) be critiqued, nor do I maintain that celebratory applications/interpretations are immune from epistemic distortion when it comes to interpreting intersectionality. Rather, my goal is to demonstrate that critiques of intersectionality are one important site to examine hermeneutic marginalization and interpretive violence; the politics of citation; and the impact of dominant expectations or established social imaginaries on meaning-making. In so doing, I aim to consider more fully how entrenched ways of thinking are frequently relied upon to interpret and critique intersectionality, even as these are often the very frameworks that intersectionality theorists have identified as highly problematic tools of misrepresentation, erasure, and violation. This slippage away from intersectionality's outlooks, whether in critical or laudatory contexts, is a pivotal site of epistemic negotiation we must examine more closely.									0	0	0	0	0	0887-5367		WOS:000332331000007		
J	Pathak, Pathik								Ethopolitics and the financial citizen								SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW				62	1			90	116		10.1111/1467-954X.12119			FEB 2014	2014	While personal debt has been the subject of intense research activity over the past decade, in particular from think tanks and government bodies, it remains relatively undertheorized and neglected in general by the social sciences. This article offers a novel theoretical frame for the analysis of personal debt - and personal overindebtedness in particular - by highlighting the construction of deviance from financial behavioural normativities. Using Nikolas Rose's concept of ethopolitics' to describe the relocation of government from questions of rational administration to those of everyday morality and ethics, this article presents two characterizations of deviance from an ethopolitical imaginary of financial citizenship: irresponsibility and incapability. From this framework, the article explores the nature of the state sponsored normalization of indebtedness and the stigmatization of overindebtedness as a corollary of delinquent' dispositions and dependencies. This article suggests that UK government policy concerning financial responsibility has been shaped by an ethopolitical imaginary of financial citizenship which is based upon a skewed understanding of structure and agency which has its parallel in the attribution of unemployment to worklessness'.									0	0	0	0	0	0038-0261		WOS:000332010700005

Hughes' poetry for children is an integral part of his artistic achievements. It exhibits three dimensions: a magnificent imaginary world, a splendid sensory world and an animistic world in which all beings enjoy equal rights. By creating the three worlds, Hughes attempts to heal the dissimilation of human spiritual world and materialization of humanity, reconstruct the harmonious relationship between man and nature and finally help modem people out of their worries and dilemmas..									0	0	0	0	0	1003-7519		WOS:000333726600013		
J	Aristodemou, Maria								A Constant Craving for Fresh Brains and a Taste for Decaffeinated Neighbours								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW				25	1			35	58		10.1093/ejil/cht080			FEB 2014	2014	This article is a radical rethinking of public international law through the use of Lacanian psychoanalysis. Its central thesis is that while contemporary scholarship addresses what Lacan calls the symbolic and imaginary registers including law, politics, and ideology, it continues to ignore and repress the dimension of the real. The article illustrates this with a clinical example examined by Kris and discussed by Lacan. Imagining public international law as an indefatigable neurotic in search of 'fresh brains', the article shows why meeting her in the domains of law and politics is not enough to satiate her appetite. What continues to resist is the 'extimate', the inhuman element within the human that the subject hides so well from herself that it is excluded in the interior. A major instance of the extimate is the 'caffeinated neighbour', that is, the neighbour who is not in our image because her disturbing core has not been subtracted. The article argues that unless international law comes to terms with this inevitably ugly and obscene core, in oneself as well as in the neighbour, it cannot hope to achieve any meaningful changes. That the need to recognize the extimate is the ethical demand facing international law now; unless we address it, our symptoms will continue to grow and we will continue to crave fresh brains.									0	0	0	0	0	0938-5428		WOS:000334912300005

This article argues that this modern art of governing is now coming undone, in the name of governance. The discourse on governance is taking us from an art of governing premised on producing policy for a society or a population to an art of governing premised on solving problems with no necessary reference to any kind of society or population. Tracing the evolution of that discourse, the article argues that existing social and political theory has failed to make sense of this shift. It concludes that in order to access and assess the new art of governing on its own terms we need a sociological imagination that stretches beyond societies and a political imaginary without the presupposition of collectivities.									1	0	0	0	1	1368-4310		WOS:000336245500004

Discourse analysis of interviews, hearings, and official documents in the two cases demonstrates how the 'innocence' and 'best interests' of children are produced through three specific forms of knowledge: age, generational ordering, and most significantly, cultural readings of Chinese kinship. By examining the two cases of relative adoption and unaccompanied refugee claimants next to each other, the article reveals some of the institutional discourses through which childhood is constructed in the socio-legal discretionary power over immigration. The study also considers how the flexible deployment of conceptualizations of childhood, especially imaginaries of culturally 'other' kinship and childhood, serve the production of the nation-state.									0	0	0	0	0	0907-5682		WOS:000337970300004

I argue specifically that representations of a variety of eastern European national musics were often received equivocally, for a number of different signifieds were potentially implied by a shared set of stylistic signifiers. Such representations may best be understood not as imitations of discrete national styles but as translations of the broader perception of eastern Europe and of its music as rooted in an undoubtedly largely imaginary past. The translation into music of the ideology of folkloristic simplicity, naturalness, and artlessness, furthermore, was a very marketable one, catering to the tastes and abilities of amateurs in a way that imitations of specific national musics could not have done.									0	0	0	0	0	0027-4224		WOS:000342720000004		
J	Lyon, David								Surveillance and the Eye of God								STUDIES IN CHRISTIAN ETHICS				27	1			21	32		10.1177/0953946813509334			FEB 2014	2014	Surveillance is sometimes spoken of as a God's eye view of the world. This idea is explored in relation to the 'objective gaze' of disengaged reason in the Enlightenment and its technologically-reinforced modes in the twenty-first century. The rise of the eye-centred viewpoint is coincident with the 'great disembedding' of individuals from the social. This in turn also prompted the self-disciplines of modernity, which are now key aspects of the power-base of modern institutions. A crucial moment in this shift was Bentham's panopticon proposal, in which the knowledge regime of secularism started to shape social imaginaries in relation to surveillance. While secular omniscience was sought through the surveillance gaze, and explored later in the work of Foucault, Debord and others, the eye-centred view is not without critics. We draw upon some biblical resources, notably, the story of Hagar, that query the centrality of 'objective vision'. Instead, an ethic of care is proposed, based in part on a fresh understanding of the 'eye of God'. It is argued that the implications of the care ethic go far deeper than current appeals to privacy, data protection, civil liberties or human rights.									0	0	0	0	0	0953-9468		WOS:000344200500002

Non-citizens have become problems. The postcolonial settler nation-states - Australia, Canada, the USA and others - were 'founded' by immigrants and refugees who moved globally to become citizens in these 'new lands'. Such countries were made by migrants displacing indigenous others. However, in a conflict-ridden world in which the displacement of persons has become endemic - and in a media-connected world where the possibility of finding a better place to live has become increasingly imaginable and desired - these countries are now attempting to manage that global flow of people by stringent homeland security measures that are becoming increasingly problematic. While they are constituted through the modern imaginary of liberal democratic norms, human rights and rule of law, in each country over the last few years, rules have been bent, breached or bolstered in order to keep people out. The essay argues that given the globalization of people movement, the nation-state has reached the limits of responding though unilateral or even regional multilateral arrangements.									0	0	0	0	0	1362-1025		WOS:000334333600008		
J	Schwerin, Belinda; Paliwal, Kuldip								Using STFT real and imaginary parts of modulation signals for MMSE-based speech enhancement								SPEECH COMMUNICATION				58				49	68		10.1016/j.specom.2013.11.001			MAR 2014	2014	In this paper we investigate an alternate, RI-modulation (R = real, I = imaginary) AMS framework for speech enhancement, in which the real and imaginary parts of the modulation signal are processed in secondary AMS procedures. This framework offers theoretical advantages over the previously proposed modulation AMS frameworks in that noise is additive in the modulation signal and noisy acoustic phase is not used to reconstruct speech. Using the MMSE magnitude estimation to modify modulation magnitude spectra, initial experiments presented in this work evaluate if these advantages translate into improvements in processed speech quality. The effect of speech presence uncertainty and log-domain processing on MMSE magnitude estimation in the RI-modulation framework is also investigated. Finally, a comparison of different enhancement approaches applied in the RI-modulation framework is presented. Using subjective and objective experiments as well as spectrogram analysis, we show that RI-modulation MMSE magnitude estimation with speech presence uncertainty produces stimuli which has a higher preference by listeners than the other RI-modulation types. In comparisons to similar approaches in the modulation AMS framework, results showed that the theoretical advantages of the RI-modulation framework did not translate to an improvement in overall quality, with both frameworks yielding very similar sounding stimuli, but a clear improvement (compared to the corresponding modulation AMS based approach) in speech intelligibility was found.

J	Leduc, Christian								The Epistemological Functions of Symbolization in Leibniz's Universal Characteristic								FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENCE				19	1	SI		53	68		10.1007/s10699-012-9315-6			MAR 2014	2014	Leibniz's universal characteristic is a fundamental aspect of his theory of cognition. Without symbols or characters it would be difficult for the human mind to define several concepts and to achieve many demonstrations. In most disciplines, and particularly in mathematics, the mind must then focus on symbols and their combinatorial rules rather than on mental contents. For Leibniz, mental perception is most of the time too confused for attaining distinct notions and valid deductions. In this paper, I argue that the functions of symbolization differ depending upon the kind of concepts that are replaced with characters. In my view, most commentators did not sufficiently underline the distinction between two main functions of formal substitution in Leibniz's characteristic: either increasing our knowledge or simply structuring it. In the first case, we complete our knowledge because formal substitution makes sensible and imaginary concepts more distinct. In the second case, symbolization helps to organize contents that are already conceived of by reason. Thus the process of substitution is not always identically applicable, for symbols replace different types of concepts.									0	0	0	0	0	1233-1821		WOS:000331006500004		
J	Enright, Theresa Erin								Illuminating the Path to Grand Pari(s): Architecture and Urban Transformation in an Era of Neoliberalization								ANTIPODE				46	2			382	403		10.1111/anti.12048			MAR 2014	2014	This article examines the architectural exhibition associated with the large-scale Grand Paris urban development project initiated in 2007 by French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Through a close examination of the exhibition, I argue that imaginative representation is crucial to urban transformation, here acting to justify and naturalize neoliberal reforms. While the ten international teams of architects tasked with imagining twenty-first century Paris presented sometimes radical scenarios, the architectural proposals are also used by the state to secure a sense of regional coherence, to reaffirm the imperative of economic growth, and to deny broad sociospatial conflict. The futural aspect of speculative regional development is redoubled in the prospective architectural visions, thus solidifying the dominance of a marketized mode of urbanization. While this cooption of architectural designs emerges from the unique circumstances of contemporary Paris, it also speaks to the broader promise and limits of imaginative urbanism and large-scale architectural intervention.									0	0	0	0	0	0066-4812		WOS:000331247200004

Case Study: Bucharest Municipality								REVISTA DE CERCETARE SI INTERVENTIE SOCIALA				44				86	102					MAR 2014	2014	Urban spaces cannot be dissociated from the constructions of the social or imaginary space. The resulting representations articulate on repulsiveness and attractiveness attributes. Based on a humanistic geographical approach, the aim of this article is to identify those representations, playing on the relationship between repulsive urban spaces and the social deviance, as an attribute of the social space. The repulsive urban spaces are embedded themselves on the collective imaginary of a perceived offence as well as on the presence of incivilities. The study used the data obtained from face to face questionnaire survey on 1,176 persons. The results of the applied multiple regression analysis showed that the urban spaces' unsafeness is not closely dependent on the urban incivilities' impact or the sanitation or cleaning of the public spaces. Overall, the poor quality of life within the city, the negative image of the neighbourhoods/derelict built urban environment were the most predictable variables for estimating the urban unsafeness.									0	0	0	0	0	1583-3410		WOS:000332682000005

Participants had to imagine riding a motorcycle with either a son or a workmate as a passenger. Their task was to assess the risk of accident in a set of traffic scenarios. Risk perception was a function of sex and type of passenger. Women perceived higher risk when the passenger was a son than when a workmate. In contrast, men's estimations were rather the same for both passengers. The emotional significance of the consequences of the accident (losing a son vs. losing a workmate) modulate the perception of probability of having an accident. Finally, these results could help in designing more effective campaigns promoting road safety. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.									0	0	0	0	0	0888-4080		WOS:000333017900012		
J	Goulding, Robert								Thomas Harriot's optics, between experiment and imagination: the case of Mr Bulkeley's glass								ARCHIVE FOR HISTORY OF EXACT SCIENCES				68	2			137	178		10.1007/s00407-013-0125-1			MAR 2014	2014	Some time in the late 1590s, the Welsh amateur mathematician John Bulkeley wrote to Thomas Harriot asking his opinion about the properties of a truly gargantuan (but totally imaginary) plano-spherical convex lens, 48 feet in diameter. While Bulkeley's original letter is lost, Harriot devoted several pages to the optical properties of "Mr Bulkeley his Glasse" in his optical papers (now in British Library MS Add. 6789), paying particular attention to the place of its burning point. Harriot's calculational methods in these papers are almost unique in Harriot's optical remains, in that he uses both the sine law of refraction and interpolation from Witelo's refraction tables in order to analyze the passage of light through the glass. For this and other reasons, it is very likely that Harriot wrote his papers on Bulkeley's glass very shortly after his discovery of the law and while still working closely with Witelo's great Optics; the papers represent, perhaps, his very first application of the law. His and Bulkeley's interest in this giant glass conform to a long English tradition of curiosity about the optical and burning properties of large glasses, which grew more intense in late sixteenth-century England. In particular, Thomas Digges's bold and widely known assertions about his father's glasses that could see things several miles distant and could burn objects a half-mile or further away may have attracted Harriot and Bulkeley's skeptical attention; for Harriot's analysis of the burning distance and the intensity of Bulkeley's fantastic lens, it shows that Digges's claims could never have been true about any real lens (and this, I propose, was what Bulkeley had asked about in his original letter to Harriot). There was also a deeper, mathematical relevance to the problem that may have caught Harriot's attention. His most recent source on refraction-Giambattista della Porta's De refractione of 1593-identified a mathematical flaw in Witelo's cursory suggestion about the optics of a lens (the only place that lenses appear, however fleetingly, in the writings of the thirteenth-century Perspectivist authors). In his early notes on optics, in a copy of Witelo's optics, Harriot highlighted Witelo's remarks on the lens and della Porta's criticism (which he found unsatisfactory). The most significant problem with Witelo's theorem would disappear as the radius of curvature of the lens approached infinity. Bulkeley's gigantic glass, then, may have provided Harriot an opportunity to test out Witelo's claims about a plano-spherical glass, at a time when he was still intensely concerned with the problems and methods of the Perspectivist school.									0	0	0	0	0	0003-9519		WOS:000332949200002		
J	Koch, Lars; Nanz, Tobias								Aesthetic Experiments. The Function of Disruption in Art								LILI-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR LITERATURWISSENSCHAFT UND LINGUISTIK				44	173			94	115					MAR 2014	2014	Disruption is a phenomenon that has gained the attention of a broad and diverse range of academic disciplines. Building on this work we propose that disruptions are by no means solely destructive but rather have productive consequences. We aim to establish disruption as a starting point for the analysis of formulas of societal self-description. In this, epistemological and aesthetic aspects of disturbances will be focused since these moments of interruption or loss of order evoke efforts of theoretical or practical consolidation of the social sphere. After discussing the history of experimentalization of the life sciences, we point out how art can be understood as an experimental system that integrates and explores the function of disruption. Second, the relationship between factual and fictional knowledge and how both impact on society through the fabrication of different worlds are to be questioned. Finally, we will argue that art such as literature, film, modern theatre, or performances use disruptions as a tool, with which the perception of the past, present and future and of the society itself can be shaped. They achieve this by employing powerfully repercussive narratives that construct political and socio-cultural coherence through the symbolic re-integration of imaginary or real disruptive incidents.									0	0	0	0	0	0049-8653		WOS:000332920600006		
J	Elza, Cary								Alice in Cartoonland: Childhood, Gender, and Imaginary Space in Early Disney Animation								ANIMATION-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL				9	1			7	26		10.1177/1746847714520936			MAR 2014	2014	The 'plasmatic' world of Mickey Mouse famously enchanted everyone from small children to European filmmakers and philosophers in the late 1920s and 1930s, but Disney's attempts to use media technology to envision the freedom of childhood imagination can be traced back to his first successful series, the Alice Comedies (1923-1927), which featured a live-action girl who navigated animated wonderlands in her dreams and her imagination. Like Lewis Carroll's original character, Disney's Alice acts as a conduit into an irrational and magical world - the opposite of rational life in modernity. For Disney, Alice provided a way to both tie his own cultural productions to a long tradition of beloved children's literature, and present his own vision of an animated wonderland as coming from the innocent perspective of a little girl. At the series' outset, Alice's trips to Cartoonland were motivated by live-action framing stories that depicted children at play, inviting audiences young and old to escape to a world of childhood imagination. But Disney didn't just depict an idealized childhood in live-action film; he also used animation to gesture toward the existence of a universal, unassailable imaginary space. This emphasis on the child's perspective in rendering the relationship between real and animated space speaks to larger cultural concerns at the time surrounding early education, psychological development, and the importance of protecting childhood in an increasingly rationalized world. This article examines the way childhood play is figured in both live-action and animated space in the first series of Alice cartoons - as mimicry, as performance, and as transformation of 'real' space - in order to show that Disney's early work owed much of its impact to the ability of media technology to represent an idealized version of children's imaginative play, and to evoke childhood perception through the use of animation.									0	0	0	0	0	1746-8477		WOS:000332844500002

Biopolitics and Disposable Bodies A Critical Reading of Almazan's Entre perros								LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES				41	2			189	201		10.1177/0094582X13509799			MAR 2014	2014	Until now, little has been said about Mexican literature's relationship with drug trafficking. While the literature influenced by drug trafficking may be seen as opportunistic and as promoting the dissolution of society and advocating crime, it not only contributes to the reproduction of the current violent Mexican imaginary but also appears to question the political and economic decentralization of neoliberalism and its role in making human beings disposable. Examining an example of this genre, Alejandro Almazan's Entre perros (2009), in terms of the concept of biopolitics developed by Michel Foucault and others reveals it to be a denunciation of the effects of drug trafficking on Mexican society. The narconarrative raises the possibility of thinking about a state in which ethics and human rights are attainable. Hasta ahora poco se ha dicho de la relacion entre la literatura mexicana y el narcotrafico. Mientras se puede ver la literatura influenciada por el narcotrafico como oportunista y promotora de la disolucion social y alendador del crimen, no solo contribuye a la reproduccion del imaginario violento mexicano, sino parece cuestionar la decentralizacion politica y economica del neoliberalismo y su rol en hacer desechables a los seres humanos. Examinando un ejemplo de este genero, Entre Perros de Alejandro Almazan (2009), en terminos del concepto de biopolitica desarrollada por Michel Foucault y otros lo revela como una denuncia del efecto del narcotrafico en la sociedad mexicana. La narconarrativa plantea la posibilidad de pensar en un estado en donde son alcanzables la etica y los derechos humanos.									0	0	0	0	0	0094-582X		WOS:000331621000012

In particular, it teases out a more explicit "civilizational politics" line of research, which builds upon latent and underdeveloped themes in the civilizational turn in IR. "Civilizational politics" offers an avenue for theoretically inclined, empirically minded scholars to explore how social and political actors have come to understand, change, and construct world politics as if plural civilizations existed and their relations mattered. The article anchors "civilizational politics" research to a modernist-constructivist approach to IR and structures it around two key steps. The first step is to recover and interpret subjective and intersubjective meanings through participants' discourse. The article proposes an understanding of civilizations as "imagined communities" narrated by political and intellectual elites: as essentialized or non-essentialized entities; and as clashing/conflicting or dialoguing/engaging with each other. The second step outlines three causal pathways that explain how narrated civilizational imaginaries affect world politics and turn civilizations into social facts: by guiding and structuring social action; by shaping and becoming embedded in formal institutions and patterned practices; and by bestowing recognition and socially empowering actors claiming to speak for civilizations. The empirical import of a "civilizational politics" line of research is demonstrated through a re-reading of Turan Kayaoglu's article "Constructing the Dialogue of Civilizations in World Politics: A Case of Global Islamic Activism."									0	0	0	0	0	1521-9488		WOS:000334414400001

The consequence of this transformation in life expectancy however has led to a set of contradictory responses, representing threats as much as opportunities. Old age is no longer a stable coherent part of the life course; its future is fragmented by the competing narratives of the third age (opportunity) and the fourth age (threat). While there is a tendency to frame this distinction primarily through the lens of socio-demography and/or 'stages of life,' this paper proposes an alternative model. This model argues that later life is now represented through two different, though not unrelated, paradigms. The first frames the third age as a network of cultural fields dominated by rising consumerism and changing social relationships, while the second frames the fourth age as a negatively developed social imaginary of 'real old age.' The central features of this imaginary, we suggest, are frailty, abjection and the 'othering' of the self. This paper elaborates this theorising of the fourth age, briefly outlining each of these three features before considering in more detail the nature of othering and its consequences for those affected by this particular imaginary.									1	0	0	0	1	1446-1242		WOS:000336082600002		
J	Cervinka, Renate; Roederer, Kathrin; Haemmerle, Isabella								EVALUATION OF HOSPITAL GARDENS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR DESIGN: BENEFITS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY FOR ARCHITECTURE AND LANDSCAPE PLANNING								JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL AND PLANNING RESEARCH				31	1			43	56					SPR 2014	2014	Healthcare environments have a high potential for causing stress to patients, visitors, and staff Hospital gardens serve as natural environments that can play an important role in counterbalancing high stress levels, enhancing well-being, and supporting healing. The first aim of this study is to assess the perceived restorative qualities of hospital gardens for staff and potential patients and visitors. Second, the study aims to develop recommendations for upgrading existing hospital gardens to restorative ones and designing new healing gardens. Four gardens from three hospitals in Lower Austria were rated by 411 participants in an online questionnaire and by 28 staff members from the hospitals in a series of workshops. Participants evaluated the gardens regarding their appearance and restorative qualities using semantic differential (SD) and additional psychological rating scales. They also evaluated an imaginary ideal hospital garden for restoration, which served as a reference. The most natural garden was rated closest to the reference garden and scored highest for restoration. SD factor analyses revealed six factors that are relevant for design: mood, well-being, nature, mysticism, tranquility, and sense of touch. Based on the findings, we developed recommendations for the (re)design of hospital gardens, which can be used by architects, planners, administrators, and researchers of healthcare facilities to improve healing gardens at hospitals. The method presented in this paper allows for the evaluation of existing hospital gardens, comparison of gardens regarding their appearance and restorative potential, and (re)design of hospital gardens.

J	De Mul, Sarah								Becoming black in Belgium: The social construction of blackness in Chika Unigwe's authorial self-representation and On Black Sisters' Street								JOURNAL OF COMMONWEALTH LITERATURE				49	1			11	27		10.1177/0021989413516120			MAR 2014	2014	In the satirical column entitled "Zwart worden in zeven lessen" (Becoming Black in Seven Lessons), the Nigerian-Belgian writer Chika Unigwe considers black identity as a social construction and coming to Europe as an entry to a social imaginary, a discursive space where subjects are already imagined, constructed and treated as "black" by hegemonic discourses. Using Becoming Black in Seven Lessons as a starting point, in this essay I explore the social construction of black identity in relation to, on the one hand, Unigwe's authorial self-representation as an ethnic minority writer in Flanders (the Dutch language region of Belgium) and, on the other hand, the identity negotiations of the African immigrant women in the Flemish city of Antwerp in Unigwe's second novel On Black Sisters' Street. Central to this inquiry will be the question of how the author Unigwe on the one hand and the African sex workers in On Black Sisters' Street become black in Belgium and how they negotiate a sense of self vis-a-vis the already pronounced social order. I argue more specifically that their self-representations reveal the mediation of dominant historical images and Western symbolic meanings and their attempts to wrest control of the construction of their bodies away from the distorted visions of dominant culture. Without conflating Unigwe's situation as a black middle-class author in the Flemish literary field with the position of the four Nigerian women working in the sex industry described in the book, parallels can be drawn between them, as I wish to contend, in the ways in which their agency is established in the performance of cultural configurations of black identity which have seized hegemonic hold.									0	0	0	0	0	0021-9894		WOS:000331862700002		
J	Pype, Katrien								Religion, migration et esthetique des medias.

The author shows that the triad of migration, religion and media liberalization is dialectically related to the emergence of a new social and moral imaginary that, in its turn, has facilitated the reception of << Nollywood >> films in Kinshasa. These films have become an intrinsic part of Kinois charismatic Christianity, partly because of local forms of power and authority and, in particular, because of the new position of authority charismatic leaders have acquired. In fact, most of the latter obtained their position because of their familiarity with and proximity to Nigerian Pentecostal-Charismatic Christianity. The author thus demonstrates how migration and the Christian renewal have transformed the Kinois mediascape in different and unprecedented ways.Resume Kinshasa, les films provenant du Nigeria constituent un genre tres populaire. L'auteure montre que le triangle entre migration, religion et liberalisation des medias est relie dialectiquement au surgissement d'un nouvel imaginaire social et moral, lequel, a son tour, a facilite la reception des films << nollywoodiens >> a Kinshasa. Les films importes du Nigeria sont devenus des objets encastres dans le christianisme charismatique. Semblable insertion dans les cultures audiovisuelles prend forme selon les structures locales d'autorite et de pouvoir, et en particulier selon la nouvelle position d'autorite des pasteurs charismatiques. La plupart de ces nouveaux leaders chretiens ont acquis ce statut du fait, a la fois, de leur proximite a la culture chretienne nigeriane. Ainsi, l'auteure montre comment la migration et le renouveau chretien ont transforme, a Kinshasa, le monde des medias locaux de facons diverses et inedites.									0	0	0	0	0	0037-7686		WOS:000331862800004

The use as a noun of the adjective (for which an equivalent is now in use in most European languages) developed at the end of the 19th century, but the theoretical apparatus using the term dates from the 40s and 50s. After Sartre, Bachelard, Blanchot, Lacan (and then many others) grabbed hold of a term which has since become a key word of the human sciences at the acme of their prestige.After the "hunt on the imaginary" set forth by the Theory of the 60s and 70s, and the banalisation of the term, it seems to be declining in use in contemporary academia. Such is the moment chosen by the industries of the imaginary to start on its "modelisation".									0	0	0	0	0	0047-4800		WOS:000336947300007

It argues that the author's depiction of the region not only relies - often quite heavily - on the general discourse suggesting an essential difference between Europe's West and East, but also reflects, more specifically, concerns and apprehensions characteristic of Italian political and cultural life in the last decade of the twentieth century, caused in particular by separatist tendencies in the North and the ascent to power of the far-right. The essay contends that despite Rumiz's knowledge of the region and his attempts to grasp and understand the predicaments and complexities of the places visited, the author's depiction of Eastern Europe remains highly reductive and reiterates the cultural discourse which construes the region as the West's imaginary Other and its repressed cultural alter ego.									0	0	0	0	0	0075-1634		WOS:000337066800010		
J	Mills, Charles W.								WHITE TIME The Chronic Injustice of Ideal Theory								DU BOIS REVIEW-SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH ON RACE				11	1			27	42		10.1017/S1742058X14000022			SPR 2014	2014	The racialization of space is the subject of a huge body of literature, most recently in George Lipsitz's (2011) How Racism Takes Place. But less has been done on the ways in which time could be racialized. Inspired by provocative treatments of the subject in writings by Michael Hanchard (1999) and Lawrie Balfour (2011), I suggest in this paper that we need to explore the workings of a "White temporal imaginary" analogous to Lipsitz's "White spatial imaginary," which likewise serves to protect White racial privilege from the threatening encroachments of racial justice. Using Eviatar Zerubavel's (2003) Time Maps as a jumping-off point, I argue accordingly for the recognition of a " White time," a " sociomental" representation of temporality shaped by the interests and experience of the White " mnemonic community." The concept is obviously one of potentially very general usefulness, but in this essay I seek to apply it specifically to the dominant discourse on justice in political philosophy, as framed for the past forty years by John Rawls' ([1971] 1999c) "ideal theory." The relevance to the postracial theme of this issue is that, because of the peculiarity of philosophy as a discipline, it can claim it was always, or always-already, postracial, dealing as it ostensibly does with the (timeless) human condition as such. By making ideal theory-the normative theory of a perfectly just society-central to the conceptualization of social justice, by never exploring how radically different actual societies are from the ideal of society as " a cooperative venture for mutual advantage," an exclusionary sociohistorical framework is established that makes the Euro-time of the West-abstracted out of the West's relations of domination over people of color-the Greenwich Mean Time of normativity, while the alternative non-White temporality of structurally unjust societies requiring rectificatory racial justice remains a subject permanently untimely.									0	0	0	0	0	1742-058X		WOS:000340416400003

While there is a growing interest in the social sciences for prediction, future imaginaries and the governance of risk, few studies have examined historically the integration of the category of the future' or the long term' in political systems in the postwar years, a period in which this category took on specific meaning and importance. We suggest that governing the long-term posed fundamental problems to particular societal models of expertise, decision-making and public participation. We argue that the scientific and political claim to govern the future was fundamentally contested, and that social struggle around the role and content of predictive expertise determined how the long term was incorporated into different systems of knowledge production and policy-making.									0	0	0	0	0	0734-1512		WOS:000341649100006

J	Meacham, Sarah S.								THE ALTERNATION OF DESU/-MASU WITH PLAIN FORM SPEECH AND THE CONSTITUTION OF SOCIAL CLASS IN JAPANESE HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH LESSONS								PRAGMATICS				24	1			83	104					MAR 2014	2014	This article explores the alternation of honorific language (desu/-masu) and plain form language within English language lessons in Japanese high schools. It argues that, within such educational contexts, alternation of these different ways of speaking are perspective-shifting routines, to which their indexical meanings are related. I suggest that in a liberal arts high school, the alternation of forms amounts to an analytical practice within which desu/-masu highlights abstract knowledge and plain form frames participants' involvement in imaginary event situations within which the contingent use of English can be theorized. In contrast, in a technical high school, the alternation of forms amounts to an identity problematizing practice, in which desu/-masu indexes a speaker's intrapersonal distance from typical "school-like" roles and activities, and plain form indexes an authentic, Japanese insider identity in the face of learning English. These different perspective-taking routines socialize very different relationships between self and school, and, in particular, between self and resources such as second language proficiency, and are thus an arena for the reproduction of social class distinctions.									0	0	0	0	0	1018-2101		WOS:000348310400004

A major reason for the lack of social and political engagement on this issue is the way in which political myths function to overcome the contradiction of environmental degradation and endless economic growth. Through a qualitative analysis of Australian business responses to climate change, we outline how the myths of corporate environmentalism, corporate citizenship, and corporate omnipotence absorb and adapt the critique of corporate capitalism while enabling ever more imaginative ways of exploiting nature - a process of 'creative self-destruction'. Rather than seeking to falsify these myths, we explore how they are supported and what they seek to achieve - the work of myths. Revealing the nature of current political myths in relation to climate change is, we argue, a necessary first step to constructing alternative imaginaries.									1	0	0	0	1	0964-4016		WOS:000332274900002

Drawing upon project documentation and research plans from 1986 to 2012, and 10 interviews with researchers involved in project design and implementation, we trace how these projects have represented the problem of global change in the modelling of ecosystem and land-use dynamics. The imagining of global change was recalibrated as project participants brought more aspects of natural and human life into their computations. A top-down gaze informed by atmospheric physics and predictable cause-effect relationships gave way to a more complex Anthropocene imaginary dominated by non-linearity and less predictable thresholds and pathways. Given intrinsic links between ways of representing and knowing a phenomenon and ways of acting upon it so as to transform it, qualitative change in how the Earth System is 'rendered problematic' may imply changes for the practices of environmental science and governance.									1	0	0	0	1	0964-4016		WOS:000332274900009		
J	Encheva, Lyuba; Pedersen, Isabel								'One Day horizontal ellipsis ': Google's Project Glass, integral reality and predictive advertising								CONTINUUM-JOURNAL OF MEDIA & CULTURAL STUDIES				28	2	SI		235	246		10.1080/10304312.2013.854874			MAR 4 2014	2014	In the spring of 2012, Google unveiled 'Project Glass' with the promise to deliver an augmented reality head-mounted display device to the masses. Its YouTube video 'One Day horizontal ellipsis ', viewed more than 20 million times, promotes a utopian vision of what life will be like once this prototype becomes available to everyone. Using a critical humanities approach, this paper uses this event as a site to consider the implications of predictive advertising as a rising cultural phenomenon within the public imagination. Predictive advertising can be described as a new hybrid form of communication, which capitalizes both on the enigmatic appeal of futuristic techno-fantasies and the realism of the advertisement as a reference to an external fact. This rhetorical manoeuvre resembles Jean Baudrillard's assertions that culture has fallen victim to 'integral reality' whereby real and imaginary are no longer distinct. We pinpoint this transformation within this age of network culture and mass adoption of new mobile and wearable devices, suggesting that 'announcing the future' is an activity that rightfully deserves a genre of its own under the label predictive advertising.									0	0	0	0	0	1030-4312		WOS:000333949000008		
J	Philippe, Tanguy								Wrestling Styles and the Cultural Reinterpretation Process								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF SPORT				31	4	SI		492	508		10.1080/09523367.2013.869218			MAR 4 2014	2014	Wrestling is a worldwide activity, defined by some universal logics and taking various forms. There are many geographically or culturally based wrestling styles that are generally considered traditional. Wrestling itself is the signifier of different dimensions, being altogether a challenge, a cultural element and a liminal interaction between the imaginary and the body. It is an example of body culture considered as a collective symbolic wealth, diffused by the reputation of some techniques and the association with some cultural or social groups. The notion of tradition is associated with the sports and rooted in a customary and cross-generational mode of transmission. This paper examines the cases of kurash (Uzbekistan), gouren (Brittany, France) and kokh (Armenia), three wrestling styles that recently experienced or are still experiencing an institutionalisation process. These symptomatic wrestling styles face the question of conciliating uniqueness and adaptation to the cultural framework of sport. In addition, they constitute forms of symbolic capital and signifiers of different values, which adds the question of cultural legitimacy to sport management.									0	0	0	0	0	0952-3367		WOS:000334061000007		
J	Costa, Rosalina Pisco								Backpacks, driving, fun and farewell: examining the ritual experience of the weekend amongst non-resident parents and their children								LEISURE STUDIES				33	2	SI		164	184		10.1080/02614367.2013.833287			MAR 4 2014	2014	If not in reality, then in the cultural imaginary of Western society, the weekend is often pictured as a pilgrimage site for families. By particularly focusing on the experience of the weekend amongst non-resident parents and their child(ren), this article offers a simultaneously new and innovative gaze on the issue. Drawing on middle-class non-resident parents' accounts collected through episodic interviews, it explores the beginning, the middle and the ending of those fortnightly weekends. Making use of a qualitative approach, key moments of anticipation, experience and farewell are examined, and the main features highlighted. Using a sociological perspective, the findings suggest that whilst outside the week, its promise is to synchronise everyone under a same family clock in the view of a quality' and special' time; inside the weekend, non-resident parents and their children experience a family ritual. In between the expectation and joy in the anticipation and the sadness and the sorrow of farewell, a different' time disrupts the daily life, and imprints a unique' and special' occasion. Always ephemeral, the weekend is, thus, unveiled as a liminal time span, not least as far as post-separation parenting is concerned. ??????,??????????,???????????????????????????????????????,??????????????????????????????????????????,????????,??????????????, ????????,?????????,???????????????,???????,???????????????'????'??????????,??????????????????????????????,???????????,???????????'???'?????????,??,?????????????????????????									0	0	0	0	0	0261-4367		WOS:000333870800005		
J	Gorrillot, Benedicte								Pascal Quignard ou le faux melange des genres dans le roman latin Les Tablettes de buis d'Apronenia Avitia								CONTEMPORARY FRENCH AND FRANCOPHONE STUDIES				18	2	SI		158	166		10.1080/17409292.2014.900926			MAR 15 2014	2014	Published six years before Albucius (1990), Les Tablettes de buis d'Apronenia Avitia (1984) belongs to the "roman novels" declared by Pascal Quignard hybridizing different literary genres. In 1984, when he speaks of this kind of writting, the author doesn't call it yet "satura" (as later in 1990), but "miscellenea" that cross in particular historical vita with buxi ("tablets"). This essay studies those categorizations and shows that, if the French writer uses old genres, as usual he changes them in his own peculiar manner and builds an imaginary composite latin novel, that doesn't melt but accumulates, without hiding the frictions, many pseudo-antique heterogeneous literary types, just like the human modern and problematic subject he is at this time.									0	0	0	0	0	1740-9292		WOS:000334906600008

Both cases borrow ideologies of childhood from contemporary American culture and ideas of technological potential from computer cultures. The developers and organizers in these two groups ground the resulting narrative in their own childhood experiences and their desire to provide the same kinds of experiences to children today. We highlight some of the dimensions of this narrative as well as some of its limitations in appealing to, and re-creating, a particular kind of child that resembles the organizers themselves: technically inclined, often oppositional, and often male. These cases highlight both the prevalence and limitations of using childhood ideologies in the design process by showing how these particular versions of childhood are enlisted to frame technological development and the social programs that promote it.									1	0	0	0	1	1369-118X		WOS:000331520500006

By offering GPs a platform to present and discuss difficult interactions with patients, Balint group work be might provide them an opportunity to explore and articulate aspects of their subjectivity. In order to get a more profound understanding of what participation in a Balint group can offer, we focused on the process of change that can be observed during Balint group meetings. To that end, this study scrutinized two Balint group case discussions on a micro-level.Method: Two cases were selected from a larger data set of 68 audio-taped case discussions in four Balint groups. In order to shed light on the type of change that characterizes the presenter's narrative, we used Lacan's theoretical distinction between imaginary and symbolic modes of relating to the other.Results: In both case discussions, the GPs presenting the case initially appeared to be stuck in a fixed image of a situation, referred to as ` imaginary relating to the other.'Through a range of interactions with the group, the presenters were encouraged to explore different subject positions, which allowed them to broaden their initial image of the situation and to discover other issues at stake. This was referred to as a more symbolic way of relating to the other.Conclusion: This study throws light on the type of change Balint group participation allows for and on the way this might be achieved. We conclude that Balint group work is potentially beneficial to the participating GPs as well as to the relationship with their patients.									0	0	0	0	0	1471-2296		WOS:000334703300001	24655833

Six experiments explore the role of shape and spatial orientation of the trajectory of a point-light target in the perceptual judgment of uniform motion. In Experiment 1, the target oscillated back-and-forth along a circular arc around an invisible pivot. The imaginary segment from the pivot to the midpoint of the trajectory could be oriented vertically downward (consistent with an upright pendulum), horizontally leftward, or vertically upward (upside-down). In Experiments 2 to 5, the target moved uni-directionally. The effect of suppressing the alternation of movement directions was tested with curvilinear (Experiment 2 and 3) or rectilinear (Experiment 4 and 5) paths. Experiment 6 replicated the upright condition of Experiment 1, but participants were asked to hold the gaze on a fixation point. When some features of the trajectory evoked the motion of either a simple pendulum or a mass-spring system, observers identified as uniform the kinematic profiles close to harmonic motion. The bias towards harmonic motion was most consistent in the upright orientation of Experiment 1 and 6. The bias disappeared when the stimuli were incompatible with both pendulum and mass-spring models (Experiments 3 to 5). The results are compatible with the hypothesis that the perception of dynamic stimuli is biased by the laws of motion obeyed by natural events, so that only natural motions appear uniform.									2	0	2	0	2	1932-6203		WOS:000333675600128	24667578

REC chairpersons' opinions on three imaginary cases of clinical research projects challenging current research ethics rules (vignettes) were requested with a questionnaire; 18 of the 22 interviewed chairpersons responded.Results: Based on REC chairpersons' interviews, the differences between care and research regulation were not considered important issues in Finland. In the vignettes, REC chairpersons' assumptions on how their REC would decide varied in regard to allowing research without informed consent, while solutions that are not allowed by current law were even anticipated. Mostly, but not always, the chairpersons' own personal view agreed with their REC.Conclusions: The distinction between care and research regulation has not been publicly challenged by Finnish RECs, even though it is a challenge when research relevant to health care is carried out. There is a need for debate and changes in laws and practices.									0	0	0	0	0	1478-4505		WOS:000334455000001	24666735

J	Mayes, Christopher								An Agrarian Imaginary in Urban Life: Cultivating Virtues and Vices Through a Conflicted History								JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS				27	2			265	286		10.1007/s10806-013-9463-x			APR 2014	2014	This paper explores the influence and use of agrarian thought on collective understandings of food practices as sources of ethical and communal value in urban contexts. A primary proponent of agrarian thought that this paper engages is Paul Thompson and his exceptional book, The Agrarian Vision. Thompson aims to use agrarian ideals of agriculture and communal life to rethink current issues of sustainability and environmental ethics. However, Thompson perceives the current cultural mood as hostile to agrarian virtue. There are two related claims of this paper. The first argues that contrary to Thompson's perception of hostility, agrarian thought is popularly and commercially mobilized among urban populations. To establish this claim I extend Charles Taylor's notion of a social imaginary and suggest that urban agriculture can be theorized as an agrarian imaginary. Entwined with the first claim is the second, that proponents selectively use agrarian history to overemphasis a narrative of virtue while ignoring or marginalizing historical practices of agrarian violence, exclusion and dispossession. I do not discount or deny the significance of agrarian virtue. By situating agrarian thought within a clearer virtue ethics framework and acknowledging potential manifestation of agrarian vice, I suggest that the idea of agrarian virtue is strengthened.									1	0	0	0	1	1187-7863		WOS:000333025800006

Modern Muslims and the Challenge of Plurality								SOCIETY				51	2			131	139		10.1007/s12115-014-9752-7			APR 2014	2014	Contrary to the earlier forecasts of secularization theory, religious practices and ethical imaginaries are flourishing across the Muslim world. But Muslim scholars and intellectuals disagree on the question of how to deal with the pluralization in mind and society that marks our age. This paper examines the ways in which contemporary Muslim engagements with religious plurality are discursively path dependent. The engagements are shaped by, on one hand, discourses long associated with Islamic ethics and law, and, on the other hand, circumstances extrinsic to this normative tradition that inform the way in which those internal discourses are selectively reconstructed in the face of modern plurality. The article suggests that, notwithstanding certain anti-pluralist currents, there is a growing community of Muslim intellectuals intent on engaging diversity in society by devising a "plurality in mind" that is still recognizably Islamic in method and message but accommodating of a higher degree of social diversity than was typical of classical Islamic discourses on religious "others.".									0	0	0	0	0	0147-2011		WOS:000332955400005

The essay begins by outlining how the cultural tradition of the west has tended to present marshes as marginal locations, and marshland landscapes as problematically ambiguous, and it shows how this characterization has influenced accounts of the Blackwater marshlands. I then introduce and examine the lives of Norman Angell and Tom Driberg: the former a Nobel Peace Prize winner, a solitary man for whom Northey Island provided a retreat from a threatening world; the latter a leftist politician and journalist, an extrovert who lived a colourful life in Bradwell on Sea. While both men came to the marshes as outsiders, they ended by making for themselves meaningful life geographies in the marshland, their struggles engaging with the symbolic, imaginary, and real components of the landscape. I conclude by proposing that Angell and Driberg's life geographies indicate that, like the marshlands, landscape might best be understood as neither necessarily solid nor liquid in identity, but as a contingent process formed by local negotiation.									0	0	0	0	0	1474-4740		WOS:000333454600002		
J	Needham, Gary								Bringing out the Gimp: Fashioning the SM Imaginary								FASHION THEORY-THE JOURNAL OF DRESS BODY & CULTURE				18	2	SI		149	168		10.2752/175174114X13890223974506			APR 2014	2014	The intention of this article is to investigate the cultural power associated with the gimp and the gimp mask. The gimp is a clothed or costumed Sadomasochistic (SM) body, frequently a submissive that often wears a leather or rubber costume that covers and effectuates the entire body including the face. The gimp is also a representation of SM that circulates throughout fashion and film and other forms of popular culture. Since the gimp's first outing and naming in the film Pulp Fiction it has become the byword for the head-to-toe leather SM look that has been appropriated by a number of designers as way of exploring and exploiting the relationship between fashion, fetishism, and transgression. As a counterpoint to the popular image of SM in fashion and film, this article also explores how the artists Catherine Opie and Robert Mapplethorpe have represented the gimp, not as an index of horror or transgressive style rather as an affirmative image of their own SM communities that, while still intended to shock, is a defiant attempt to rescue or reclaim the gimp from its negative associations.									0	0	0	0	0	1362-704X		WOS:000333572200003		
J	Marshall, Tim								Infrastructure futures and spatial planning: Lessons from France, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK								PROGRESS IN PLANNING				89				1	38		10.1016/j.progress.2013.03.003			APR 2014	2014	This monograph investigates the place of macro-scale spatial planning in steering infrastructure development in Europe. It starts from an examination of the way in which changes in the form of infrastructure development are driven by neo-liberalisation and changes in the political and constitutional forms of states. Macro-spatial planning, within states and at supra-national levels, has some role in steering major infrastructure, a role which is affected by the spatial ideas which actors have of the territories for which policy is being made. One focus is on the nature of such spatial imaginaries, and how this affects the abilities of democratic polities to project and debate their territorial futures.The paper examines four western European states as well as the reform of the European Union Trans-European Networks policy area. This analysis generates an understanding of the interplay of the material and ideational forces referred to above. This understanding is finally put to work to examine the possible scope to improve the working together of macro-spatial planning in one case, that of the UK, concentrating on England within this now plural jurisdiction. Efforts to promote a spatial framework for England have not been successful up to now, in part, it is suggested, because the neo-liberalising dynamics have constituted an almost insuperable barrier to even imagining spatially coherent futures for England. However this might be taken as a challenge by academics and practicising planners, amongst many others, to stretch the bounds of thinking, in part by drawing on current transition ideas and other story lines exploring and arguing for long term steered change.

THE INFLUENCE OF PRIMING ATTACHMENT STYLES ON EXCESSIVE REASSURANCE SEEKING AND NEGATIVE FEEDBACK SEEKING IN DEPRESSION								JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY				33	4			295	318					APR 2014	2014	Two studies examined the associations among attachment styles, excessive reassurance seeking (ERS) and negative feedback seeking (NFS) in depression. In Study 1 (n = 303), undergraduate students completed measures assessing attachment style, depressive symptoms, and ERS following either an imaginary interpersonal (friend and partner) or achievement prime. In Study 2 (n = 202), undergraduates completed the same measures in addition to completing an index of NFS following an imaginary interpersonal (partner) and achievement prime. Controlling for symptoms of depression, anxious attachment was positively related to ERS, and avoidant attachment was negatively related to ERS and positively associated with NFS. These results suggest that ERS and NFS may be a function of non-secure attachment rather than symptoms of depression per se. More specifically, anxiously attached individuals may attempt to reduce fears of abandonment by seeking reassurance from close others, whereas avoidantly attached individuals may strive to confirm negative perceptions of the self and relationships by seeking out unfavorable feedback from close others.									1	0	0	0	1	0736-7236		WOS:000334974500001

J	Chapman, Emma J.								Using dramatic reality to reduce depressive symptoms: A qualitative study								ARTS IN PSYCHOTHERAPY				41	2			137	144		10.1016/j.aip.2014.01.001			APR 2014	2014	The research surrounding the use of the imaginative realm in treating patients with depression is limited. The aim of this study is to identify from the dramatherapists' point of view, whether the imagination can be a useful intervention in the treatment of clients with depression. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with dramatherapists working for non-NHS organisations in England. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was used to analyse the data. The findings highlight the dramatherapists' perception of the imaginarli realm and self, the imagination in depression and how autobiographical and future memory may influence depressive symptoms. The symptoms include social isolation, social anxiety, avoidance behaviours, low self-esteem, low motivation, negative mindset, suicidal ideation and low mood. The structure of the imaginary realm is questioned and new experiences are highlighted as being significant for enabling.people with depression to build a more positive impression of the future inside and outside of therapy. The relevance of a diagnosis is also discussed in regards to its necessity and the difficulties it can cause for clients suffering from depression. In addition, there is some indication of how dramatic reality could be used to treat depression as a complimentary treatment to medicines in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Joinau, Benjamin								The Arrow and the Sun: A Topo-mythanalysis of Pyongyang								SUNGKYUN JOURNAL OF EAST ASIAN STUDIES				14	1			65	92					APR 2014	2014	As the capital of the DPRK, Pyongyang fascinates with its socialist architecture and planned urbanism where propaganda and ideology are set as a mise en scene landscape. I propose a reading of this city from a symbolic point of view, trying to find behind the actual topography the ideological myth written by the regime since 1945. This concrete-and-marble-made narrative was built gradually. After a diachronic description of key sites, I locate topologic and symbolic structures that enable a "topo-mythanalysis," or analysis of the imaginary ("imaginaire" in French) providing the framework for the (re)construction of Pyongyang. We find a historical axis which rotates slowly during the 1970s and 80s around a center corresponding to Mansu Hill and its Grand Monument, becoming eventually a new "axis of destiny," or arrow, to the glory of Kim Il Sung's personal myth. The "ideological polygon" found in the center of the city works as a rotating sun in an exclusively diurnal imaginary.									0	0	0	0	0	1598-2661		WOS:000335124500004		
J	Yamaguchi, Tomiko								Social imaginary and dilemmas of policy practice: The food safety arena in Japan								FOOD POLICY				45				167	173		10.1016/j.foodpol.2013.06.014			APR 2014	2014	Through the string of food safety scares that has rocked Japanese society since the early 2000s, conflicts between the traditional notion of socially acceptable risk and the idea of a science-based risk analysis approach have surfaced in the food safety arena. Elites, including government officials and those members of scientific communities who support the science-based risk analysis approach, have become responsible for communicating seemingly contradictory ideas such as "food in Japan is safe" and "there is no such thing as zero risk with food." This communication logjam has resulted in confusion and created public distrust of both government and scientific experts. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to examine the struggles and challenges faced by government officials in explaining and practicing policies that pertain to highly controversial food safety issues. The primary data used for illuminating the discourses is the official minutes of governmental committees including the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Committee and the Consumer Commission.

J	Dudek, Maciej K.								Living in an imaginary world that looks real								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL				41				209	223		10.1016/j.jedc.2014.01.021			APR 2014	2014	In the paper we show - using standard approaches, general equilibrium modeling and the assumption of complete rationality - that the macroeconomic environment is endogenous and is indeterminate. Specifically, it is argued - without resorting to sunspot type arguments - that microeconomic fundamentals do not suffice to characterize the economy at the macro level. In particular, we show how perceptions of rational agents of the workings of the economy (a) shape the environment, (b) affect the environment sufficiently to ensure that rational economic agents find the observed environment consistent with their beliefs even though it is not. As a by-product, we illustrate that endogenous macro uncertainty can arise as an outcome if rational economic agents whose expectations are anchored on endogenous variables expect them to arise. Finally, we show that systematic errors can persist indefinitely under rationality. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									0	0	0	0	0	0165-1889		WOS:000335876500012		
J	Strubbe, Glenn; Vanheule, Stijn								THE SUBJECT IN AN UPROAR: A LACANIAN PERSPECTIVE ON PANIC DISORDER								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PSYCHOANALYTIC ASSOCIATION				62	2			237	266		10.1177/0003065114527616			APR 2014	2014	From Jacques Lacan's theory of anxiety, principles are deduced for a Lacanian-oriented treatment of panic disorder. This Lacanian approach is related to Freud's theory of the actual neuroses, and is comparable in some ways with the approach taken in Panic-Focused Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (PFPP). The Lacanian conceptualization of panic retains the idea that both repressed material and unsymbolized mental states lie at its basis. People suffering from panic attacks are overwhelmed by signifiers, aspects of corporeal excitation, and/or existential questions that remain too Real. Psychoanalytic therapy aims to create a name for such Real elements. The three registers that Lacan situates at the basis of his psychoanalytic approach (the Symbolic, the Imaginary, and the Real) are discussed, as well as the treatment principles for conducting this clinical work. The case study of a young woman with panic disorder is presented to illustrate how a brief, Lacanian-oriented treatment (forty-eight sessions) progressed, and where the patient managed to both name and find a symbolic place for psychic experiences that were too Real. During this treatment, the patient overcame her avoidant-defensive mode of functioning and her persistent difficulties related to separation.									0	0	0	0	0	0003-0651		WOS:000334425400002	24651266	
J	Peacock, Marian; Bissell, Paul; Owen, Jenny								Shaming Encounters: Reflections on Contemporary Understandings of Social Inequality and Health								SOCIOLOGY-THE JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH SOCIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION				48	2			387	402		10.1177/0038038513490353			APR 2014	2014	The idea that social inequality has deleterious consequences for population health is well established within social epidemiology and medical sociology (Marmot and Wilkinson, 2001; Scambler, 2012). In this article, we critically examine arguments advanced by Wilkinson and Pickett in The Spirit Level (2009) that in more unequal countries population health suffers, in part, because of the stress and anxiety arising from individuals making invidious or shame-inducing comparisons with others regarding their social position. We seek to extend their arguments, drawing on sociologically informed studies exploring how people reflect on issues of social comparison and shame, how they resist shame, and the resources, such as collective imaginaries' (Bouchard, 2009), which may be deployed to protect against these invidious comparisons. We build on the arguments outlined in The Spirit Level, positing a sociologically informed account of shame connected to contemporary understandings of class and neoliberalism, as well as inequality.									1	0	0	0	1	0038-0385		WOS:000333768300012		
J	Unverzagt, Krystin; Mayer, Maximilian								The Elephant Observing the Dragon: Sociotechnical Imaginaries of Satellite Technology and the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma								KOREAN JOURNAL OF DEFENSE ANALYSIS				26	2			193	208					SUM 2014	2014	Based on the assumption that Indian foreign policy-making is characterized by an inherent military restraint and funding for technologies is focused on civilian issues, it is not surprising that the application of Indian satellite technologies has so far been dedicated to societal development and the public good. Against this background, it is puzzling that the Indian Space Research Organisation has recently launched a communications satellite designed to provide services to the Indian Navy. Indeed, the installation of India's first dedicated military satellite in orbit represents a shift not only in India's perception of the use of its satellite capacities but in its security policy in general and maritime doctrine in particular. The following article combines the notion of "sociotechnical imaginaries" and the idea of the "security dilemma" in order to explain this shift in India's use of satellites. Pointing out the salience of realistic theorizing in International Relations, this paper argues that a full understanding of this repurposing of hitherto civilian technologies requires a conceptual blending of IR with science and technology studies.									0	0	0	0	0	1016-3271		WOS:000341649500004
