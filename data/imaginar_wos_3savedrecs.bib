Abstract = {{This research explores the role of phonotactic probability in
   two-year-olds' production of coda consonants. Twenty-nine children were
   asked to repeat CVC non-words that were used as labels for pictures of
   imaginary animals. The CVC non-words were controlled for their
   phonotactic probabilities, neighbourhood densities, word-likelihood
   ratings, and contained the identical coda across low and high
   phonotactic probability pairs. This allowed for comparisons of
   children's productions of the same coda consonant in low and high
   phonotactic probability environments. Children were significantly more
   likely to produce the same coda in high phonotactic probability
   non-words than in low phonotactic probability non-words. These results
   are consistent with the hypothesis that phonotactic probability is a
   predictor of coda production in English. Moreover, this finding
   provides further evidence for the role of the input and distribution of
   sound patterns in the ambient language as a basis for phonological
   acquisition.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although panic disorder (PD) is suggestive of autonomic
   nervous system dysfunction, especially in the cardiovascular autonomic
   system (CAS), the results in many previous studies are still
   controversial. Using a new physiological index which could well reflect
   emotional reaction to visual stimuli (Yoshizawa, M., Sugita, N.,
   Tanaka, A., Abe, K., Yambe, T., Nitta, S., 2001. Quantiatative
   Physioligical Evaluation of Three Dimensional Images. The Seventh
   International Conference on Virtual Systems and Multumedia, 25-27.), we
   studied momentary changes in the CAS in patients with PD during
   audiovisual stimulation (AS) as mental loading. Methods: During AS,
   exposed to a video of imaginary experiences such as driving a motor
   vehicle or diving into the sea, blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR)
   were measured in 12 remitted patients with PD and 19 age- and
   sex-matched normal controls (NC). We used the maximum cross-correlation
   coefficient (rho(max)) from the BP to the HR, whose frequency
   components were limited to around 0.1 Hz. Results: The p(max) was an
   available index which could detect the momentary changes in the CAS
   during AS in both groups. The two-way ANOVA disclosed significant group
   and time effects on the rho(max). The momentary response to emotional
   stimuli in the PD patients was slower than that in the NC subjects.
   Limitations: Antidepressants have a potential impact on the autonomic
   variables in this study. Conclusions: These findings suggest that there
   may be a dysfunction of the CAS in remitted PD patients and that the
   dysfunction may be one of the trait markers of PD. To confirm these
   findings, however, further studies with a large sample size are
   required. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Using children's naive theory of biology as a framework, this study
   investigated children's developing understanding of illness by
   examining their generalisation of illness to biological and

   age, the children's health status was investigated for any possible
   links with their understanding. Healthy and chronically-ill children,
   aged 4-11 years, were randomly assigned to one of three conditions,
   according to which exemplar (child, dog or duck) was described as
   suffering from an imaginary illness. Using a card-sorting technique,
   the children assessed whether each entity out of 30 entities (five
   representatives in each of six categories: humans, mammals,
   non-mammals, birds, plants and artifacts) could be afflicted by that
   illness. The children's generalisations indicated a grasp of the
   distinctiveness of the various categories, although they seemed less
   certain about the biological status of plants. Furthermore, the type of
   exemplar on which the children had been taught influenced their
   responses. However, the children's reasoning appeared unaffected by
   their health status and largely unaffected by age or gender. Copyright

Abstract = {{In this paper I discuss Fleur Jaeggy's writings from her early

   fluid subjectivity, Jaeggy creates imaginary existences in which time
   is fragmented in non-continuous segments, and personal identity is
   represented in the process of being molded and dissolved. Yet, the
   author fails to defy the notion of identity and its world of
   certainties and stability, for her characters, whose all-pervading
   selves take over the narration, suspend time in the actual moment of
   their storytelling, and their becoming is in fact a being once and for
   all. Jaeggy does not write and does not like to speak about herself,
   and her narrative is only vaguely autobiographical; however, by
   questioning the concept of identity, she voices the individual's
   resistance to any binding definition of his/her psychological
   complexity and freedom.}},

Volume = {{149}},

Pages = {{161-198}},
Abstract = {{We attempt to show the unique nature of Grice's Cooperation Principle
   within the analytic discourse. The analytic alliance is the
   transference of Grice's maxims to the Other: Due to the split of the
   ego, the imaginary conscious speech has to violate the maxims for them
   to return in inverted form as the discourse of the Other (unconscious),
   and hence attain to the maxims. For each of Grice's categories
   (quantity, quality, relation, and manner), we check this hypothesis
   against examples from Freud and Lacan.
   Psychoanalysis centers on discourse. This discourse is not only a means
   for therapy. By his speech, the analysand recognizes his unconscious,
   that speech-making existence from absence (lack) is in itself a symptom
   undergoing the `talking cure'.
   The analytic discourse is characterized as a therapeutic pact between
   analysand and analyst: The analysand loses himself in words and says
   whatever comes to mind with no censorship or judgment, subjecting
   himself to the Other. The analyst meeting the analysand's `free
   associations' with `evenly suspended attention' situates himself in the
   locus of that Other reflecting the discourse of the Other. By its
   nature, this pact cultivates transference. Transference is a speech
   act, so such discourse is not a hermeneutic interpretation but a
   working-through of the speaker's identity (who he is: age, role, and
   whom is he calling).}},

Abstract = {{Since the early 1990s, there has been a steady increase in the use of

Abstract = {{Between the end of the American Occupation in Haiti (1934) and the
   beginning of the Duvalier regime in the 1960s, Haitian literature is
   posited around three codes of positive reference: indigenism, magical
   realism, and marxism. The obscurantism and totalitarianism of the
   Duvalier dictatorship (1957-1986) with its spiral of underdevelopment
   and its destructive and destructuring tendencies, left a mark on both
   the environment and the imaginary. The symbolism of Ruin becomes a
   powerful presence in literature, and the result is a break with the
   descriptive system of magical realism and the emergence of a new
   aesthetic: the Aesthetics of Decay, highly visible in the title of
   works. This can be observed notably through the theme of zombification,
   the treatment of space (particularly urban space), and the replacement
   of the Promethean hero by collective heroes, heroines or anti-heroes.
   It is a new literature based on a new system of aesthetics, but also
   one which aims to denounce social ills in the strongest possible terms

   Being confronted until the 1980s with the novel's imaginary in Quebec
   (marked by the topics of loss, the absent country and historical
   depossession), the question of the identity in the Haitian novel enters
   into an intercultural, tense relationship with the dominant literary

   owing to a feeling of split identity (G. Etienne, A. Phelps, E.
   Ollivier, J. Jonassaint). Since the 1990s, in accordance with the
   increasing heterogeneousness of Quebec culture, the novels of the
   Haitian diaspora have aimed at overcoming the gaps of identity and
   establish a more dialogic ('migrant') relationship with the Caribbean
   cultural space by cultivating narrative intimacy, by elaborating on the
   fictional self and on `drifting memory'. (D. Laferriere, J. Des

   making reference to some of Bhabha's central arguments, this reading of
   Chamoiseau's narration of a Martinican identity which resists the
   domination of the institutionalized narrations albeit without rejecting

Abstract = {{This paper begins to explore the changing political geographies of
   alternative development as practiced and envisioned in the global
   South. Looking specifically at the growing movement and market for fair
   trade foods, this form of alternative development has become the moral
   business of latte drinkers and other reflexive consumers in Europe and
   the US. Fair trade attempts to reconnect producers and consumers
   economically, politically, and psychologically through the creation of
   a transnational moral economy. This re-connection is accomplished
   through material and semiotic commoditization processes that produce
   fair trade commodities. The semiotic production of these commodities
   and their traffic in particular `political ecological imaginaries' is
   essential to the formation of ethical production-consumption links,
   acting to also politicize consumption and fair trade eaters. Fair
   trade's moral economy rides the tension between the ethical
   relationships it fosters and the need for the wily characteristics of
   enterprise in the construction of transnational trade networks.
   Bringing recent work on moral geography to bear, constructing this
   moral economy is an attempt to facilitate a sense of `solidarity in
   difference' in the experiences of global economic inequalities between
   North and South and growers and eaters. At the same time, fair trade
   networks look to produce an expansive `spatial dynamics of concern' in
   the fashioning of ethical places of production and consumption. The
   paper concludes with a brief discussion of the continuing dilemmas
   critical for fair trade and suggestions for further empirical study of
   fair trade provisioning and alternative development networks. (C) 2004

   how his theory of essay composition lends itself to a radical
   democratic imaginary that complicates the account of political argument
   Habermas sets out. Hazlitt's essays, the author concludes, are

Abstract = {{The sociological approach to social imagination is concerned with both
   a theoretical revival and with specific applications (political
   mythology, everyday rumour, the image of the other, etc.). It is lodged
   in the traditions of the humanities, especially in the works of the
   founders of this approach, who accorded special attention to collective
   representations, rites, and symbolic systems. The authors of the
   article show how the problem of the imagination is situated at the
   point where the issues of the social converge and that it enables a
   unique perception of micro-social aspects and serious trends in human
   history. An examination is therefore made of the methodological and
   epistemological aspects that render the imaginary a constructible
   object for sociology.}},

Abstract = {{The image of the water sprite and rusalka, so present in German and
   Russian art in the nineteenth century, is inherited from the tradition
   of beliefs in the existence of these mysterious water creatures. In
   Germany the water sprite appeared on the stage in 1792 (Das
   Donauweibchen); it was transformed into a Singspiel in 1792, and
   entered the world of literature thanks to La Motte-Fouque (1811), and
   then was turned into an opera heroine by E.T.A. Hoffmann (1816) and by
   Lortzing (1845). In Russia the German Singspiel adapted by Krasnopolski
   (1803)led to the creation of the The Dnepr rusalka, who kept the traits
   of the Germanic water sprite. Pushkin drew his inspiration from her to
   write his drama Rusalka (1832), realising a literary codification of
   this character from folk tales, which was later adapted into an opera
   by Dragomizhsky. Some traits are common to all these Germanic and
   Russian works and characters, yet, only Dvorak's Rusalka has survived,
   for it is a wonderful synthesis of all the characteristics of these
   imaginary beings into a unique character.}},

Volume = {{70}},

Abstract = {{Current local-scale changes in the landscape interweave with larger
   forces of globalization, time-space compression and media proliferation
   altering the face of landscape, both rural and urban, around the world.
   These larger forces span all sectors of human activity and inform a new
   cultural economy of space, creating new landscape spatialities that
   require a reformulation of landscape definitions, as well as new
   conceptual models and methodological approaches. This paper aims to
   contribute towards this objective by investigating such ongoing change
   and proposing new conceptual tools for the articulation, analysis and
   planning of the contemporary landscape at new geographical scales.
   Perhaps the most significant variable in these new landscape
   spatialities is geographical connectivity. Landscape may no longer be
   viewed as a segment of the geographical world-real, perceived or
   imaginary-but rather as a situated image or system at the interface of
   different scales of contact with an ``observer{''}. In specific,
   landscapes today appear no longer spatially enclosed, restricted and
   tied to locality. Both in terms of function and of symbolism, they are
   increasingly characterized by processes, forms and signs with external,
   rather than internal, references. Empirical examples are drawn from the
   rural landscape of Greece. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the role of visual cultures in understanding the

   paper also considers these visual cultures as prismatic devices which
   refract lived landscapes of South Asia and East Africa into British

   connections to landscapes experienced pre-migration, including sensory
   connections with past homes, natures and family life. These then become
   artefacts symbolising relationships with past landscapes, made
   meaningful in their presence in Britain homes. Using this materialist
   lens, visual cultures in the British Asian home, such as photographs,
   pictures, and paintings, are given meaning and value beyond their
   textual content. This paper is an exercise in reading visual cultures
   in the everyday through a materialist lens which allows for an

   Asian women in Britain. In particular, objects presence the migratory
   experience of the South Asian community, importing `other' landscapes

Abstract = {{The field of education is faced with various new challenges in meeting
   with the demands of teaching and learning for the 21st century. One of
   the new challenges is the call for the integration of ICT ( Information

   alternative mode of instruction delivery. Multimedia technology for
   instance, has the potential in transforming traditional classrooms into
   a world of unlimited imaginary environment. This paper reports on a
   research project on development of an interactive multimedia courseware
   package for moral values education using traditional Malay oral
   narratives called CITRA. CITRA uses CD-ROM and the computer as a means
   of dissemination. It is a didactic tool created for the teaching and
   learning of good moral values in an interactive multimedia environment.
   It is made up of four learning modules: Storytelling World module,
   Enjoyable Reading World module, Word Enrichment Corner module, and Mind
   Test Land module. The tool's most important feature is its user
   interaction capability. The principle objective of this project is to
   create a pedagogical tool that combines on-screen text, graphics,
   animation, audio and video in an enticing environment and thus enables
   the positive values and images of stories to be projected.}},

Abstract = {{This essay serves as countermemory as it reclaims the historical role
   of two late Latin singers, Guadalupe Victoria Yoli Raimond, known as
   ``La Lupe,{''} and Hector ``Lavoe{''} Perez, in the development of
   Latin music in the United States and in the construction of a Puerto
   Rican national identity, in the case of Lavoe, and of a Caribbean
   Latino community in the Diaspora, with respect to La Lupe. Most
   recently, younger generations of salsa singers such as Yolanda Duke, La
   India, Marc Anthony, and Van Lester, have ``mimetically embodied{''} La
   Lupe and Lavoe, respectively, by recreating their singing styles, their
   repertoires, and their personae. Why are Puerto Ricans and Caribbean
   Latinos/as memorializing these two particular singers? While also
   shaped by gender politics, Lavoe and La Lupe's countercultural
   positionings articulate the complex process of forming oppositional
   identities whereby their personal lives and stage personae remit
   audiences, in metonymic ways, to the constructed illegality of being a
   Latino in the United States. Their respective social marginalities
   contribute to their canonization as musical and countercultural heroes
   while simultaneously triggering posthumous performances of
   countermemory While Lavoe has been canonized and integrated into the
   masculine genealogy of Puerto Rican national musical forms, La Lupe's
   struggles with the industry revealed her structured secondariness as a
   female interpreter and artist in a male-dominated world. Transcending
   the mere reflexivity of music and identity, we also argue that the act
   and process of memorializing both La Lupe and Lavoe are re-creations
   and reconstructions of the Puerto Rican/Latino/a imaginary by
   incorporating the diasporic narrative into the traditional inscriptions

Abstract = {{There are problems in applying the methodology of the natural sciences

   time it suggests a reinterpretation of older psychological research.
   First-order experiments study psychological phenomena, but second-order
   experiments, now very common, study how people describe imaginary
   situations, and their reactions to them, so that it is essentially a
   study of discursive practices. Wittgenstein's use of the word `grammar'
   suggests a convenient term for clusters of working rules. Philosophers
   have identified similar clusters of propositions, as a priori but
   synthetic propositions, expressing principles of order imposed on raw
   material by human beings. Psychologists have identified contingent
   universals which have such an ordering function. The revelation of the

   communalism dead? Reflections on the present and future practice of
   crime prevention. It aims to foster further debate on ``the
   communal{''} in the field of crime prevention specifically, and in
   criminology more generally. In the first part of the article, an
   argument is made for a progressive discourse on communities built
   around the theory and practice of radical communitarianism. In the
   second part of the article, a debate is opened up on the continuing
   salience of appeals to communities in the contemporary governance of
   crime, disorder and safety. In particular, two questions-or
   provocations-are briefly explored in terms of ``the instabilities of
   community governance{''} and what we may term the problem of ``the
   stranger in community safety{''}. Finally, the article argues for the
   rethinking of the relationship of the communal and the critical
   criminological imaginary.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a long tradition of writing on collective representations of
   the past, anthropology has contributed relatively little to the
   expanding literature on national memory. Yet ethnographic approaches
   have the facility to delineate practices that create historical
   narrative and give it emotive power while keeping in view longer-term
   political forces that underwrite dominant imaginaries. In this article
   I inquire into the discursive origins of emotional involvement in
   national history by juxtaposing two events of spectacular violence,
   September 11 and Pearl Harbor. Focusing on the representation of these
   events in public culture and at memorial sites, I argue that personal
   narratives play a central role in formations of national subjectivity,
   at times emotionalizing dominant memories and at other times opening
   possibilities for alternative visions.}},

Journal = {{GEOFORUM}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{593-606}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper adopts the concept of `environmental imaginaries' to explore
   the influence of environmental discourses upon supporters of Australian
   environmental movements. Rather than investigate knowledge, values,
   attitudes or behaviour, as is often the focus of research into public
   environmentalism, this study analyses the presence, absence, influence
   and interactions of different environmental discourses at the
   interpersonal scale. The relative acceptability and familiarity of
   different environmental philosophies, with their radically different
   approaches to nature, has important impacts upon the political
   strategies, actions and directions adopted by environmental movements.
   Through conducting a series of ongoing discussion groups with
   self-identifying `environmentalists' it is found that nature is
   constructed predominantly through the language and concepts of
   sustainable development, although this discourse coexists with a number
   of concurrent and oppositional viewpoints. The power of sustainable
   development is self-sustained through the normalisation of particular
   languages and modes of expression. Alternative ideas and discourses are
   inhibited by a lack of language and familiarity and consequently
   disempowered and relegated to subordinate positions within discussions.
   The paper concludes by arguing that the lack of acceptance of
   alternative ecocentric ideas within the environmental community risks
   deradicalising the movement and limits the diversity of political
   strategies and options that it could potentially adopt. (C) 2004

Month = {{SUM}},
Abstract = {{Between the end of the American Occupation in Haiti (1934) and the
   beginning of the Duvalier regime in the 1960s, Haitian literature is
   posited around three codes of positive reference: indigenism, magical
   realism, and Marxism. The obscurantism and totalitarianism of the
   Duvalier dictatorship (1957-86) with its spiral of underdevelopment and
   its destructive and destructuring tendencies, left a mark on both the
   environment and the imaginary. The symbolism of Ruin becomes a powerful
   presence in literature, and the result is a break with the descriptive
   system of magical realism and the emergence of a new aesthetic: the
   Aesthetics of Decay, highly visible in the title of works. This can be
   observed notably through the theme of zombification, the treatment of
   space (particularly urban space), and the replacement of Promethean
   hero by collective heroes, heroines or anti-heroes. It is a new
   literature based on a new system of aesthetics, but also one that aims
   to denounce social ills in the strongest possible terms and places a
   quasi-mystical value on change.}},

Abstract = {{The movements for cultural and political emancipation that led to the

   Haitian writer Jean Metellus, the process of mythification of
   historical heroism, the crystallization of the founding figure of
   Jean-Jacques Dessalines as a catalyst of new existential, historic, and
   symbolic legitimacies. The strategies of marginalization set in place

   divided 18 males into three groups: a physical practice (PP) group; a

   stimulus proposition mental practice (SP) group. Each participant
   either physically or mentally practiced 40 contractions twice a week

Pages = {{95-113}},
Abstract = {{This essay discusses an unpublished series of self-representational
   photographs made by Francesca Woodman in the late 1970s which she
   collected together to form an artists book. Given the title Portrait of
   a Reputation, over the series of five photographs Woodman performs a
   photographic striptease, creating a narrative of disappearance as the
   artist gradually slips from view. Finally leaving only a trace of her
   presence as an indexical hand-print on her studio wall, Woodman's
   series can be read as an analogy of photography itself, as the artists
   uses her own body to act out stages of the mediums process. Looking at
   the way in which the serial format and the album structure work to
   animate this process in the imaginary moment of spectatorial encounter,
   I argue that Woodman's retroactive performance hinges on her use of the
   prop of the glove which both conceals and reveals her body. A prop
   which recurs throughout Woodman's photographic practice, the glove is
   here imagined as a narrative prop or lure, drawing attention away from
   the photographic sleight of hand the artist performs, as the subject
   under the cameras objectifying gaze is ultimately absented.}},

Abstract = {{In fantasy role-playing games, participants collectively create and

   of rules that function as guidelines for make-believe action and

   role-players actively negotiate these symbolic boundaries: how
   role-players carve out distinct spheres of meaning between themselves,
   their fantasy personas, and status as players of these games. It also
   illustrates how these distinctions fail. Boundaries erupt and
   role-players prove unable to compartmentalize themselves so discretely.
   Through the lens of these games, we can examine simplified and
   exaggerated dynamics and entertain the possibility that we are all

   ourselves to be and the personas we perform in situated social

Abstract = {{Based on the Venetian chronicle Diarii written between 1496 and 1533 by
   Marin Sanudo, this research work aims at seizing the importance of the
   symbolic figure of the monster in those crucial decades when the Middle
   Ages was fading away and the Modern Age was beginning. On the other
   hand, the many testimonies supplied by the chronicler allow us to look
   at the paroxysmal figure of the monster from the point of view of its
   typological descriptions, but on the other hand the chronicler reveals
   the many particularities which are peculiarly associated with this
   monster figure. These particularities tend to represent the monster as
   an entirely different natural entity. Put into an historical context
   particularly sensitive and receptive towards eschatological signs and
   towards distressing expressions of religious ardour, the figure of the
   monster stimulates our desire of comprehension and of knowledge. The
   monster hits the sensibility of the believers and the unanswered
   fearful questions elicited by its enduring presence seem to obsess the
   collective imaginary. Differently from the strange but marvellous
   Oriental creatures that strongly fascinated the West, the monster
   depicted in Marin Sanudo's Diarii looks in the excess or absence of its
   physical limbs more a deformed human being than an unnatural creature.
   Nevertheless, the monster is a sign and symbol of a different language,
   perceived by the believers with mixed feelings of curiosity and
   repulsion. Certainly, it is a sign that needs interpreting within the
   boundaries of the divine scheme. From this point of view, the monster
   is the visible and warning metaphor of God's anger at men, a God ready
   to punish a sinful humanity. But the monster also becomes a political
   tool in the hand of the authorities, it becomes an effective tool of
   propaganda. With its polyphony of significations, of functions and of
   shapes, the monster reveals itself and needs to be revealed, because in
   spite of its difference and variety its appearance and presence is
   always the carrier of meaning.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To investigate how houseplant `caretakers `represent the

   Methods The present study was carried out among caretakers from three S
   (a) over tildeo Paulo State municipalities in which dengue is known to
   exist and in which extensive educational activities had been previously
   conducted Twenty households from each of the municipalities studied
   were selected based on larval density evaluation bulletins elaborated
   by SUCEN (Endemic Disease Control Coordination) and classified as
   positive or negative for the presence of Aedes aegypti larvae in plant
   vases. The 60 participants were aged 20-65 years and were directly
   involved in plant care. Interviews were carried out using a
   semi-structured questionnaire, and recorded in cassette tapes. Data
   were tabulated using the collective subject discourse technique.
   Results Negative representations found included: erroneous information
   in the population imaginary universe; disbelief that a `tiny little
   mosquito' could cause such extensive problems; belief in the disease
   only after its concrete manifestation; and mistrust in educational
   activities in general. Positive representations included: understanding
   of the basic mechanism of dengue transmission; appreciation of the role
   and constant presence of sanitary authorities; understanding of their
   own share of responsibility in fighting the disease.
   Conclusions With respect to vector control activities, the exceedingly
   synthetic messages emitted by the sanitary authorities prevent the
   information from being assimilated by the population to the desirable
   extent. Educational activities must be understood by the population to
   which they are destined if any behavioral changes are to take place.}},

Abstract = {{The Spanish Civil War saw an outburst of antisemitism in the

   review. All the factions of the Nationalist camp interpreted the civil
   war as a crusade against the `Jewish-Masonic-Bolshevist' conspiracy. In
   mainland Spain, where there were only a few Jewish families,
   antisemifism was largely confined to the written word. In this way, it
   was used mostly as a rhetorical tool to attack the Nationalists' real
   and imaginary enemies: the Republican forces, the French and the
   Soviets. Although there was no systemic persecution of the Jews, some
   aggressive acts took place in Seville and Barcelona. The situation of
   the larger Jewish community in Spanish Morocco was quite different. The
   Moroccan Jews were adversely affected by the Nationalists' efforts to
   enlist the support of the Muslim population against the Republicans and
   by the German presence in the protectorate. They were also victimized
   by the Falangists who confiscated their property and imposed heavy
   fines on them. The military authorities of Morocco tried to restrain
   these excesses as they realized that blatant antisemitism could hurt
   the rebels' image abroad. They also believed that Jewish wealth and

   Entering into the homes of three groups of women migrants living and
   working in Batam, the relationship between the private realm that they
   inhabit and the social contexts in which they participate publicly is
   investigated. Some of the choices that women make at and about home are
   identified, and their ability to ``micro-resist{''} these external
   structures is explored. At home, the dynamic relationship between the
   Batam development project and the women's own hopes and visions of the
   place-sometimes parallel and sometimes incongruous-are revealed. As
   they experience life on Batam, their ``social imaginaries{''} of it are
   shaped into various new realities, and their homes, removed from the
   confines of the factory floor, thus become spaces of release from these
   tensions.}},

Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{493-528}},
Abstract = {{In the lyrical work of the German Minnesanger Walther von der
   Vogelweide (late 12th, early 13th century), landscape functions as a
   representation, which may be inscribed in a long-standing tradition but
   is re-interpreted by the poet and given a variety of functions and
   meanings. In no way do these representations describe reality. Save in
   one poem where the poet stands before nature as he would before a
   painting, and engages in philosophical speculation as he beholds the
   scenery, his work features no instance of anything but an imaginary or
   symbolic landscape. Thus the very idea of a landscape is linked to
   either bliss or woe, as they are disclosed by lexemes, imagery,
   comparisons and metaphors, all implements of an idiolect which is at
   times playful and often revealing. Revelation should be read as an
   opposition between vertical and horizontal themes, as seen through the
   prism of the virtues extolled by the poet. Blissful times are conjured
   up, swathed in the light of ecstatic love, at times reminiscent of an
   artificial paradise, or woeful days captured in bleak tones of demise
   and death.}},

   between the different types of commemoration exemplified by the main
   characters in the work (the narrator who was born on the night of the
   sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff in the Baltic in 1945, his mother Tulla
   Pokriefke who is a familiar figure from earlier narratives by Grass,
   and his son Konny who sets up a website commemorating the historical
   figure of Gustloff in a neo-Nazi spirit). It explains the disjointed
   (crab-like) character of the narrative as a means of maintaining
   openness in relation to both past and future, and it brings out the
   sense in which this mode of narration subverts the blurring of the real
   and the imaginary which Grass shows to be an inherent danger of
   cyberspace culture. The essay thus concludes that Grass is enacting a

Abstract = {{Evoking ``two faces{''} of his ``Theatre, Secret{''}, Jean Tardieu
   meant to distinguish the right and the wrong sides of the setting, the
   poverty of the dramatic tools and the imaginary wonder of the show. As
   early as in his first sketches, written in his youth, he had tried his
   hand at the two faces of this vast theatre in turn, creating both rough
   comic sketches exhibiting and accusing the most blatantly old-fashioned
   dramatic conventions, and a magnificent poetic, plastic and musical
   alchemy. When, after the Liberation of France, he became one of the
   playwrights responsible for the creation of new dramatic forms, he took
   back the experimental attempts of his youth and presented the audience
   with both a chamber theatre defined as an ``abstract dramatic art{''}
   playing with the codes of the ritual of the theatre, and with several
   poems to be performed, ``works of a surprising genre{''}, endowing the
   ``secret gestures of poetry{''} with all the potentialities of a
   dramatic performance. From a stage technique which centres on the
   theatre mechanism to an embodied poetry which frees itself from the
   limits of a traditional performance thanks to the help of plastic and
   audiovisual arts, music or choreography, the deep unity of Jean
   Tardieu's dramatic creation lies in the unsettlement of the plot and
   the systematic experimentation with all stage combinations.}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses some effects of migration politics on asylum

   multisited ethnographic research that tracked interpretative concepts
   of the refugee experience. Following a grounded theory approach, it
   identifies imaginaries of trauma and trust as key categories in the
   field of transnational migration and health. The psychiatric concept of
   trauma and a more popularized discourse of traumatic memory are
   strongly emphasized in all of the investigated field sites: the
   providers of primary health care and psychosocial services and
   representatives of social welfare agencies and law-making bodies use
   this ``diagnosis{''} extensively. This leads refugees to develop
   tactics of a) identifying with the trauma discourse in order to become
   ``good refugees{''} and achieve legal status in Switzerland; b)
   struggling with the ascribed pathologies and suffering from
   retraumatizing effects of these predominant trauma policies; and c)
   trying to refuse or subvert them by emphasizing the existence of
   structural violence in the receiving countries. An analysis of the
   interactions of health providers and refugees shows that it takes place
   in an environment of social and economic insecurity and in a shared
   imaginary of (mis)trust, putting at stake the moral economy of recent

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on contemporary re-imaginings of the land in North

   `culture of resistance' to contemporary as well as past processes of
   dispossession. The stories are about reclaiming land through a local,
   collective imaginary. They chart cultural territory (collective rights
   to land) at the same time that they dispute geographical territory
   (private and non-local rights to land).
   The evidential base for the discussion is provided, first, by the
   actions of local history groups which have emerged over the past decade
   and, second, by the actions of the North Sutherland Community Forestry
   Trust. The latter, formed in 2000, has become a significant player in

Abstract = {{Since the 1970s, the tapping of James Bay's hydroelectric potential has
   been synonymous with the tapping of divergent national imaginaries for
   native and non-native people in Quebec. Exploitation of natural
   resources in the region has activated different narratives of political
   identity for each community. I explore this evolving political context
   by examining how, for each group, water has emerged simultaneously as a
   physical entity possessing economic value and a social artefact
   supporting the consolidation of national boundaries. I do so by
   analysing three phases of changing relationships around resource
   management, namely: hydroelectric development on the La Grande river in
   the 1970s; the Cree opposition to Great Whale in the 1990s; and the
   recent agreement concerning a new relationship between the two parties.
   in each of these phases, nature has been both the symbolic and material
   tie that binds different national identities and materialises their
   boundaries. While these are not boundaries in the traditional
   geopolitical understanding of the term, the forging of an equitable
   framework of development in the region depends on the recognition of
   nature as a historical and political formation that answers to
   different sets of national preoccupations.}},

Abstract = {{There was a change in the aesthetic perception of art in the Sixties
   and Seventies. That was the period when so called modernity reached its
   peak and when it became possible to articulate very transparently that
   many barriers between fine and commercial art had fallen. Although the
   first such theoretical perceptions had been formulated and elaborated
   much earlier (most outstandingly by Walter Benjamin and later on, among
   others, by Jean Francois Lyotard) it can be argued that before the
   mentioned period the theory of mass culture had not had a decisive
   impact on artistic production and vice versa. On entering the mass
   perception, the new forms of aesthetic praxis overturned the whole
   functioning of the arts in the social imaginary. Although discussing
   the problems of the form of aesthetic objects (products of
   technological arts included) may still be one of the noble tasks of
   aesthetic theory, there is no doubt that aesthetic production
   interferes with the reproduction of the society in a much more decisive
   way than anybody had ever dreamt before. However, the complex meaning
   of this transformation, which is inscribed in the sociological notion
   of reflexive society, is still open for exploration. Reconsidering
   relations between aesthetic and artistic praxis, and social changes
   from the viewpoint of hegemony in its intellectual and political
   significations enables deconstructive insights into modernitys
   achievements, such as, for example, Antonionis films, Warhols

Abstract = {{In recent years, scholars of ``contentious politics{''} have paid
   increasing attention to the dynamics of space and place in the

   equally important spatial constitution of the social. In this paper, I
   analyze how particular understandings of space, or what I call
   ``spatial imaginaries{''}-cognitive frameworks, both collective and
   individual, constituted through the lived experiences, perceptions, and
   conceptions of space itself-influenced the formation of the largest
   grassroots social movement in Brazilian history, the Movement of Rural
   Landless Workers (the MST). I analyze the decision to join the MST
   among small family farmers in southern Brazil and rural plantation
   workers in northeastern Brazil. People from both groups decided to join
   the movement, but the farmers from southern Brazil used their spatial
   imaginaries to embrace the act of occupying land and to create new
   frontiers for colonization while the rural workers from northeastern
   Brazil overcame the spatial imaginaries produced through the plantation
   labor system and joined the movement because they had few other options
   available to them. Because such imaginaries stay with people long after
   they engage in the initial acts of mobilization, incorporating this
   sort of analysis introduces an important dynamic component into the
   analysis of movement formation.}},

   protestations gross and unfair as they were, are not very enlightening

   is less open, more governed by rules and hierarchy that one may
   imagine, considering the ``imperialism of the genius{''} endowing
   ``leaders{''} with imaginary functions that are more gratifying than
   those of ``masters{''}: kings, emperors, ``literary officers{''}, sect
   leaders... But the masters are soon back on stage when, with the ebb of
   romanticism, the generation of the ``Parnasse{''} (Banville, Flaubert)
   insists anew on the necessity of the literary apprenticeship more than
   on the ``sacre de l'ecrivain{''} - from mysticism back to technique. In
   a literary world that is thus re-centered, the master can once again
   have a pedagogic dimension and the authority of the inimitable model,
   to the detriment of his charismatic aura.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL \& CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{75-90}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Despite its immense popularity, the Fantasy genre has been largely
   ignored by academic geography. In this paper I give an overview of the
   genre, its politics and its geographies. I examine the ways in which
   several popular Fantasy texts negotiate and draw upon `Orientalist'
   tropes. Fantasylands are often described as landscapes enabling
   characters and readers to flee the drudgery of the `real' world and
   escape into inconceivable places populated by magic and wonder, realms
   liberated from the `actualities' of everyday life. However, it is my
   contention, based on a reading of several popular Fantasy texts, that
   Fantasy cannot be viewed as a privileged genre where `you're limited
   only by your own imagination'. Fantasy is not about inventing
   Other-worlds: it is not a transcendental and surpassing genre. Rather,
   Fantasy texts, like all texts, are socially embedded. I argue that the
   construction of the `Western' characters as the `good guys' in Genre
   Fantasy texts can become problematic when these characters encounter
   `Other' Peoples. The conflation of `Western heroes' and `Good' can
   appear to confirm feelings of moral and cultural superiority when these
   `heroes' encounter `Others' in Fantasy narratives, `Otherness' becoming
   interpreted as `alien', `weird' and `fundamentally different' when
   looked at through Genre Fantasy's moral lens. Looked at in this way,
   rather than describing purely imaginary spaces, I would argue that
   these texts continue a Western historical tradition of problematically
   mapping difference on to the `Other', a mapping that serves to position
   the `Fantastic West' as morally and culturally superior to the
   `Fantastic Orient'.}},

Year = {{2003}},
Number = {{64}},
Pages = {{25-37}},
Month = {{FAL}},
Abstract = {{On September 17, 1911 a hunger revolt broke out in Ottakring, a
   proletarian suburb in northwest Vienna. But hunger and deteriorating
   living conditions were not the only causes of broad public unrest. The
   revolt was, to a greater extent, a spontaneous political articulation
   of a new social formation at the periphery of the metropolis composed
   of ``old{''} underclasses and recently arrived migrants. Both faced
   miserable conditions of work, consumption, and family life, and the
   migrants lost their dream of a better life in the city. Mentally still
   rooted in the rural environments, the ``lifeworlds{''} from which they
   had come, they experienced a fragmented urban topography driven by a
   chaotic mixture of sharp-cut urban planning and rationalization, and
   brutish Manchester-style capitalism. Instead of finding a new
   ``Heimat{''} in the city, the new immigrants suffered from
   pauperization and collective estrangement. Their location in the new
   industrial quarters of the city brought them into misery and-in the
   perception of the elite-transformed them into the dangerous, amorphous
   ``Other{''} of urban society. Their material poverty and cultural
   stigmatization allowed only a minimum of freedom and self-realization
   within the emerging formation of mass culture. Symbolic discrimination
   and economic marginality configured a specific suburban lifestyle
   modeled along the trajectories of assimilation and deviance, lethargy
   and revolt, power, impotence and emerging mass politics.
   This article has a twofold objective: first, to elaborate the
   transformation of divergent lifeworlds and their respective
   representations in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century
   modernity in Vienna; and second, to reread Carl Schorske's seminal
   contribution in order to open up and thus illuminate modernity's mostly
   marginalized ``Other,{''} which means the dirty, dark, and disorderly
   proletarian suburbs, that enclosed, like an iron ring, the inner, more
   fashionable districts of the city. This has two more implications: to
   identify as formative structures the reconstruction of the city during
   the ``Grunderzeit{''} (which meant a booming, late-coming liberal
   capitalism in the 1880s) until World War One, while in parallel
   deciphering the city as a ``social text.{''} In other words, we intend
   an analysis of the interaction between the imaginary city existing in
   the minds of its inhabitants, and the city's formative social-economic
   structures. Thus the focus is on outcast Vienna, the culture of the
   masses, their real and imaginative colonization by the center, and the
   simultaneous social and cultural exclusion of the urban pariah by the
   elite.}},

Abstract = {{The Health Belief Model (HBM; Rosenstock, 1966 ) is the most widely
   used psychological theory of health-related behaviours but its
   applicability to non-Western, especially Asian, populations has not
   been systematically studied. The main objective of the current study
   was to examine the effects of components of the HBM and dispositional
   optimism on preventive intention in two separate samples of 220 Hong
   Kong Chinese adults and 340 Hong Kong Chinese adolescents. Two HBM
   variables, benefits and barriers, were experimentally manipulated for
   an imaginary flu outbreak and a hypothetical vaccine. Optimism in the
   two samples was assessed using the Chinese revised Life Orientation
   Test ( Lai et al., 1998 ). Participants indicated their intention to
   take the hypothetical vaccine after reading information for each of the
   treatment combinations defined by the two HBM variables. The order of
   the presentation of each of the six treatment conditions was
   counterbalanced. Results of ANOVA showed that the effects of the two
   HBM variables were similar in the two groups. Higher benefits and lower
   barriers were associated with stronger behavioural intention to take
   the vaccine. The two HBM variables interacted significantly in the
   adolescent but not the adult sample. Among the adolescents, the
   difference in intention scores between low and high barriers became
   larger when the benefits of taking the vaccine increased. In addition,
   optimism had significant effect on preventive intention only among the
   adolescents. These findings suggest that age may be an important factor
   moderating the effects of HBM components as well as optimism on
   preventive intention in Hong Kong Chinese. Implications of these
   findings to future research among Chinese were discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Everyone invokes secularism in India. So the spectrum of secularism is

   discussion of this question. The insistence of Hindu nationalists on
   emphasizing that they are the majority tend to blur the difference
   between Hindu identity and Indian identity, coextensive with the
   territory of India. This concept, moreover, serves them in their
   legitimating of the democratic system insofar as the arithmetical rule
   is a first principle of this political regime. In the name of a
   secularism founded on the idea of the greater number (and also the
   supposed ideal of immemorial Hindu tolerance) India must be governed in
   accordance with demographic fact defined in religious terms. One of the
   paradoxical consequence of this ``majoritarianism{''} is the

Abstract = {{According to Doris Humphrey, ``Nothing so clearly or inevitably reveals
   the inner man {[}sic] than movement and gesture... the moment you move
   you stand revealed, for good or ill, for what you are{''} (The dance
   notebook, 1984). Tourette Syndrome, characterized by motor and vocal
   tics, elicits stigma for just this reason: the tics and movements it
   causes have revealed Touretters as something beyond the `normal.' This
   paper examines the ways Touretters are perceived and received in public
   spaces, using published illness narratives and film documentaries to
   address the question of why the reactions TS invokes are so severe. We
   will demonstrate how the stigma surrounding the disorder stems from the
   perception of Touretters as disruptive to the order and health of
   public spaces. To describe the production of stigma and the violent
   reactions to TS individuals, we draw upon theories of bodies and
   performativity from feminist studies, Catherine Waldby's work with the
   imaginary anatomy, and geographical perspectives on the social
   construction of space. The geographic studies of space are used to
   illuminate discussions of people's life experiences by showing how body
   movements associated with illness produce stigma by transgressing the
   unwritten codes that govern particular public spaces. Our intention in
   this paper is not to introduce new empirical data, but rather to
   analyze the mechanisms of stigma formation produced by the complex
   relationships between the functioning of social spaces and individuals'
   experiences of illness. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses Korean perceptions of America using Lacanian
   psychoanalysis. Throughout modern Korean history, an idealized image of
   America has played the role of Korea's ego-ideal. While the U.S. has

   a capitalist economy, it has also defined the trajectory of many
   aspects of modern Korean history since Liberation in 1945. Furthermore,
   a series of historical experiences have caused significant changes in
   America's image. Today, the U.S. appears even as the obscene superego,
   the other side of the Other. These aspects of America correspond to the
   three father figures presented by Lacan: the idealized imaginary
   father, the symbolic father, and the obscene and violent real father.
   Shifting views of America as the Other have been reflected in Korean
   films. In Spring in My Hometown and Phantom: The Submarine, the
   oppressive aspect of the American Other takes the figure of the obscene
   real father. In Joint Security Area, the split between the American

Abstract = {{During the postwar period the modern family home assumed a special
   place in the Australian imaginary. Women achieved a greater public
   presence in this context, reflected in calls to Australian housewives
   to think about how their ideal home would look. The `new look' required
   of the national home was addressed to its occupants, the Australian
   family, and was articulated through both government policy discourses
   and the popular media. Planning for and dreaming about modernity became
   key activities of homemaking. The requirements of women, in particular,
   to dream and plan for the future family produced the housewife as a
   modem figure responsible for the planning of a successful future for
   her family. The modem challenge to make home anew spoke to women's
   authority on day-to-day living, moving the efficient arrangement of the
   home and its public exposure firmly into their domain. However, this
   new, mass-mediated way of looking at domesticity created a
   contradiction in female domestic subjectivity. On the one hand, both
   state and market discourses suggested that women could sweep away the
   elements of traditional, particularly prewar, home designs that bound
   them to the home. On the other, popular magazines also placed a great
   deal of emphasis on the look of things and on looking itself, further
   inscribing women's identity within domestic space. We argue through a
   case study of the figure of the housewife in Australian home magazines
   that as a result of this contradiction during this period the identity
   of `housewife' came to offer a new, reflexive relationship between
   female selfhood and home. Via the domestication of modernity in terms
   of gender, previous divisions between the public and private were
   destabilised. We suggest that the housewife's gaze both towards the
   home and towards her `domestic self' intensified the problematic of
   feminity, putting it on the threshold of public and private space,
   offering a critical, enabling position for an ensuing feminist analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, historians have begun studying the compromises and
   semiotic slippages underlying Enlightenment thought, what writers of
   the time characterized as, among other things, monstrosities. Monsters
   failed to conform to a perceived natural order and as such became
   models for discussing everything from the limits of knowledge to
   departures from generic practices. Taking advantage of both this
   critical trope and the presence of monsters in Rameau's Hippolyte et
   Aricie (1733), the present essay describes Rameau's struggles with
   instrumental reason in his theorization of the chromatic genius. The
   composer marked the climactic moment in act 4 of the opera with what is
   surely the most striking progression in the performed version, a
   chromatic modulation that captures the characters' shock and registers
   the monster's supernatural presence. During the same period, he
   experimented theoretically with numerous descriptions of the chromatic
   progression, as both an ordinary and an extraordinary property of
   music. Working as composer and theorist, then, Rameau let chromaticism
   occupy varied epistemological positions in his work, which in turn
   allows us to observe him dealing with the limitations of his
   theoretical system and musical representation.}},

Abstract = {{An imaginary companion (IC) has been considered to be a transitory

   attracting notice. Although an IC may in certain ways aggravate the
   patient's symptoms and regression, an IC may also serve to advance the
   therapy, for example by indicating the location of the patient's
   troubles, or acting as an intermediary between the therapist and
   patient. In cases of dissociative (conversion) disorders, it is
   generally difficult for patients to verbalize their troubles, but the
   present patients gained insight into themselves by closely examining
   their ICs. Imaginary companions are not simply entities incidental to
   the disorder, and by incorporating them into the therapeutic strategy
   as a presence supporting the patient's growth, it is possible that the
   psychotherapy may proceed more smoothly.}},

Abstract = {{Ollivier's works have several characteristics that can be considered

   of the aesthetics of the Haitian novel, as manifested in the baroque
   aspect of Ollivier's works, this analysis seeks to contrast the
   representation of female characters in his oeuvre with that typifying
   the aesthetics of marvellous realism. It would appear that in
   marvellous realism the feminine contributes to the elaboration of a
   decipherable, imaginary world, one that makes sense and creates hope,
   whereas the baroque creates impenetrable `sealed urns' serving to
   express the anxiety generated by an inconstant, elusive, senseless
   world. Thus, the baroque appears in Ollivier's works as an aesthetics
   of the uncertain and of a form of questioning that deconstructs
   reassuring discourses by means of fabricating incongruous images.}},

Abstract = {{In Australia in 2001, there was a marked escalation of debates about
   nation, national identity and national borders in tandem with a
   right-wing turn in national politics. Within the cultural context of
   debate about national identity, popular theatre became an unwitting
   ally of neo-conservative forces. Within popular theatre culture, the
   neo-conservative trend is naturalized as the view of the
   Anglo-Celtic-European mainstream or core culture that also embraces and
   depoliticizes feminist debates about home and family. Elizabeth
   Coleman's 2001 play This Way Up assists in the production of an
   inward-looking turn in the national imaginary and a renewed emphasis on
   home and family. The performance dramatizes aspects of what we are to
   understand as ordinary Australian life which might be interpreted as
   that which Prime Minister John Howard defends in the name of the
   National Interest. The cultural imaginary that shapes the production of
   the popular play is that of the conservative white national imaginary.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{463-478}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Neurophysiological studies in primates and neuroimaging studies in
   humans suggest that the orbito-frontal cortex is involved in
   representing the reward value of stimuli and in the rapid learning and
   relearning of associations between visual stimuli and rewarding or
   punishing outcomes. In the present study, we tested patients with
   circumscribed surgical lesions in different regions of the frontal lobe
   on a new visual discrimination reversal test, which, in an fMRI study
   (O'Doherty, Kringelbach, Rolls, Hornak, \& Andrews, 2001), produced
   bilateral orbito-frontal cortex activation in normal subjects. In this
   task, touching one of two simultaneously presented patterns produced
   reward or loss of imaginary money delivered on a probabilistic basis to
   minimize the usefulness of verbal strategies. A number of types of
   feedback were present on the screen. the main result was that the group
   of patients with bilateral orbito-frontal cortex lesions were severely
   impaired at the reversal task, in that they accumulated less money.
   These patients often failed to switch their choice of stimulus after a
   large loss and often did switch their choice although they had just
   received a reward. The investigation showed that bilateral lesions were
   required for this deficit, since patients with unilateral
   orbito-frontal cortex (or medial prefrontal cortex) lesions were not
   impaired in the probabilistic reversal task. The task ruled out a
   simple motor disinhibition as an explanation of the deficit in the
   bilateral orbito-frontal cortex patients, in that the patients were
   required to choose one of two stimuli on each trial. A comparison group
   of patients with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex lesions was in some
   cases able to do the task, and in other cases, was impaired. Posttest
   debriefing showed that all the dorsolateral prefrontal patients who
   were impaired at the task had failed to pay attention to the crucial
   feedback provided on the screen after each trial about the amount won
   or lost on each trial. In contrast, all dorsolateral patients who paid
   attention to this crucial feedback performed normally on the reversal
   task. Further, it was confirmed that the bilateral orbito-frontal
   cortex patients had also paid attention to this crucial feedback, but
   in contrast had still performed poorly at the task. the results thus
   show that the orbital prefrontal cortex is required bilaterally for
   monitoring changes in the reward value of stimuli and using this to
   guide behavior in the task; whereas the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
   if it produces deficits in the task, does so for reasons related to
   executive functions, such as control of attention. Thus, the ability to
   determine which information is relevant when making a choice of pattern
   can be disrupted by a dorsolateral lesion on either side, whereas the
   ability to use this information to guide behavior is not disrupted by a
   unilateral lesion in either the left or the right orbito-frontal
   cortex, but is severely impaired by a bilateral lesion in this region.
   Because both abilities are important in many of the tasks and decisions
   that arise in the course of daily life, the present results are
   relevant to understanding the difficulties faced by patients after
   surgical excisions in different frontal brain regions.}},

   by Rainer Maria Rilke. As I argue, Rilke's letter to the Prague
   Germanist August Sauer--a key voice for ethnic German nationalism in
   Bohemia--reveals itself itself to be more than a mere request for the
   works, edited by Sauer, of fellow Austrian author Adalbert Stifter.
   Rather, it constitutes a signifying field in which Rilkean anxieties
   about insufficient literary-linguistic power are figured in terms of
   imperiled masculinity, `feminine' threats, and a discourse of Austria
   as abject, inner colonial space. In the gendered anatomical imaginary
   across which the letter's rhetoric unfolds, Rilke's physical body and
   body of work become `feminized' and `contaminated' by their relation to
   a heterogeneous, ethnically fluid body of the Austrian nation. To
   illustrate this process, I read the letter's metaphors and players
   (Rilke, Stifter, Sauer, Austria itself) through paradigms oedipal and
   abject, as well as against historically specific modes of figuring
   Bohemia in terms of European colonial discourse, with its somatically
   focused dread of miscegenation and hybridity.}},

   the critical tool. Valeria and Vanna, the female characters in de

   on to a sense of security that reasonableness and social propriety
   promise at the expense of one's own desire. For both, the awareness of
   such conflict emerges through the process of writing a diary. Their
   diary entries reflect a gradual realization of the distance between
   what they discover about themselves and what the outside order tells

Abstract = {{The most plausible pro-life argument claims that abortion is seriously

   containing valuable experiences and activities. Jim Stone's version
   takes the valuable thing to be a future containing conscious goods,
   which it is the foetus's biological nature to make itself have. I give
   three grounds for rejecting these arguments. First, they lead to
   unacceptable inequalities in the wrongness of killing. Second, they
   lead to counterintuitive results in a range of imaginary cases. Third,
   they ignore the role of psychological connectedness in determining the
   magnitude or seriousness of deprivation-based harms: because the foetus
   is only weakly psychologically connected to its own future, it cannot
   be seriously harmed by being deprived of that future.}},

   shall be argued that Chatwin's literary style in The Songlines and In
   Patagonia is not so much bound up with postmodern claims but with his
   view of travelling as an act of creating social coherence in a world
   divided by commercial tourism. Integrating new life-worlds into his
   writing, Chatwin exposes himself to an insoluble paradox: seizing a
   foreign culture by imaginary acts of `taking part', he can never
   acquire the authenticity and originality he wishes for. Seeking
   consistent patterns underlying his experience, Chatwin constantly
   discovers new materialities of life which resist being accommodated to
   his imaginative geography; the ideal of experiential coherence he aims
   at thus becomes more elusive with each new attempt to validate it.}},

   function fo eccentricity in his contradictory and digressive writings,
   especially On Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic in History, Past and
   Present, but also his early novel Sartor Resartus. This makes his

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{499-515}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper explores some of the ways in which the island was mapped
   into the British and Greek national imaginaries in the late nineteenth
   and early twentieth centuries. From at least the seventeenth century
   the island, like the body, served as a model for the organisation of
   knowledge. The island functioned as an ideal body politic, in which
   political and cultural boundaries were congruent and readily defensible
   from invasion. In politically and geographically fragmented states the
   island became an important topos for resolving the problematic
   relations between nation and state, and between local knowledge and
   national unity. During the nineteenth century, national cultures were
   increasingly construed as autonomous, self-sustaining island spaces set
   apart from other communities beyond. From the second half of the
   century attention was also paid to those authentic `islands' located
   within the nation-state. In this expanded topographical definition, the
   `island' came to signify an identifiably different, contained and
   stable habitat. A relationship was sustained between these distinct
   spaces within the nation-state and the island as it was represented in
   biogeographical and evolutionary writings as a site for observing
   preserved life forms and diversification. Regional studies, for
   example, celebrated the survival of an indigenous national culture in
   geographically confined pockets. Emerging disciplines, such as
   folklore, sought to protect these spaces from the onslaught of a
   cosmopolitan modernity that threatened to overwhelm them. The island in
   this sense was a space in which `native' customs might be preserved
   and, at the same time, a space in which potentially destructive,
   atavistic forces might be controlled and ultimately domesticated. It is
   here that the island emerges as an ambivalent, problematic place: at
   once a refuge and a prison, a place of innocent childhood adventure and
   of beastly aggression. Focusing on Britain and Greece as comparative
   case studies, the paper explores how this concern for internal
   `islands' fed into and was reciprocally influenced by colonial
   encounters with `exotic' island cultures. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This essay looks at some examples of ways that certain pre-existing
   imaginary forms of `selfhood' have been culturally mapped onto
   historically pivotal moments in the Internet's development. It focuses
   less on how technologies have shaped culture than on the reverse: on
   certain ways that culture has shaped society's embrace of the Internet.
   What the Internet is and will come to be, the essay suggests, is partly
   a matter of who we expect to be when we sit down to use it.
   Specifically, it looks at two key examples of ways that certain
   pre-existing imaginary forms of selfhood - ways of understanding
   oneself as a self - have been culturally mapped onto historically
   pivotal moments in the Internet's development: the initial explosion of
   the Internet in the early 1990s and its supporting ethos exemplified by
   Wired magazine, and the Open Source Movement in the late 1990s. The
   essay suggests that significant parts of the culture of computing have
   been not only individualist, but also composed of two distinct if
   intertwined strands of individualism, romantic and utilitarian, and
   that their difference has political significance. Like its ancestor,
   the 1960s counterculture, the case of the computer culture suggests
   that romantic individualism stands in a tangential relation to
   capitalist property relations (and the utilitarian `I' they imply),
   sometimes working in concert with markets and privatization, as was the
   case in the early 1990s, and sometimes working to call them into
   question, as was the case towards the end of the 1990s.}},

   Warton became a metonym for the spiritual integrity of the nurturant

   Georgian period. What is fetishised in Lytton/Warton within the women's

   explicit celebration of the oneness of women within the movement and

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper argues for the need to revisit classical sociological texts
   with a view to excavating the masculinity that inheres in these texts
   and saturates the concept of the social. Primarily through an
   examination of Durkheim and Simmel, it explores the strategies whereby
   masculine individuals could be released from corporeality and granted
   the sort of embodiment that allowed them to transcend their
   particularity and become social agents. It is argued that male
   embodiment is deeply sedimented in the sociological imaginary as the
   very condition of social action and the constituent of social agency.
   Thinking through the conceptual lenses of corporeality, embodiment and
   agency exposes some of the ways in which the analytical scaffolding of
   `the social' rests on a deeply gendered ontological foundation. While
   the sociological tradition may indeed have continued salience for
   contemporary sociologies of the body, a relatively unreflexive
   recuperation of these texts is problematic. This paper challenges those
   who seek to rehabilitate the classics in the service of an embodied
   sociology to produce a much fuller accounting of the truncated
   corporeal terrain upon which classical sociology developed, and one
   which explicitly recognizes its gender.}},

Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{Confrontation with a psychotic episodes invariably remains a particular
   and demanding task. Most often, once the effect of surprise or even the
   feeling of anxiety or uneasiness is over, the therapist is tempted to
   react by providing a unifying and reassuring response to deal with the
   expression of a psychotic episode, which takes the form of outburst or
   loss of control, and to propose a reconstructive context. Thus at the
   institutional level, this approach psychosis leads the therapist to
   respond to the fragmentation by its apparent opposite, that is to say
   by developing a structural approach based on a stable unity. However,
   although this approach seems at first sight to be called for, and
   although its capacity to contain the psychotic episode may have a
   certain pertinence it often remains superficial, and above all it does
   not take into account the psychotic response itself. In fact, from this
   viewpoint imaginary control takes over the place of symbolization. We
   have put forward the hypothesis of another form of treatment response,
   i.e. that is incomplete and partial, which takes into account the
   irreducible nature of the psychotic condition, and which considers the
   very expression of the psychosis as an attempt at symbolization. From
   the frequent perplexity that is encountered at the onset of the
   psychosis to a full comprehension of the paranoid individual, the forms
   of psychic construction in psychotic individuals are varied, mobile,
   and finally are always specific to the subject as far as their actual
   presentation is concerned. They can be considered as ``solutions{''}
   which the subject expresses according to the given moment in his
   psychosis, and may provide support for the treatment response that has
   been proposed. The attentive presence of the therapist and the
   treatment team, and an approach that is based on non-intentionality is
   essential. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-41}},
Abstract = {{Hemiplegic patients suffer from difficulties in self-awareness, either
   due to specific neurological disturbances of body image or to
   psychological problems with their I images. Both types of difficulty
   have to do with the specular image as defined by Lacan (1966a) (i.e.,
   the psychic structure that links the body with the symbolic and
   imaginary components of identity, and neutralizes the real objects
   involved in mother-child exchange). This study is devoted to analyzing
   how recent right and left brain vascular lesions affect specular image.
   Multivariate Analysis of 308 self-portraits of right and left brain
   injured stroke patients and control participants was performed. This
   revealed three dominant types of self-portrait: 1) Erect, complete, and
   clothed self-portraits were predominantly drawn by normal participants.
   2) Erect self-portraits, lacking clothes, hands, and/or mouth and eyes
   were found in all groups of participants, predominantly in patients
   with speech disorders. Lack of hands and face features are indications
   of the challenge brought to the symbolic and imaginary aspects of
   identity by any sudden handicap, whether or not caused by a brain
   lesion, while symmetry of lacks and verticality show that body image
   may retain its structuring value even in brain lesions. 3) This is not
   the case in neurological disorders of body image, since inclined
   portraits with unilateral omissions were predominantly drawn by
   patients with right brain lesions. These unilateral omissions proved
   not only to result from cognitive deficiencies, but also to reflect the
   fragmentation of specular image, and in one case, the concomitant undue
   appearance of the object.}},

   Obejas's 1996 novel Memory Mambo and Carmelita Tropicana's performance
   piece ``Milk of amnesia/Leche de amnesia{''}, first developed in 1994-I
   explore the centrality of sexuality in constructions of self,
   community, and nation. These works effectively `queer' notions of
   immigrant belonging and Cuban diasporic consciousness, particularly in
   the sense of exploring the spatial imaginary of diaspora to expose and
   question the heteropatriarchal, and hence nationalist, underpinnings of
   more dominant models of diaspora. In their work, Obejas and Tropicana
   indicate the spatial dimensions of cultural memory and the imbrication
   of diasporic politics and sexualities. Attending to differences in
   genre, each work mines a crucial interplay between diasporic and sexual
   histories. In Tropicana's performance piece she uses a parodic
   sensibility and the broad humor enabled by the stage to engage, in a
   new register, with the politics of memory and the uses of place and
   sexuality, both in relation to Cuba and to the United States. Obejas
   works through and against the conventions of the contemporary novel
   (both immigrant and lesbian coming-of-age stories, in particular) to
   undo many of the assumptions regarding memory, sexuality, and cultural
   nostalgia as they are represented in her narrative. Both Obejas and
   Tropicana assert an imbrication of histories of colonialism, migration,
   and national attachment with experiences and practices of sexuality and
   gender in ways that underscore the importance of space and place in the
   constitution of collective memories.}},

Abstract = {{This essay outlines a conceptual approach to everyday geographies of
   the nation-state. The case study analyzed is the cross-institutional
   response to human smuggling in Canada. The essay draws on qualitative
   research with government and nongovernment actors who responded to the
   arrival of four boats carrying migrants smuggled from Fujian, China to
   British Columbia in 1999. Findings regarding the everyday institutional
   contexts of work in the field of immigration prompt deconstruction of
   the conceptual boundaries that surround governance in more abstract
   epistemologies of the state. This poststructural approach to
   geographies of the nation-state pays particular attention to the role
   of identity and language in the categorization of im/migrants and
   provokes contemplation of the transnational imaginary of the
   nation-state from the standpoint of policing international borders.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of imaginary anthropological structures elaborated by
   Gilbert Durand enables us to identify a symbolic language of ideograms
   from Mont Bego (circa 2500-1800 BC). There are three main types of
   figures: figures associated with the Bull- God and with the God of
   Storms, which come under the first function ``heroic{''}; figures
   depicting harnessing and reticulates which evoke ploughed fields ands
   make reference to the feminine and maternal function known as ``mystic
   nocturne{''}; figures linked to initiation, to the relationship between
   the first and the second function, which come under the function known
   as ``synthetic nocturne{''}. These figures are located particularlyon
   the slab known as the ``witch{''}. A comparative study of the later
   symbolic figures, presented in worship practises in archaic and then
   classic Greece and in the Greek-Roman imaginary, helps us to understand
   that Mediterranean mankind portrays a coherent image of the cosmos.

   designs contrafactual modifications and alternatives. Yet, the question
   remains open as to what dreams are dreamed and which forms of education
   are realized in a particular society, and in a historical period. The
   difference between the dream and educational reality is irrevocable; it
   corresponds with the difference between the imaginary and the real.
   There is a tangible hiatus between imagination and reality, which, by
   exposing the limits of the possibilities of education to change human
   reality, and by revealing the limits to which humans can be educated,
   gives rise to ever-new compensatory dreams as well as nightmares of

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on prison as a place in which the prisoner seeks
   health and health services. Drawing on the work of Henri LeFebvre,
   Edward Casey, Jeffrey Malpas, and Michel Foucault, a spatial analysis
   examines the constitutive roles of movement, social structure, and
   power in determining the prisoner's access to health care. The research
   methodology utilizes quantitative and qualitative analysis of women
   prisoners' attempts to get treatment for their health problems. The
   narratives of these often-failed attempts construct prison as a place
   where health care access is continually thwarted by rules, custodial
   priorities, poor health care management, incompetence, and
   indifference. Analysis of spatial practices, representations of space,
   and spaces of representation demonstrate the imposition of structural
   ordering, its naturalization, and the role of narrative in questioning
   the order, thereby creating possibilities for imaginary and real places
   where the prisoners' health needs can be met. Simultaneously, this
   analysis illuminates basic ethical questions about the limitations of
   human connection and medical caring in prison settings, regardless of
   the personal motivation of the caregiver. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The visual system is known to contain hard-wired mechanisms that
   compare the values of a given stimulus attribute at adjacent positions
   in the visual field; but how are comparisons performed when the stimuli
   are not adjacent? We ask empirically how well a human observer can
   compare two stimuli that are separated in the visual field. For the
   stimulus attributes of spatial frequency, contrast, and orientation, we
   have measured discrimination thresholds as a function of the spatial
   separation of the discriminanda. The three attributes were studied in
   separate experiments, but in all cases the target stimuli were briefly
   presented Gabor patches. The Gabor patches lay on an imaginary circle,
   which was centred on the fixation point and had a radius of 5 deg of
   visual angle. Our psychophysical procedures were designed to ensure
   that the subject actively compared the two stimuli on each
   presentation, rather than referring just one stimulus to a stored
   template or criterion. For the cases of spatial frequency and contrast,
   there was no systematic effect of spatial separation up to 10 deg. We
   conclude that the subject's judgment does not depend on discontinuity
   detectors in the early visual system but on more central codes that
   represent the two stimuli individually. In the case of orientation
   discrimination, two naive subjects performed as in the cases of spatial
   frequency and contrast; but two highly trained subjects showed a
   systematic increase of threshold with spatial separation, suggesting
   that they were exploiting a distal mechanism designed to detect the
   parallelism or non-parallelism of contours.}},

Abstract = {{Directions, Volume 18 Number 1 {[}1]suggests that postmodern theory is
   beginning to have a significant effect upon educational practice.
   Atkinson {[}2]has directed attention towards the effects of both the
   construction of the subject and the real within art teaching. Much
   postmodern theory challenges the unitary, pre-existing subject. This
   paper will argue that the persistence of an ideology of self-expression
   which asserts that all representation is in connection with (should be
   read in relation to) a singular, pure, pre-existing self acts to limit
   our understandings of the complexity of children's representations and
   is in conflict with many contemporary positions. Research has centered
   on the development of `out of school' sketchbooks. Large sketchbooks
   were given out to nursery and reception children paired with older
   siblings in primary education. Possible drawing activities and
   interests were discussed and children were left to develop the
   sketchbooks at home. Two weeks later (including a half term holiday)the
   children were interviewed in relation to the drawings developed. The
   drawings have been considered in relation to contemporary approaches to
   self and identity. The conclusions of this paper revolve around the
   possibilities of reading children's drawing relation to self and
   identity through the interaction of social context, discursive practice
   and agency in a manner which is suggested by Ricouer's formulation of
   the social imaginary. Additionally, the substitution of tenacious
   notions of expression with concepts of agency and contingency grounded
   in the characteristics of `citationality', articulation and narrative
   are suggested as a basis for developing the educational potential of
   drawing.}},

Abstract = {{The following imaginary interview is linked to an hour long drawing
   workshop carried out during the 2000 NSEAD Annual Conference
   `Creativity in Art \& Design Education'. The intention was to get
   closer to the experience by raising questions. I hope those who
   participated may recognize it as, in some way, connected to their
   experience. The American artist, Robert Motherwell maintained an
   interest in psychic automatism throughout his life. Although he
   remained suspicious of its mystical connotations{[}1]fundamental
   principles appeared to inform his working methods. Motherwell
   identified a number of key issues which serve to define its potential
   in the origination and development of paintings and drawings. He saw
   the process as ``...very little a question of the unconscious, but much
   more a plastic weapon with which to invent new forms.{''}{[}2]
   Motherwell's analysis and, to some extent defense, of the process is as
   follows:
   1. It cuts through any a priori influences, it is not a style 2. It is
   entirely personal 3. It is, by definition, original 4. It can be
   modified stylistically and in subject matter at any point during the
   process. The proposed drawing workshop seeks to explore Motherwell's
   approach and by definition, exposes a related and learning and teaching
   strategy. The process serves as a catalyst for creative thinking,
   exploiting analogy, simile and metaphor in the generation of artistic
   and personally defined contexts or narratives.}},

Abstract = {{This study of the articulation of heteropatriarchy and male

   paradigm that male same-sex desire in modernity is both ontologically
   and ritually divorced fro m ancient Greek practices. Drawing on
   Herzfeld's (1982) ethnographic model of the dual construction of modern
   Greek identity as ``Romeic{''} (qua actual, vernacular, rural-rooted,
   and ``oriental{''}), and ``Hellenic{''} (qua constructed, idealized,
   cosmopolitan, and occidental), the study explores the similarly dual
   sociosexual construction of male homosexuality following the creation
   of the modern Greek state in 1830. The study concludes that the Greek
   national project required desexing the ancient Greek past in the
   process of crafting a sanitized, heteronormative, and patriarchal
   polity in line with its Victorian-era counterparts in Western Europe.
   Furthermore, modernity reordered the extensive diasporic Greek
   communities in the Europe, the Middle East, and the Black Sea region in
   ways that promoted the fertilization of metropolitan Greece with a
   variety of rural and immigrant sexual imaginaries.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{65-79}},
Abstract = {{The article argues that the emergence of ``transnational culture{''}
   presents a major challenge to contemporary literary studies. It starts
   with an overview of recent globalisation theories that have focussed on
   ``transnational{''} issues in disciplines such as political science,
   sociology, anthropology and media studies and then moves on to discuss
   recent theories of transnational culture developed in disciplines such
   as cultural anthropology. A common feature of these theories, it is
   argued, lies in their rejection of ``territorialized{''} concepts of
   ``cultures{''} as self-enclosed, homogeneous entities and in their
   emphasis on the interconnectedness of culture in a world of globalized
   modernity. Following a discussion of concepts of ``inter{''}-,
   ``multi{''}-, and ``trans{''}national culture, the final part of the
   article argues that contemporary literature is increasingly produced in
   transcultural contexts and that literary studies need to develop new
   theoretical and methodological approaches to respond to this challenge.

   only enable literary studies to stay in touch with the dynamics of
   contemporary literature, but will also allow literary studies to make

Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{3-7}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Choice behaviour can be viewed as a response to reinforcement
   determined by an interaction between the quantities, delays and
   probabilities of two outcomes. The variation in the perceived value of
   a reinforcer with alteration of these factors (discounting) can be
   modelled mathematically by hyperbolic discounting functions. Making
   risky choices is a feature of impulsivity and has been associated with
   reduced serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) function. In this study,
   we investigated the possible role of 5-HT in modulating probability
   discounting using the technique of acute tryptophan (TRP) depletion in
   subjects undertaking an imaginary gambling task. The gambling task
   consisted of choosing between two `roulette-like' dials: `A' which
   provided a smaller but nearly certain `win' and `B' which gave a `win'
   2.5 times the amount with a probability that was systematically varied.
   A series of reward sizes on dial `A' was presented ranging from 10
   pence to pound10 000. The probability of winning on dial `B' at which
   the subjects valued the two dials equally (indifference point) was
   determined as a measure of willingness to take a risk. Subjects were
   more likely to take a risk for smaller rewards but the indifference
   points in the 15 subjects who received TRP depletion did not differ
   from 13 who had the control drink. On a surprise retesting 1 week later
   there was a trend (p < 0.07) for subjects to be more willing to take
   risks the second time, particularly in the case of small rewards. This
   study does not support a role for 5-HT in modulating probabilistic
   choice in agreement with recent evidence from experiments with animals;
   however, the imaginal nature of the task and modest numbers may have
   influenced the result.}},

   of 30 special educators drawn from the results of a wider random sample
   survey of 765 respondents in response to a burnout questionnaire. We
   found that Lacan's distinction between imaginary and symbolic
   functioning allows us to make a difference between high and low
   scorers. High scorers - among whom two subtypes can be distinguished -
   function mainly in an imaginary way. Among low scorers we similarly
   found two subgroups - one that interacts symbolically and one that
   interacts imaginarily, but in which latter case environmental factors

   Americans share master narratives about agin-often drawn from the

   time from the capitalist changes around them, allowing for little or no

   societies actually sought to foreclose the future and other spaces. The
   paradox is that capitalist development, with its admitted inequities

   with them their own virtues. In spite of the ameliorative tendencies of
   utopias, their limitations, that is, their closed-mindedness, slowly

   feature or may be evoked regressively in global or circumscribed ways.
   It causes a general disinhibition of instincts and impulses attended by
   a sense of confidence, exhiliration, and exuberance. The aesthetic
   illusion is a combination of illusions: (1) that the daydream embodied
   by the work of art is the beholder's own, the artist being ignored, and
   (2) that the artistically described protagonist is a real person with a
   real ``world.{''} The first illusion arises through the beholder's
   emotional-instinctual gratification from his or her own fantasy-memory
   constellations; the second comes about because the beholder, by taking
   the protagonist as proxy, mobilizes the subjective experience of the
   imaginary protagonist's ``reality.{''} The first illusion is necessary
   for the second to take place; the second establishes the aesthetic
   illusion proper. Both illusions are instances of magic. Accordingly,
   the aesthetic illusion is accompanied by a heady experience of
   excitement and euphoria. The relation among the aesthetic illusion,
   magic, and enthusiasm is illustrated by an analytic case, J. D.
   Salinger's ``The Laughing Man,{''} Woody Allen's Play It Again, Sam,
   Don Quixote, and the medieval Cult of the Saints.}},

Abstract = {{In their substantive introduction, the editors first revisit two
   classical sites of controversy which have offered frameworks for
   theorizing the interplay between materiality and sociality: reification
   and fetishism. Obviously, these critical vocabularies emerge as crucial
   sites of perplexity as soon as the ontological boundary between
   subjects and objects is rendered equally problematic and fluid as the
   epistemological boundary between the imaginary and the real. A
   thumbnail sketch of the history of the two discursive traditions (from
   Marxism up to Actor Network Theory) provides an elaborate systematic
   framework for introducing the individual articles. The first axis of
   debate is generated by conceptual residues of the traditional
   tug-of-war between idealism and materialism which continues to
   infiltrate recent redescriptions of the web of sociality/materiality.
   The concern here is how much autonomy and agency can be granted to
   material objects in view of their social inscription and symbolic
   construction, and how far conceptual experiments with the ontological
   symmetry between humans and nonhumans may take us and/or should be
   permitted to go. The second axis of debate concerns the fate of
   critical theory and of ethico-political sensibility in the face of
   heightened uncertainties about the distinction between what is real,
   what is constructed, and what is imaginary, and between what may count
   as a person and what as a thing.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The past ten years have brought about a profound reordering of the
   spatial imaginary of Europe. It is a reordering, however, that
   continues to this day, and the tracing (symbolic as well as
   institutional) of the future `Eastern' confine of the common European
   space remains a highly contested - and politically salient - issue.
   This paper examines one alternative geographical imaginary seeking to
   narrate and negate this emergent confine and its binary division of the
   European space by drawing upon the memory of the multinational
   Austro-Hungarian empire. In particular, I look to the ways in which the
   Habsburg myth is being adopted and articulated within the context of
   the erstwhile Austrian province of Galicja - now torn between the
   states of Poland and the Ukraine and straddling the probable future
   border of the European Union. Through. an analysis of the spatial
   imaginary of the imperial Galicja felix, the paper attempts to trace
   the ways in which the Habsburg ideal of a liminal space of
   multinational coexistence is being resurrected in the present day in
   order to subvert the (national and soon supranational) borderlines
   cutting through these territories' heart - and to argue for their
   reconceptualization as a wholly European border-space.}},

Abstract = {{The object of this study was to investigate the attitudes of

   (PAS), active voluntary euthanasia (AVE) and passive euthanasia (PE) in
   Finland.
   Respondents received a postal questionnaire to evaluate the
   acceptability of euthanasia in five scenarios, which were imaginary
   patient cases. Age, severity of pain and prognosis of the disease were
   presented as background factors in these scenarios.
   This work was carried out in Finland in 1998.
   The respondents include a random selection of 814 physicians (506
   responded, 62\%), 800 nurses (582 responded, 68\%) and 1000
   representatives of the general public (587 responded, 59\%).
   Thirty-four percent of the physicians, 46\% of the nurses and 50\% of
   the general public agreed that euthanasia would be acceptable in some
   situations. Of the scenarios, PE was most often considered acceptable
   in cases of severe dementia (physicians 88\%, nurses 79\% and general
   public 64\%). In the same scenario, 8\% of physicians, 23\% of nurses
   and 48\% of general public accepted AVE. In the scenario of an
   incurable cancer, 20\% of the physicians, 34\% of the nurses and 42\%
   of the general public accepted PAS. All forms of euthanasia were
   generally more acceptable in older, than in younger, scenario patients.
   This paper conclude that PE was largely accepted among Finnish medical
   professionals and the general public. Only a minority favored AVE and

   men and women should be especially satisfied with their imaginary

Abstract = {{Anthropologists, historians, and political scientists have pointed to

   Going beyond the conventional view of the cacique as an effective

   vanishing mediator who both unveils and masks the absence of a center
   while standing for the corrupt and venal side of the state.
   Furthermore, it is through the orchestration of enjoyment and the image
   of excessive power that the cacique contributes to the reproduction of
   a particular mode of hegemony. I illustrate these performative and
   imaginary processes by drawing on an ethnography of a regional cacique

Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{505-524}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Over the last decade we have seen a notable shift in the urban
   sociology literature from discourses of division to discourses of
   difference. This shift has opened up new ways of understanding the
   complexities of city life and the formation of heterogeneous
   subjectivities and identities in the spaces of the city. There has
   been, we argue, a worrying tendency in this process to lose an analysis
   of the workings of power. While early Marxist, feminist and
   race/ethnicity debates were firmly located within a framework which
   highlighted power, post-structuralist debates have operated with a more
   fluid notion of power, which at times has become so fluid as to
   evaporate into thin air. Our intention here is to re-emphasise the
   significance of power while holding on to the concept of difference. We
   do this by using the notion of power networks that operate at different
   temporal and spatial scales. These give the city contrasting
   spatialities and temporalities that overlap one another. The city is
   seen as a palimpsest of time-space networks that capture some of the
   `presence of difference' as well as suggesting its absences. These
   time-space networks of power are considered in the material, perceived
   and imaginary realms in relation to bodies, interests and symbols.}},

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{73}},

Abstract = {{This article explains that the Chinese nation-building in modern times,
   which is based on the theory of a common ancestor -- Huangdi (Yellow
   Emperor) or Yan-Huang (Yan and Yellow Emperors)-- is not a new
   invention but the most recent stage in the long formative process of
   the Chinese people. During the late Warring States period, Huangdi was
   claimed to be the common ancestor of the Huaxia people. As an ancestral
   symbol he integrated metaphors of territorial, political and kinship
   implications. After that, the newly formed Huaxia ethnic entity
   expanded into both her geopolitical and social peripheries. By adopting
   a surname and the concomitant genealogical memory, more and more
   non-Han leading families in China's geopolitical peripheries and
   families in her social peripheries, were able to commemorate Huangdi
   directly or indirectly by assumed blood ties. Finally, with this
   background and augmented by the individualism fostered by modern
   nationalism, Chinese intellectuals of the later qing and early
   Republican era built up blood ties between Huangdi and all Chinese
   people. Based on the case of the Sinicized Qiang people in northwestern
   Sichuan, this article also explains that social discrimination and
   emulation among neighboring peoples in China's peripheral regions are a
   primary mechanism through which the expansion of ``the offspring of
   Yellow Emperor and Yan Emperor{''} in those areas came about. In
   conclusion, this article suggests that the so-called modern imagination
   of the Chinese nation is actually based on a historical continuum from
   ancient times. The term ``Descendents of Huangdi{''} represents this
   historical continuum in the long process that resulted in the formation
   of the Chinese nation as an ethnic entity. The truly imaginary or
   inventive elements in the construction of the Chinese nation, and the
   resulting rupture between the past and the present, came from the use
   or abuse of modern linguistics, physiology, ethnology and archaeology
   in the nation-building process.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of a study on non-decompensated psychosis, the case of
   G.J. Schaefer has been examined, as his writings permit the
   delimitation of a particular fantasy, a certain image. However, J.
   Lacan emphasized that no imaginary structure, presented on its own, was
   capable of providing a means of analysing and determining the clinical
   structure. The pertinence of this observation is further supported by
   the fact that fantasy, to be grasped, is to be situated within the
   register of the symbolic and the real. It is only by this means that we
   can determine the functions of fantasy and its connections with the
   psychic structure of the subject. Also, as regards psychosis, J.
   Lacan's examination of the subject of jouissance provides insight into
   the attitude of an individual, such as that of G.J. Schaefer, in whose
   writings the recurrence of the image that has thus taken form becomes
   an indicator of the medium through which jouissance is obtained. This
   pleasure appears to be unregulated; this is implied by the insistent
   and crude emergence of the object to be disposed of, with nothing that
   could possibly be concealed. Here, we hypothesize that the formation of
   the subject's imaginary world compensate for his deficiency in the
   phallic function, thereby avoiding further psychotic development. In
   conclusion, we emphasize the importance of the approach to these
   clinical and psychopathological issues, and consider that the heuristic
   perspective and basic value should be viewed through the concept
   of,structure, or in other words the structuring of the subject closely
   connected to the Other. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe a different type of self- injurious behavior

   Method: Single case report.
   Results: We reported a case of an individual who have developed the
   self- destructive habit of pulling and severely scraping hairs and
   debris out of the mucous membrane of his nasal cavities. We have
   proposed the term rhinotrichotillomania to emphasize the
   phenomenological overlapping between trichotillomania ( TTM) and
   rhinotillexomania ( RTM) exhibited by this case. The main motivation
   behind the patient's actions was a distressing preoccupation with an
   imaginary defect in his appearance, which constitutes the core
   characteristic of BDD. The patient was successfully treated with
   imipramine.
   Conclusion: The case suggests that certain features of TTM, RTM, and
   BDD may overlap and produce serious clinical consequences. Patients
   with this condition may benefit from a trial of tricyclics when other
   effective medications, such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are not

   colonialism and its aftermaths, and state territoriality and its
   contestation, in the work of two popular Northwest Coast landscape
   painters: Emily Carr and Lawrence Paul Yuxweluptun. The work of both
   artists is explored in tern-is of their representation of relations
   between indigenous peoples, physical landscapes, state power, and
   modernity, and in the context of ongoing political struggles over land,
   resources and the environment between First Nations and the Canadian
   government. The paper also calls attention to the multiple and
   fractured nature of postcolonial visualities, to the discursive,
   social, technological and institutional relations that shape how
   landscapes are experienced and represented, and, ultimately, to the
   trace of colonial pasts in the environmental and political imaginaries
   of a postcolonial present.}},

   Examination of mothers' ratings indicated no differences between groups

   significantly higher for imaginary companion children as a result of
   differences on the concentration and worry-over sensitivity subscales.
   However, the mean scores were still within the normal range.

Abstract = {{This essay explores Greek and British observations on the phenomenon of

   known as `The Dilessi/Marathon Murders' (1870). Brigandage in Greece
   was extensively discussed abroad after the foundation of the Greek
   state in the 1830s. The Dilessi Murders, however, triggered a debate in
   Britain on Greece's inability to become a fully modernized state. Other
   European voices, sympathetic or not, also joined this debate. The
   unhappy coincidence of this `trial' with the creation of the
   Neohellenic imagined community produced an internal (Greek) debate that
   was nicely reflected in the rhetoric of Greek journalism and
   administration. in this debate brigandage was represented as an
   `epidemic' phenomenon communicated to Greece from Turkey. The Turks had
   managed to contaminate the `nation' with the help of the Vlachs and the
   Albanians who lived within the Greek Kingdom. Their populations were
   subsequently expelled from the `nation' through a series of symbolic
   actions. This discourse, which was crystallized after the Dilessi
   Affair, assumed a double function in the Greek imaginary: as a response
   to British and indeed European accusations of Greek backwardness, and
   as an expression of the Vlachian/Albanian contribution to the process
   of Neohellenic self-recognition.}},

   analogy is an essential component in the attempt to justify moral
   beliefs. I seek to show how analogical argument both encapsulates and
   exercises the notions of rationality and imagination and that the
   construction, development, and comparison of analogies fundamentally
   underpins ethical argument. In so doing, it enables us to adopt
   imaginative and ethically illuminating perspectives but in a manner
   that does not relinquish any claims to intellectual rigour. I present a
   critique of a brand of ``moral particularism{''} by showing how it
   cannot, if construed in a certain way, adequately conceive of how we
   use analogies and imaginary cases in ethics. Although such a
   particularism is thus impotent with regard to ethical debate, I show
   that the wider motivation behind particularism that can be extracted is
   of clear relevance and importance to medical practitioners.}},

   predictions as to where a ball would land after being dropped through a

   problems, children's understanding of when evidence was necessary, and
   children's evaluation of form and evidence. Data were analyzed in two
   ways: (1) by comparing differences across participants on component
   questions and (2) an individual analysis examining the consistency of
   responses to component questions across the problem set. Overall, the
   results indicated that: (1) sixth graders tended to differentiate
   logical from empirical problems while preschool and third grade
   children rarely did; (2) young children tend to ignore both the logical
   connective and the second half of problems-termed a `cut;' (3) these
   cuts are less frequent when a problem is compatible with one empirical
   possibility; (4) cuts do not stem from encoding or recall effors, but
   seem to be the product of incomplete problem processing and (5) from
   third to sixth grade, children's understanding of logical form
   increased as the rate of cuts decreased. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Abstract = {{Disappointed in the reception of his opera Macbeth and torn between
   what he considered opposing French and German musical aesthetics,
   Ernest Bloch, together with his librettist and friend Edmond Fleg,
   turned to Jewish topics under the influence of another friend, the
   anti-Semite Robert Godet. Relying on archival documents and musical
   analysis, this article traces the development of Bloch's assumed Jewish
   identity from his projected opera Jezabel through his violoncello
   rhapsody Schelomo. Although both works display similar stylistic
   characteristics, the change between what is conceived as ``Jewish{''}
   in the one and the other is significant. In Jezabel Bloch depicted an
   imaginary pure world of the Jews with diatonic, simple melodies and
   painted the pagan Jezebel with the lush chromaticism associated with
   Oriental sensuality; in Schelomo he interpreted the chromatic,
   augmented-second-ridden style as expressive of Jewishness. Schelomo
   thus fulfilled the expectations of Bloch's audiences by playing into
   stereotypes of Jewish music. Ironically then, the anti-Semitism that
   was a major factor in driving Bloch to find a particularly Jewish voice
   also inspired the corroboration of a musical style that, like the
   society around him, marked Jews as others.}},

Abstract = {{For many rationalist observers, organizational dysfunctions, such as
   recurrent failures in the implementation of strategic orientations, the
   constantly aggressive behaviour of managers, and so on, are nothing
   other than manifestation of deficiencies in decision-making or in the
   well thought-out application of decisions. In the light of
   psychoanalysis, however, such phenomena can be regarded differently, in
   particular as compulsions to repeat or actings-out. Indeed, in this
   perspective, it is on a `stage' other than that of `reality' that the
   game is played out: the stage of the imaginary and unconscious symbolic
   determinations. The object of this article is to propose a fresh
   reading of organizational life based on the work of Jacques Lacan.
   Although Lacanian notions are often seen as posing numerous problems
   for those brought up in an Anglo-American tradition of intellectual
   endeavour, this article upholds that such notions suggest rigorous
   alternative ways of approaching organizations.}},

Abstract = {{The rational conceptual philosophical thinking originated in ancient
   Greece on the basis of mythical imaginary thinking. The
   bipolar-complementary thinking still had its place in Miletian
   philosophy, although not in the form of images, but in the form of
   conceptual variants and archetypal representations of archaic ontology.
   The Dynosian cult and orfism contributed to the development of rational
   thinking through the realization of the individuality and the notion of
   the only genuine divinity - Zeus, which at the same time embodied the
   whole universe. On the basis of these ideas Xenophanes built up his
   conceptual image as the fixed and the only essence of the universe, but
   Pythagoras his conception of fixed and unchangeable numeral essences.
   Then came Parmenides, who founded the metaphysics through the
   determination of the duality of One and Many, the being and the
   non-being. It was a dichotomic break and turning away of the
   bipolar-complementary thinking from the dualistic type of thinking.
   This author's claim is supported by Parmenides criticism of his
   predecessors. Parmenides elevated the Being to a ``pure concept{''} or
   abstraction. This radical turn in the history of Greek thinking meant
   not only the dismissal of the previous philosophical views, but also
   the beginning of the rational abstract thinking on the basis of logical
   laws, namely the law of excluded middle and the law of contradiction.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout the past two centuries, over five hundred writers have
   emigrated to Quebec under a variety of conditions and circumstance. The
   contribution of these writers to Quebec literary life has been
   considerable: the proportion of foreigners among writers is twice as
   large as among the general population. At the edge of literary
   movements or at the heart of the construction of national imaginary
   systems, emigre writers have different trajectories depending on their
   time of arrival, origin, language and professional status. From the
   revolutionary intellectuals and ultramontaine priests of the nineteenth
   century (Napoleon Aubin, Jules-Paul Tardivel) to the great travelers
   and exiles of the early twentieth (Marie Le Franc, Louis Hemon), from
   the first wave of European immigration after World War II (Monique
   Bosco, Marco Micone) to the continental diversification of the end of
   the century (Ying Chen, Sergio Kokis, Tecia Werbowski), the history of
   literary immigration impels us to reread the boundaries and elements of
   Quebec's cultural history.}},

Abstract = {{This paper builds upon Watts and Peet's notion of an `environmental
   imaginary' to conceptualise the distinctive ways in which the politics
   of nature are inserted into urban regeneration strategies. In
   particular, it seeks to examine how regional discursive formations
   frame the scope for a transformation of urban ecological politics. The
   chosen case study, the redevelopment of Cardiff Bay, would seem to have
   offered a significant opportunity for fashioning a more radical urban
   ecological politics, because the strategy's proponents bridged social
   and ecological worlds in an unusually explicit way in their
   justificatory narratives of dispossession, bound up with a major
   physical reconstruction of the dockland environment. These narratives
   are shown to be grounded in the historical development of the
   near-hegemonic regional coalitions of south Welsh politics, and to
   unfold in the treatment of both the ethnic minority residential
   community within Cardiff's docks, and the estuarine environment, as
   `deviant' in a number of respects-in need of `reclamation' and
   `integration' with the rest of Cardiff and Wales as a whole. The
   analysis considers why radical ecological politics failed to develop
   and whether the contradictions inherent in the regeneration strategy
   might yet encourage its emergence.}},

   analyzed. Confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses failed to
   confirm that the measures associated with the New Look theory, the New
   Imaginary Audience Scale, and the New Personal Fable Scale (NPFS),
   tapped a common underlying construct. Only the invulnerability and
   omnipotence subscales of the NPFS proved to be highly related. In line
   with the New Look theory, boys were found to believe more strongly in
   their own uniqueness, invulnerability, and omnipotence than were girls.
   Higher scores on the invulnerability and omnipotence subscales were
   associated with lower levels of depression and loneliness. Finally,
   each aspect of the personal fable seemed to have its own specific role
   in the process of separation-individuation. Implications of these
   findings for the New Look theory of the imaginary audience and the
   personal fable are discussed. Suggestions for future research are put
   forth, with particular emphasis on the role of the

   scores that reflect their combination-output precedence and
   dominance/rank. Other participants drew and described novel exemplars
   of those categories that might exist on an imaginary planet and
   reported on the factors that influenced their creations. References to
   Earth animals, tools, or fruit were used to determine imagination
   frequency (the number of participants who mentioned relying on
   particular Earth exemplars). Items high in accessibility were also high
   in imagination frequency, implying that those items that come to mind
   most readily are the ones most likely to serve as starting points for
   the development of novel ideas. This result held even when task
   constraints weighed against the use of such items (Experiment 2) and

   Empire became expensive. It could not be ruled uniformly or in detail
   and different governance structures emerged. In the settler colonies,
   relatively autonomous `self-government' embodying variants of British
   precedents and institutions, provided a loose coupling of centre and
   periphery. The accounting associations that developed in this type of
   colony were, then, not compliant clones of the centre but hybrids
   reflecting the specificity of place and British accommodation of
   peripheral demands. The result was the emergence of an imperial
   accountancy arena. These empirics contribute to our understanding of
   the nineteenth century professionalisation of accounting as a
   cross-border phenomenon by showing how the strength of weak ties
   between parts of a periphery characterised by inter-colony differences

   the two lower squares. Shortly thereafter, the distribution of

   Responses to targets presented at a noncued location that was at the

Abstract = {{The art of the medieval gunner ({''}Buchsenmeister{''}) consisted of
   engineering and practical skills required in converting weak black
   powder ('serpentine' and `lump powder') into highly compressed
   propellant gasses which threw projectiles like arrows, lead shots and
   stones from small guns. Nevertheless, the invention of shooting
   gunpowder weapons wasn't based on chemical achievements, but deeply
   depended on the technique of charging a firearm in a complicated way.
   So all theories concerning the ``discovery of true gunpowder{''} as
   conditio sine qua non for the European origin of gunpowder artillery
   are misleading. There never was any ``powder monk{''} like the
   imaginary Berthold Schwarz (i.e. niger Bertholdus, a nigromanticus) or
   even the historical figure of Roger Bacon, who in fact described
   gunpowder recipes without inventing anything. This study deals with the
   internal ballistics of early cannons during the first one hundred
   years, from the Loshult gun (about 1330) to Rothenburg's mortars

   correlations. Parfit's argument depends on our hypothesizing away a
   number of facts which play a central role in our understanding and
   employment of the very concept under investigation; as a result it
   fails to establish what Parfit claims, namely, that identity is not
   what matters. I argue that Parfit's conclusion can be blocked without
   denying that he has presented an imaginary case where prudential
   concern would be rational in the absence of identity. My analysis
   depends on the recognition that the features that explain or justify a
   relation may be distinct from the features that underpin it as

   object-related knowledge is involved in the production of
   imaginary-object gestures. 35 children (12 3-, 11 4-, and 12
   5-yr.-olds) performed gestural tasks in which they were asked to
   pretend to use common objects, e.g., ``pretend to brush your teeth with
   a toothbrush.{''} In addition, they were asked to describe the
   relationship between the performed gesture and object when they were
   pretending. Analysis indicated that, when an imaginary-object gesture
   was performed, it was through an evoked prior knowledge of the function
   and context of the use of objects. This may suggest that object-related
   knowledge is a key factor involved in developmental changes from body
   part to imaginary-object gestures and that it is involved in freeing
   preschool children from object substitution, which is prescribed by
   perceptual support.}},

Abstract = {{Humans can reach for objects with their hands whether the objects axe
   seen, heard or touched. Thus, the position of objects is recoded in a
   joint-centered frame of reference regardless of the sensory modality
   involved. Our study indicates that this frame of reference is not the
   only one shared across sensory modalities. The location of reaching
   targets is also encoded in eye-centered coordinates, whether the
   targets are visual, auditory, proprioceptive or imaginary. Furthermore,
   the remembered eye-centered location is updated after each eye and head
   movement. This is quite surprising since, in principle, a reaching
   motor command can be computed from any non-visual modality without ever
   recovering the eye-centered location of the stimulus. This finding may
   reflect the predominant role of vision in human spatial perception. (C)

Pages = {{2149-2173}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{It is now commonplace to assert that the contemporary discursive
   landscape is strewn with an abundance of environmental narratives, Yet
   these stories about nature seldom speak of the material geographies
   that link practices of postindustrial consumption to often-distant
   spaces of commodity supply. A postscarcity narrative in which the
   availability of natural resources no longer poses a limiting factor on
   economic growth, therefore, characterizes the current period. In this
   paper I examine how these narratives of `resource triumphalism'
   construct the nature of commodities and the places that supply them.
   Using a range of sources, I illustrate how extractive spaces are
   constructed through a discursive dialectic which simultaneously erases
   socioecological histories and reinscribes space in the image of the
   commodity. The paper advances the claim that, despite their apparent
   marginality in narratives of postindustrialism, primary
   commodity-supply zones play a key role within broader narratives about
   modernity and social life. I draw on Hetherington's reworking of the
   concept of heterotopia to argue that commodity-supply zones be
   considered contemporary `badlands', marginal spaces in and through
   which broader processes of sociospatial ordering are worked out. By
   examining the geographical imaginaries associated with mineral
   extraction, I demonstrate how contemporary discourses of
   commodity-supply space facilitate the material practices through which
   such ordering occurs.}},

Abstract = {{In the post-independence period in India popular fictions present a
   paradox: they represent the corruption of the era as well as the
   desirability of its modernity. In the work of overwhelmingly successful
   writers such as Shankar, the path of Nehruvian development is a double
   sign. It represents the corruption of the `licenced raj' as well as the
   desirable lifestyle and possessions of the educated elite. The more the
   nation modernises, the more corrupt and desirable it becomes. All the
   noble social goals of the Nehru era-education, women's emancipation,
   progress-become transactional: things to be exchanged for wealth,
   Western technology and status. There is no room for integrity here;
   integrity is possible either in the past or in the West. These fictions
   tell the story of the `deferral' of Western modernity in the imaginary
   of the postcolonial nation. Women, in these fictions, are especially
   ambiguous; though modernised and educated, they also retain their
   traditional roles and conventional gender relationships are valorised.
   This flawed representation of the modern nation also embodies its
   tragedy. This article concludes that the failure of the
   post-independence Nehruvian development project and its noble social
   goals has created a space that allows economic liberalisation and
   religious fundamentalism to flourish.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{For at least the last two-and-a-half decades, critical theory in the
   humanities and social sciences has been concerned, amongst other
   things, with exploding the myths and fictions of nationalist thought.
   Instead of the coherence of `imagined communities', or even the unity
   of the individual subject, it emphasises the multiple, shifting,
   fragmented and often contradictory modes of identification that
   characterise what are referred to variously as the `postmodern',
   `postcolonial', `posthistorical' or `postideological' conditions of the
   contemporary world. Yet recent history has seen a burgeoning of
   nationalist sentiments and struggles, and numerous bloody wars have
   been fought over inclusive and exclusive conceptions of identity. In
   less violent, although no less compelling, ways, countries such as
   South Africa are struggling with the competing demands of difference
   and unity as they seek to reconstruct themselves in more humane and
   equitable ways. Far from disappearing, arguments about national
   belonging and cultural difference have had increased prominence in the
   1990s. The dangers of exclusive or `ethnic' nationalisms are
   graphically evident in the history of the twentieth century. However a
   simple retreat from nationalism into multiplicity, division and
   difference can be immensely disabling in contexts, such as the South
   African one, in which the rebuilding of society requires a common
   commitment and a sense of shared responsibility. In this article, I
   investigate the possibility of reconciling the demands of difference
   and national belonging. Specifically, I argue for what I call a
   recuperated or revindicated nationalism, based not on the fictions of
   imagined unity, but on a shared problematic: a mutual implication in a
   history of difference, which acknowledges local as well as global
   affiliations. The humanities and social sciences have a crucial role to
   play in the developing of these understandings and, towards the end of
   the article, 1 set out what I perceive to be the challenges of this
   project for those involved in such teaching and research. I argue
   against a short-sighted state tertiary educational policy in South
   Africa which, despite its rhetoric of human development and
   Africanisation, promotes the `hard' over the `human' sciences.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MIND AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{219-248}},
Month = {{SUM}},
Abstract = {{The Jamesian streams of consciousness are each made up of states of
   consciousness one at a time in tight temporal succession except when a
   stream stops flowing momentarily or for a longer time. These pulses of
   mentality are typically complex in the sense of their possessing, each
   of them, many ingredients or features. But, also, every state of
   consciousness is, in a different sense, simple: a unitary awareness, a
   single mental act. Although unitary, a state of consciousness often has
   many objects, which have some kind of existence, past, present, or
   future, or which are nonexistent, merely apparent, only imaginary. The
   problem concerning the intrinsic nature of states of consciousness is
   what they are themselves, not what they are about or what they may seem
   to be about, but what are their own intrinsic properties. For example,
   in my view, conscious states are, literally, certain occurrent states
   of the brain. In James's different view, conscious states are mental in
   the sense of nonphysical yet directly produced by the total brain
   process or by a substantial part of it. In our attempts to determine
   the intrinsic properties of states of consciousness, we are well
   advised to attend to our inner aware, ness of them. Any true statement
   about a state of consciousness that we may succeed in formulating from
   the first-person perspective is, in my view, a fact concerning a brain
   state and may help us to learn which among the occurrent brain states
   are actually the states of consciousness. Their being unitary
   awarenesses is among the facts we know firsthand about the states of
   consciousness. I can think of no instance of such a state that is
   missing the property of intentionality, the property of its being at
   least as though about something. Also, although we may distinguish
   various ingredients belonging to a state of consciousness - a state can
   be, for example, an auditory, a visual, a sexual, a memorial, and an
   anticipatory experience, all at the same time these ingredients are not
   apprehended side by side, but as integrated together in a unitary
   state. It will be argued that how we find firsthand a state of
   consciousness to be is illusory, that any such state is actually made
   up of separate processes. But this claim has its own problems,
   including having to explain the difference between two simultaneous
   states of consciousness belonging each of them to a different stream
   and an integral state that includes several different kinds of
   experience.}},

Abstract = {{How does discourse work in everyday development situations and how does

   questions, this paper argues, we have to follow how local actors use
   different development discourses in practice. Using the case of an
   indigenous women's organization in the Philippines, the paper explores
   what local development initiatives tell us about the meaning of
   development and social change in a village. Stepping away from notions
   about hegemonic discourse, the argument is based on the duality of
   discourse, where actors on the one hand find room for maneuver in a
   multiplicity of discourses, and on the other create realities beyond
   their intentions by enacting particular discourses. To study this, the
   paper adopts a two-step approach. First, three local meanings of
   development are identified: development as improving the village; as
   helping those in need; and as bringing personal benefit. Second, an
   interface analysis is used, focusing on negotiations at real or
   imaginary meeting points of different discourses. Research found that
   women's use of development discourses plays into processes of social
   ordering, in particular by eroding the status of peasant women in favor
   of educated professionals.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this research was to define the way in which

   decision of a group of women to be put under complicated reproductive
   treatments such as in vitro fertilization. Patients previously
   diagnosed with primary sterility, who wanted to try assisted human
   reproduction (AHR) treatments, specifically those candidates for in
   vitro fertilization techniques (IVF), were remitted to a public health
   institution. Interviews were made to a hundred candidates, ten of which
   were selected to be amply studied. The methodology employed was
   interpretative in a grounded theory design. This instrument helped to
   build categories that deepened and broaded the phenomenon under study.
   Two constant factors that affected the decision of the studied group
   were found: narcisistic personality and the imaginary child. This
   analysis included the study, of other factors such as gender, family
   pressures, medical institution, and side effects of this treatment.
   Through rigorous analysis the information was codified by specific
   methods (axial coding, selective coding) that allowed the design of a
   preliminar model that explained the founded categories, their
   relationship and the temporary procces involved. These results could
   help in further investigations as a tool for ginecologists and
   professionals of mental health to increase their comprehension of this
   population. In order to find applications of the previous results, it
   was suggested to work with a psychoterapy designed for women who

   tropology of pre-World War I Oxford idealist philosophy, which
   celebrates the ``dawning of consciousness{''} in the subcontinent with
   the advent of union in 1910 which the essay relates to Hegel's views of
   Africa and Egypt; second, the ubiquitous influence of Freemasonry in
   Britain and the British Empire at the turn of the nineteenth century,
   in particular Freemasonary's concern with Egyptology; third, the varied
   impulses behind the concept of the Cape as Mediterranean, from climate
   to architecture, tourism, and ethnography; and fourth, the mutually
   supporting roles of journalism, travel, and performance in rehearsing a
   national act of identity formation. The Cape-to-Cairo idea coincides
   with the historical moment of the forging of union. It also coincides
   with a period of transition in Western culture from the late Victorian
   age to modernism. This essay suggests that these broad issues of
   national identity formation and of simultaneous transition between two
   different cultural milieus, which are evident as much in the dominant
   nations of Europe at the time as they are in the making of South
   Africa, may be tracked in a reconstruction of the complex of cultural
   epiphenomena that surrounded and propagated for several decades the
   fantasy of the Cape-to-Cairo axis.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines ``Black Hamlet{''}, written in 1937 by the
   pioneering South African psychoanalyst Wulf Sachs. Sach's book stages a
   cultural exchange in the guise of a professional dialogue between the
   author and a Manyika healer-deviner given the pseudonym John
   Chavafambira in the book. Sachs reports the dialogue extensively and
   stages it artfully, yet the superiority of Western medical-scientific
   and psychoanalytic practices to traditional African healing remains his
   governing premise throughout the book. When Sachs identities John as
   the ``black Hamlet{''}, he accordingly proclaims the universal
   applicability of psychoanalysis, grounded in the Oedipus Complex. This
   paper argues that Sach's attempt to inscribe the South African native
   subject within the global imaginary of 1930s psychoanalysis proves
   subject both to reversals and transferential complications that render
   the entire enterprise highly ironic; the racialized unconscious
   ultimately on display is that of the analyst rather than his subject.
   Rather than assimilating the native subject then, psychoanalysis finds
   itself exposed in a setting conceived as alien. As a complex cultural
   text, ``Black Hamlet{''} actively lends itself to the postcolonial
   critique of universalizing Western psychoanalysis.}},

   levels, by providing a full semantic analysis of evaluative judgments
   nd by arguing that anti-realism is compatible with moral aspiration
   despite the non-existence of obligations as the externalist imagines
   them. A moral judgment consists of separate descriptive and
   prescriptive components and is to be understood as a declarative
   statement prefaced by an `ideality operator'. Moral beliefs are
   genuinely representational, but their truth conditions can only be
   stated with reference to imaginary ideal worlds. Moral judgments are
   neither confirmed nor verified but alternative moral positions are
   preferentially endorsed and adopted by individual agents on the basis
   of their perceived all-things-considered optimality. High aspiration
   moralities are normally very costly to agents in terms of their
   prudential and aesthetic interests, but they are theoretically as
   eligible as the adoption of other, less demanding sets of rules.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Located just north of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, the largest and oldest of
   China's Special Economic Zone (SEZ) has been both a project and symbol
   of post-Mao modernization. In this paper, I trace how the Shenzhen
   built environment mediates images and experiences of `Hong Kong',
   arguing that transnationality in the SEZ is an everyday practice where
   tradition, colonialism, and the Cold War provide raw materials for the
   local reworking of the changing relationship between the Chinese state
   apparatus and finance capital. My story has a double focus: the
   ideology of urbanization as modernization and historic preservation. On
   the one hand, the ideology of urbanization-as-modernization legitimates
   a spatial order in which the rural is always posed to be superseded by
   the urban. Both the rural and the urban are empty signifiers that are
   created through comparison and deployed to guide action. In this
   important sense,'Hong Kong' has been urban with respect to rural
   `Shenzhen' (formerly Baoan County), even as `Shenzhen' has been urban
   with respect to the Chinese hinterland (neidi). On the other hand,
   historic preservation domesticates `Hong Kong' as Shenzhen's past
   through the figure of Xin'an County, the geographic predecessor of both
   Shenzhen and Hong Kong. These complimentary displacements produce a
   nostalgia peculiar to the SEZ: a desire for a past that entitles
   contemporary Shenzhen residents to Hong Kong's prosperity. This
   nostalgia is structured with reference to a shared origin Xin'an
   County-where Hong Kong's postwar history (1950-1979) becomes the past
   that Shenzhen (rural Baoan) would have had, if not for a cruel twist of
   socialist fate.}},

Abstract = {{Through an extensive allegorical reading of films, this paper attempts
   to capture a certain cultural form of imagination in Hong Kong during
   the transitional period leading up to the historical handover of power
   in 1997. Dwelling on the world of signification conjured up through
   what I call the jianghu filmic imaginary, the analysis focuses on the
   ideological and utopian impulses registered in relation to a whole
   emotional complex of anxiety, bewilderment and despair in the works of
   some highly creative local filmmakers of the genre: Ching Siu-Tong, Ann
   Hui, Tsui Hark and Wong Kar-Wai. The study draws theoretically from
   Castoriadis's notion of the social imaginary and Bloch's aesthetics of
   hope, to focus on the textual and contextual re-constructions of a
   number of very unconventional martial arts swordplay (wuxia) films made
   in Hong Kong in the last two decades: namely, Tsui's Butterfly Murders
   (1979), Hui's Romance of Book and Sword (1987), Ching/Tsui's Swordsman
   II (1992), and Wong's Ashes of Time (1994). By identifying the
   ideological and affective moments in the filmic imaginary, I want to
   trace what has been left in a ruined culture for utopian longings, and
   point to the presence/absence of `hope' as the cultural imagination for
   an unknown and unknowable future (beyond 1997). It is my contention
   that an understanding of that peculiar form of popular imaginary at the
   unusual juncture of Hong Kong's history can begin with a critical
   attempt to cope with this subtle practice of hope, so as to recognize
   (or reject) it as mediation in the process of our collective cultural
   crisis, anticipation and identification.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{`Kung fu', as a cultural imaginary consecrated in Hong Kong cinema
   since the 1970s, was constituted in a flux of nationalism. This paper
   argues that the kung fu imaginary found in Hong Kong kung fu cinema is
   imbued with an underlying self-dismantling operation that denies its
   own effectiveness in modern life, and betrays an `originary' moment of
   heterogeneity, an origin of itself as already `impurely Chinese'.
   Having been British-colonized, westernized, capitalist-polluted and
   culturally hybrid, Hong Kong's relation with `Chineseness' is at best
   an ambivalent one. This ambivalence embodies a critical significance of
   Hong Kong as a defusing hybrid other within a dominant centralizing
   Chinese ideology, which is itself showing signs of falling apart
   through complex changes imposed by global capital. Hong Kong's kung fu
   imaginary, which operates in a self-negating mode, is instructive when
   read as a tactic of intervention at the historical turn from colonial
   modernity to the city's reluctant return to the fatherland. The kung fu
   imaginary enacts a continuous unveiling of its own incoherence, and
   registers Hong Kong's anxious process of self-invention. If Hong Kong's
   colonial history makes the city a troublesome supplement, then the
   `Hong Kong cultural imaginary' will always be latently subversive,
   taking to task delusive forms of `unitary national imagination'.}},

   60 medical oncologists, 128 clinical oncologists, 72 palliative care
   physicians, 58 general practitioners and 59 qualified nurses working
   within oncology. Using a questionnaire presenting two typical but

   would be acceptable to them and, if so, what minimum chance and
   duration of benefit would make treatment worthwhile. Demographic and
   social data were also collected. Patients accepted a lower chance of

   of benefit was more evenly spread, patients choosing lower time values
   were over-represented. These results were consistent even when
   treatment involved greater toxicity. The conclusion drawn from this

   benefit than others may imagine. Health care professionals must
   recognize this when discussing treatment options with patients.

Abstract = {{The theory of adolescent egocentrism holds that early adolescents have
   a distorted understanding of self-other relations; because of flaws in
   the traditional methods used to assess adolescent egocentrism, this

   research, the nature of early adolescent social cognition as
   characterized by that theory was investigated by examining age
   differences in judgments of hypothetical peer group conversations. In
   Study 1, children and early adolescents (N = 264) rated the
   attentiveness, criticalness, and admiration expressed in three
   conversations, in which the subject or a peer was mentioned in either
   an admiring, critical, or nonevaluative manner. In Study 2, a similar
   procedure was used with middle and late adolescents, as well as
   children and early adolescents (N = 187); two memory tasks were also

   Study 2 was presented with an ambiguous conversation and then asked to
   interpret who was the target (object of focus) and how that target was

   every move, or that their social cognition and perception is egocentric

Abstract = {{Beatrix Potter (1886-1943), a writer who belongs to the last part of
   the Victorian Age, is one of the representatives of children's
   literature and her twenty-one tales are the living memory of a woman
   who devoted her life to the building of an imaginary world whose
   foundations are based on a striking reality. Although her world is a
   utopia, it is inspired by a model: the London she used to live in, when
   young, and Sawrey, a village in Yorkshire where she spent her life
   until she died. Her tales are the reflection of her ambition as a woman
   of letters and her struggle to achieve a certain integrity. They bring
   out her inner self, with its anxieties, distress, frustrations and her
   fight to exorcise them. They are a sort of outlet, accounts of the
   childhood experiences of the people of her times, and above all, a
   means to understand the mechanisms existing in this period and to
   dismantle them. Her work focuses on recurrent themes such as the
   importance of maternal law, desire or the hero's journey into the self.
   More important are the masculine and feminine images that appear
   through the tales, creating a dialectic of power that consists, at the
   same time, of a movement towards freedom and a regression towards
   archaisms. So, Beatrix Potter's work oscillates between conflicts and
   freedom, subversions and archaisms. The psychological dimension can't
   be forgotten as each tale offers the reader, not truth but a kind of
   wisdom which is shared by all cultures, that is to say, the tales help
   the child to grow up offering him/her, characters to express his/her
   joy and anguish.}},

Abstract = {{Political ecology has become useful for contextualizing concerns of
   discourse, nature, society, and development within specific regional
   settings. Recent attempts to develop an environment-development
   approach within political ecology have produced a myriad of research
   topics that are linked to a diversity of theoretical literatures.
   Increased importance is being placed on conflicting environmental
   imaginaries, and doing contextual environmental histories within
   political ecology. This stems from the need to incorporate agency
   within the broader context of human-nature interaction in order to
   better assess material struggles over the natural environment. This
   paper examines the political ecology of environmental struggle in
   Central Appalachia. Of particular concern is how Central Appalachian
   environmental histories and natural resource struggles produce
   conflicting environmental imaginaries. Recently, conflict has flared
   between local land owners who view natural resources as a means for
   social reproduction and cultural survival, and government and
   environmentalist `outsiders' who view local environmental resources in
   the context of recreational consumption and resource conservation. It
   is concluded that natural resource struggles have internally
   transformed the social, environmental, and economic make-up of Central
   Appalachia, and in turn impacted the ways in which local residents use
   and understand the natural environment. This research also suggests
   that local social movements associated with the ownership, access, and
   use of natural resources are not necessarily progressive, as is often
   suggested in the Appalachian literature. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The present article investigates the relationship between social

   whether socio-political worries (i.e. worries about societal or
   environmental problems) show a different relationship with social
   desirability than worries related to one's social-evaluative
   self-concept (i.e. worries about one's own relationships, future, work,
   or finances). A sample of 155 students responded to self-report
   questionnaires on worry and social desirability, first under standard
   instructions and then under social desirability-provoking instructions
   (imaginary job-application instructions). As expected, results showed
   opposite relationships for socio-political and social-evaluation
   worries. First, socio-political worries showed positive correlations
   with scores from the social desirability questionnaire, whereas
   social-evaluation worries showed negative correlations. Second,
   endorsements of sociopolitical worries increased under social
   desirability-provoking instructions, whereas those of social-evaluation
   worries decreased. However, all correlations between self-reported
   worry and social-desirability scores were rather small. Moreover, in
   absolute terms, socio-political worries did not show any greater
   social-desirability bias than social-evaluation worries. Implications
   for self-report measures of socio-political worries (e.g. environmental
   worry, worry about technological risks) and directions for future

Abstract = {{The present experiments manipulated the modality in which participants
   communicated object directions (by pointing or verbal labelling) in a
   learned layout. and the mode in which they were required to rotate
   (physically or imaginary). The results showed that the pointing
   modality was strongly influenced by the mode of rotation (Experiment
   1). Pointing was faster and more accurate in the physical than in the
   imaginary rotation. In addition, a different pattern of dimension
   accessibility was observed: equi-accessibility in physical rotation
   (front-back = right-left) and standard in imaginary rotation
   (front-back < right-left). By contrast, the verbal modality was less
   influenced by the mode of rotation. The same standard pattern of
   dimension accessibility and similar speed was obtained in physical and
   imaginary rotation. These results are explained by proposing a
   first-order embodiment, typical of ordinary pointing, which involves a
   low-cost sensory-motor updating of object positions and a second-order
   embodiment, most typical of language, which involves a represented
   (rather than physical) self and an object-to-frame high-cost updating.}},

Abstract = {{What conception does psychoanalysis present of man's `socialness'? It
   is certainly a vast subject, and one that can't be covered in a few
   pages. We will only examine one point, which is found in the
   relationship of the individual to society. We will show how Lacan tried
   to get away from this polar opposition, which was imaginary and already
   formed, between the individual and the social, starting from the
   statement, ``the collective is nothing but the subject of the
   individual.{''} This does not mean that the collective should be taken
   as a whole, and analyzed in the same way as an individual. The
   proposition says, of the subject (that is, of the subject of the
   unconscious), happening in a collective dynamic of individuals,
   resulting in a punctual and disappearing consequence of this dynamic.
   The introduction of a third term, `the subject', distinct from the I
   (formed in the imagination), allows the introduction of a compound
   dimension in the individual/collective binary system. For that, the
   temporal determination of the subject's constitution has to be taken
   into account, On these bases, Lacan proposed some original community
   plans, the cartel and the pass. In generalizing the idea of the social
   tie with the writing of spoken words, he proposes to find one's way
   according to the structure of desire and not only, as with Freud,
   according to identification, which binds together the crowd. (C) 2001

Volume = {{139}},

Abstract = {{Healthy humans performed arm movements in a horizontal plane, from an
   initial position toward remembered targets, while the movement and the
   targets were projected on a vertical computer monitor. We analyzed the
   mean error of movement endpoints and we observed two distinct
   systematic error patterns. The first pattern resulted in the clustering
   of movement endpoints toward the diagonals of the four quadrants of an
   imaginary circular area encompassing all target locations (oblique
   effect). The second pattern resulted in a tendency of movement
   endpoints to be closer to the body or equivalently lower than the
   actual target positions on the computer monitor Cv-effect). Both these
   patterns of systematic error increased in magnitude when a time delay
   was imposed between target presentation and initiation of movement. In
   addition, the presence of a stable visual cue in the vicinity of some
   targets imposed a novel pattern of systematic errors, including minimal
   errors near the cue and a tendency for other movement endpoints within
   the cue quadrant to err away from the cue location. A pattern of
   systematic errors similar to the oblique effect has already been
   reported in the literature and is attributed to the subject's
   conceptual categorization of space. Given the properties of the errors
   in the present work, we discuss the possibility that such conceptual
   effects could be reflected in a broad variety of visuomotor tasks. Our
   results also provide insight into the problem of reference frames used
   in the execution of these aiming movements. Thus. the oblique effect
   could reflect a hand-centered reference frame while the y-effect could
   reflect a body or eye-centered reference frame. The presence of the
   stable visual cue may impose an additional cue-centered (allocentric)
   reference frame.}},

Abstract = {{Art museums frequently remove old paintings from their original
   settings. In the process, the context of these works or art changes
   dramatically. Do museums then preserve works of art? To answer this
   question, I consider an imaginary painting, The Travels and
   Tribulations of Piero's Baptism of Christ, depicting the history of
   display of Piero della Francesca's Baptism of Christ. This example
   suggests that how Piero's painting is seen does depend upon tis
   setting. According to th Intentionalist, such changes in context have
   no real influence upon the meaning of Piero's painting, and
   consequently museums can be said to preserve works of art. According to
   the Skeptic, if such changes are drastic enough, we can no longer
   identify the picture's original meaning, and museums thus fail to
   preserve works of art. Skepticism deserves attention, for such varied
   influential commentators as Theodore Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Maurice
   Blanchot, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Martin Heidegger, Hans Sedlmayr, and Paul
   Valery hold this pessimistic view of museums. I develop the debate
   between the Intentionalist and the Skeptic. Ultimately skepticism is
   indefensible, I argue, because it fails to take account of the
   continuities in the history of art's display. But Intentionalism is
   also deficient because it is ahistorical. In presenting the history of
   Piero's painting. The Travels and Tribulations of Piero's Baptism of
   Christ shows that we can re-identify the original significance of
   Piero's work and the recognizable continuities that obtain through its
   changes. It thus makes sense to claim that at least in certain
   circumstances art museums can preserve works of art.}},

   concept of sovereignty. I discuss how what I call the ideology of
   sovereignty has hampered the development of IR theory. I suggest that

Journal = {{CESKA LITERATURA}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{476-483}},
Abstract = {{The thesis of the article is based on the question of the realization
   of the functional relation between the broad framework of poetic vision
   of the world and the narrower, regulating point of view determined by
   the writer's proclaimed endorsement of a system of firmly defined,
   dogmatically ideological models. The author bases his reflections on an
   analysis of space, time, and the topic of man in collections of verse
   by Jan Zahradnicek-Ziznive leto{[}A thirsty summer] (1935) and
   Pozdraveni slunci {[}Greeting the sun] (1937). It follows from the
   analysis that, rather than talking about the mutually conditioned
   effect of these two levels, of reality, it would be better to talk
   about a dialectic clash of fragments, each of which in a work of art
   represents part of its own reality, as if it were a special mix of
   fragments of a double kind-poetic truth and the truth of ideology.
   A literary text then means an entirely new form of reality. The poet,
   motivated by the experience of creative freedom, on the one hand, and
   by the voluntary acceptance of certain external ideological regulating
   points of view, on the other, introduces with greater or lesser success
   individual fragments of diverse layers of reality into a correlation
   that is intensified by the dominant effect of the aesthetic function.
   As the uniting individual he thus creates an imaginary whole that opens
   man up to the world, suggesting to the reader the idea of unity in
   diversity. At the same time, however, he does not mask the basic view
   that influences the birth of all modern verse-the increasing feeling
   that neither life nor the world can be integrated, something a poet
   like Zahradnicek understands as negative.}},

Abstract = {{In Conversational Realities (1993), John Shotter draws on social
   constructionist suppositions to conceptualize management as a
   rhetorically-responsive activity in which managers act as `practical
   authors' of their social realities (pp. 148-59). From this perspective,
   organizations are reworked from permanent, independent social
   structures to relational landscapes continually shifting from the
   imaginary to the imagined in interactive moments. Managing is seen as
   an embodied and situated dialogical activity in which managers act as
   authors of organizational realities through their conversations. In
   this article, I take as my central premise, the constitutive and
   metaphorical nature of language, and explore the practical, enacted
   aspects of Shotter's concept of authorship. Specifically, I suggest
   authorship may relate to how managers attempt to construct a sense of
   who they are, create a shared sense of features of their organizational
   landscape, and how they may move others to talk or act in different
   ways through their dialogical practices. I draw on research
   conversations with managers to explore how everyday poetic talk may be
   crucial to the process of constructing self, realities, and meaning.
   This `reconstruction' of management practice offers both a different
   way of thinking about managing and potential dialogical resources which
   may allow managers to author or construct organizational experiences in
   more deliberate ways.}},

Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Siegfried Kracauer's 1927 essay `Das Ornament der Masse' uses the
   Tiller Girls as an emblem of modernity, which he then proceeds to
   analyse. The stance he assumes vis-a-vis those women performers is,
   however, problematic: the essayist/narrator remains detached in the
   manner of a flaneur, who observes but remains passive. This becomes
   evident in an examination of Kracauer's narrative strategies in
   comparison with two short fictional texts, Robert Walser's `Ovation'
   and Franz Kafka's `Auf der Galerie'. Those two texts also deal, in
   different ways, with male observers, challenged by the female spectacle
   and failing to respond effectively. In `Das Ornament der Masse' the
   women's bodies are fetishised through narrative devices evoking
   cinematic techniques of fragmentation. This fetishisation results in a
   disavowal of the women's sexuality. Kracauer's imaginary attack on the
   dancer's bodily integrity reflects on the one hand his belief that the
   deconstruction of humanity is a necessary precondition for its progress
   to a state of true reason. On the other hand, however, it constitutes a
   defensive reaction to the `New Woman's' sexual liberation. Although it
   was frequently more seeming than real, this liberation compounded the
   attacks on male identity caused by the First World War, the Versailles
   Treaty and the inflation.}},

Abstract = {{Though several theories have been proposed to explain the manifestation
   of alter personality states in dissociative identity disorder (DID),
   the majority have failed to explain how alters develop over the life

   Expanding on Marmer (1991) and Putnam's (1995) concept of a
   developmental window of vulnerability for DID, this article proposes a
   three-stage model of alter personality formation, integrating theory
   and research on hypnotizability and imaginary companionship with
   perspectives on individuation and identity formation in adolescence.
   The author also speculates about possible courses of development
   leading to other trauma-related disorders. The author proposes that
   alters evolve out of childhood imaginary companions that merge with
   dissociative states of consciousness before individuating into distinct
   personality states during adolescence. Treatment considerations are
   raised emphasizing the need to diagnose DID early in its course of
   development before the alters have become invested in their
   separateness and begun fighting for control over the body.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{For many years there has been substantial urban political and economic
   interest in exploiting the use of cultural and aesthetic planning in
   order to improve the position of cities, within an expanding
   inter-urban competition. Built environments, places and spaces, have
   been regenerated in order to exploit their aesthetic, cultural, and
   historical significance so as to enhance commercial, consumption and
   public value, either for their citizens and/or tourists and capital. To
   date, discussions on urban planning have mostly ignored the fact that
   this `millennium urbanism' also requires a lot of `discursive
   planning', especially about the production of a place-identity and an
   urban imaginary. Discursive planning means staging the social meaning
   of urban space through texts, photographs, and visual signs. Aesthetic
   urban planning is not only about creating ambient surroundings, but
   also creating images, symbolic representations, and fantasies
   discursively using books and advertising, newspapers and television,
   research, and political agendas. These discursive practices are used to
   signify an identifiable and/or imaginary place-identity to form a sense
   of place or feeling of belonging to place. The article first discusses
   the theoretical relationship between discursive planning and
   representational space. The `how' of discursive planning will be
   exemplified using the Environmental City Programme in Oslo, Norway as a
   case-study. I conclude by discussing how this form of urban planning
   needs a reflexive and semiotic community.}},

Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{130}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{276-304}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{We develop a model for constructing quadratic objective functions in n
   target variables. At the input, a decision maker is asked a few simple
   questions about his ordinal preferences (comparing two-dimensional
   alternatives in terms `better','worse', `indifferent'). At the output,
   the model mathematically derives a quadratic objective function used to
   evaluate n-dimensional alternatives.
   Thus the model deals with some imaginary decisions (criteria
   aggregates) at the input, and disaggregates the decision maker's
   preference into partial criteria and their cross-correlations(=a
   quadratic objective function). Therefore, the model provides an
   approximation step which is next to the disaggregation of a preference
   into additively separable linear criteria with weight coefficients.
   The model is based on least squares fitting a quadratic indifference
   hypersurface (if n = 2, indifference curve) to several alternatives
   which are supposed to be equivalent in preference. The resulting
   ordinal preference is independent of the cardinal utility scale used in
   intermediate computations which implies that the model is ordinal. The
   monotonicity of the quadratic objective function is implemented by
   means of a finite number of linear constraints, so that the
   computational model is reduced to restricted least squares.
   In illustration, we construct a quadratic objective function of German
   economic policy in four target variables: inflation, unemployment, GNP
   growth, and increase in public debt. This objective function is used to
   evaluate the German economic development in 1980-1994.
   In another application, we construct a quadratic objective function of
   ski station customers. Then it is used to adjust prices of 10 ski
   stations to the South of Stuttgart.
   In Appendix A we provide an original fast algorithm for restricted
   least squares and quadratic programming used in the main model. (C)

Abstract = {{A teaching programme is reported in which critical thinking skills (in
   the sense of reasoned justification of arguments; see Kuhn, 1991, 1993)
   were taught. The principal aims of the study were to develop, implement
   and evaluate a programme for teaching evidence-based justification to
   vocational education students in Further Education colleges. Teaching
   was via modelling and peer-based critiquing exercises in the context of
   the students' project work. Eighty-four Further Education college
   students underwent a 10-session teaching intervention which dovetailed
   with their Additional Assessment integrative project work. Students
   took part in peer-based exercises in which they learned to critique
   imaginary examples of project outlines and plans, followed by similar
   peer-based critiquing of each others' proposed projects. Analysis of
   the students' dialogues with each other indicated that they had learned
   the importance of justifying arguments, and content analysis of their
   written work indicated that they engaged in justification of their
   arguments to a significantly greater degree than control groups.
   Several key variables in the dialogues correlated positively with
   justification in the written work, suggesting that the dialogue had
   impacted on the written work. However, justification tended to be of a
   weak kind (using anecdotes or experience-based generalisations), and

Abstract = {{Adolescents are thought to believe that others are always watching and
   evaluating them, and that they are special and unique, labeled the
   imaginary audience and the personal fable, respectively. These two
   constructs have been fixtures in textbooks on adolescent development,
   and have been offered as explanations for self-consciousness and
   risk-taking. However, their characterization of adolescent social
   cognition as biased has not been supported empirically, the measures
   used to assess them lack construct validity, and alternative
   explanations for both ideation patterns have not been explored. Despite
   these issues, the imaginary audience and personal fable constructs
   continue to be considered prototypical representations of social
   cognitive processes during adolescence. This paper (1) reviews
   theoretical models of the imaginary audience and the personal fable,
   and the empirical data pertaining to each model, (2) highlights
   problems surrounding the two most commonly used measures, and (3)
   outlines directions for future research, so that a better understanding
   of the imaginary audience and personal fable, and their roles in
   adolescent development, may be achieved.}},

   and technology out. We carried out ethnographic research in an HIV/AIDS
   Testing and Counseling Center (CTA) in northeastern Brazil, combining
   participant observation with epidemiological analyses and clinical
   survey. We found a high demand for free testing by low-risk clients,
   largely working and middle class, experiencing anxiety and complaining
   of AIDS-like symptoms. Most of the clients were sero-negative and many
   returned for a second and third testing. We understand this to be a new
   techno-cultural phenomenon and call it imaginary AIDS. Throughout this
   essay, we describe CTA's routine practices, place these practices in
   historical, political, economic and cross-cultural perspective, and
   analyze the subjective data we collected from the clients of our pilot
   study. We explore how clinical epidemiological expertise and HIV
   testing technology are integrated into new forms of bio-politics aimed
   at specific marketable and disease-free populations, and on the
   affective absorption of bio-technical truth and the engendering of a
   technoneurosis in this testing center.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports on a study that investigated the ways that

   questions for investigation were: how does the child contextualize the

   on the journal page reflect the children's experiences with other
   school texts? The study found that children recontextualized their
   understandings of the science investigation and phenomena by using
   three types of mental contexts that were reflected in their science
   journals: these contexts were imaginary, experienced, and investigative
   worlds. By drawing on these three worlds or internal contexts, the
   children were able to pull the external phenomenon into an internal
   context that was familiar to them. The child's construction of ideas
   about a current science experience as expressed on the journal page may
   reflect experiences with other conventional texts. In this study the
   children's representations of their imaginary, experienced and/or

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{715-735}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we discuss the apparent failure to couple together the
   constructs of `rurality' and `homelessness', and propose a critical
   deconstruction of this noncoupling. Three principal lines of arguments
   are employed. First, there are a range of physical and material reasons
   why rural and urban spaces have varying qualities for hiding or
   revealing homeless people, and why the embodied experiences of
   homelessness have varying geographies. Second, there are a series of
   obstacles that exist within the practices, thoughts, and discourses of
   rural dwellers themselves, which lead them to deny that homelessness
   exists in their place. Third, normalised conceptualisations about
   rurality and homelessness often serve to separate the two concepts, and
   contribute to the assumption that homelessness is an urban phenomenon,
   which is rendered invisible in rural space. In short, homelessness may
   be conceptualised as being `out-of-place' in the purified spaces of
   rurality, and the imaginary geographies of rurality and homelessness
   become transformed into everyday practices and actions relating to what
   people actually do in and about rural places. This critical
   deconstruction will be important for any attempts to recouple
   homelessness and rurality in the understandings and actions of
   policymakers.}},

Abstract = {{To touch on fiction is to touch on one of the sensitive spots of
   politics. For is not politics itself the place par excellence where
   fiction if found? This can be understood in various ways: there is the
   fiction which is a pretence or a deception, of course, but also fiction
   as the fable, narrative or story of a people, of a nation or of
   humanity. Better yet, does not fiction have a place at the heart of the
   political system, in laws and in power? Pascal stressed the sense in
   which fiction works from the inside towards obedience to the law, as
   well as its very status as law-as a mask for the violence which is at
   its origin. From another point of view, Hobbes attests how a juridical
   fiction-that of the fictitious man, the civic person-is at the heart of
   the institutional definition of the modern state in terms of
   representation ({''}fictitious,{''} here, not meaning false or unreal
   in any way). Politics appears as a place where there are multiple
   relationships between the real and the imaginary, as long as we are
   careful not to reduce this pair of notions unilaterally to those of
   true and false. Politics involves various types of relationship between
   the imaginary and the real: sharing, superimposition, transformation of
   the one into the other. In order to attempt to untie the multiple
   political links between the real and the imaginary, I shall first of
   all examine the different strata where the political problem of fiction
   arises. I shall then consider the way fiction works in the structure of
   power and the art of government with a view to answering the question,
   ``Can politics liberate itself from fiction?{''} or again, ``Is it
   possible to eradicate fiction from politics?{''} Two forms of fiction
   will be studies: fiction understood as illusion or deception, and
   fiction as transparency.}},

   constructed: what is to be lied about, what a lie is to consist of, how
   it is to be told, and whom it is to be told to, all reveal a social
   imaginary about who thinks what and what constitutes credibility.
   Secrets are negotiated: continual decisions about whom to tell, how
   much to tell, and whom not to tell describe social worlds, and the
   shape and weight of interactions therein. All of this makes lies and
   secrets extraordinarily rich historical sources. We might not see the
   truth distorted by a lie or the truth hidden by a secret, but we see
   the ideas and imaginings by which people disclose what should not be
   made public, and how they should carry out concealing one narrative
   with another. Such insights involve a step back from the project of
   social history, in which an inclusive social narrative is based on
   experience and individuals' ability to report it with some reliability,
   and suggests that historians need to look at social imaginings as ways
   to understand the ideas and concerns about which people lie and with
   which people construct new narratives that are not true. The study of
   secrets, however, links the study of social imaginings with the project
   of social history, as the valorization of information that results in
   the continual negotiation and renegotiation of secrets shows
   individuals and publics imagining the experiences labelled as secret
   because of the imagined power of a specific version of events.}},

Abstract = {{Edward Said's,orientalism', the globalization discourse and

   challenges to geographers who focus their research on the,Orient'.
   Having traditionally positioned themselves within an empirically
   orientated subdiscipline, scholars need to develop approaches which go
   beyond essentialism, methodological territorialism and scientific
   realism. This paper advances a perspective of dealing with cultural
   processes which starts from cultural hybridity as a radicalized way of
   viewing the social world and links this with an empirically manageable
   notion of culture through the introduction of transculturality as a
   heuristic intermediate concept. In this view culture is understood
   metaphorically as a daily practice of separating, differentiating and
   distancing, that is, as a diacritical practice. Syrian entrepreneurs
   are in this vein conceptualized as hybrid actors living in the
   betweenness of different worlds, the empirical emphasis being put on
   the entrepreneurial practice of symbolic and material,bordering' as
   well as imaginary and bodily territorialization. In the,global age' it
   is to a large extent through their diacritical practice that Syrian
   entrepreneurs contribute to the construction of the,Orient', a process
   which is considered to be a,consequence of modernity'.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This article analyses 178 essays written in April 1997, in which
   Siberian students (15-22-year-olds) described their understandings of
   Soviet and post-Soviet realities. The main change between the two
   regimes is perceived in these essays as the change in patterns of
   consumption. Moreover, as the essays indicate, the new Russian style of
   consumption, usually associated with the style of the new rich classes
   in Russia, finds its fullest representation in the figure of the `new
   Russian' man. The article suggests that students' attempts to envision
   unfamiliar patterns of wealthy consumption bring with them the
   reproduction of their own cultural dispositions and habits. Being
   unable to easily come up with adequate cultural signifiers that could
   homologically represent the distinctive economic location of the new
   rich, students chose to follow the path of quantitative rather than
   qualitative representation, expressing `the taste of luxury' in terms
   of the `taste of necessity'. Along with this subjective factor, that
   is, the students' own cultural dispositions, the prominence of the
   quantitative factor in their descriptions of the new Russian style of
   consumption is determined by the absence of a developed field of
   post-Soviet cultural production, which could have provided the new
   Russian style with distinctive status symbols.}},

Pages = {{417-438}},
Abstract = {{This study examines Rosa Montero's 1991 novel Temblor as an example of
   an emerging current in contemporary fiction that some critics are
   calling ``postmodern fantasy.{''} Specifically, these works combine the
   conventions of fantasy fiction with the destabilization of reality seen
   in postmodern texts to create a provocative and entertaining hybrid
   form. Montero's novel Temblor makes use of the traditional fantasy
   patterns of the adolescent initiation and the quest as narrative
   structuring devices. However, these motifs are not completed in the
   text, and their meaning giving properties break down due to this
   subversion of their forms. In addition, the dissolution of the
   structures of initiation and quest parallels the collapse of the
   ideological system of the novel(the imaginary religion of La Ley). The
   protagonist Agua Fria uncovers the artificiality of this religion only
   to discover simultaneously the power of perception and thought to
   create meaning and thereby control reality. The characters of the novel
   save their world from a devouring Fog of nothingness by reconceiving
   their understanding of the universe. Despite the constant threat of
   destruction from the Fog, the protagonist ultimately finds hope in the
   potential of a liberated reality, controlled only by human constructs
   of understanding. The fantasy form of this novel allows the author to
   project a physical manifestation of these metaphysical issues to
   provide greater clarity and more obvious representation of thematic
   ideas in the text. Finally, then, the novel takes fantasy structures
   and narrative patterns into a postmodern world of fluid reality and

   faster than persons operating rationally. Results indicated a
   significant effect for the priming condition with respect to the

   post-colonial and feminist critical practices are usefully integrated

   where we are located, it has been important to find our own voices with
   which to articulate our responses to these texts. Our own locus of
   experience, our `clearing in the bush' is something we have grown
   gradually to recognize and identify. It is hoped that we have been
   learning to appreciate the writings available to us without translating
   them into the discourse of the colonial, nor filling them up with our
   own particular meanings and the interpretations of a white feminist
   criticism. The post-colonial imaginary, and the discourses available to
   us have meshed with our own experiences as students and teacher,

   influenced more by people within their network(s) than by others; and

   One critical route which colonial commentators and authorities took to
   produce that knowledge was to measure women's proximity to the practice
   of prostitution, a means which permitted discussion and judgement of
   racialized sexualities as well as of proper models of feminine
   behaviour. This article will explore the ways in which the new
   sociology of the Victorian period, wielded in a colonial context,
   served to separate women through race-based ideas of sexual behaviour

   the levels of state-anxiety measured with the self-assessment

Abstract = {{The enormous success of the term ``discourse{''} in contemporary
   sociology and neighboring areas is very much due to the impact of
   Michael Foucault's Discourse Analysis, which aimed at a critical
   deconstruction of modernity through the concrete descriptions of
   strategically vital historical figures and their transformations.
   However, its speedy popularization is in itself a symptom that the
   notion of ``discourse,{''} whose critical force lay in its resistance
   to conceptuality and the conceptual impulse toward total perspective,
   has been hammered down to an inert flatness. This powerful drive for
   flattening subversion ( or rather flattening it out into a conceptual
   ``subversion{''}) - which also lurked in Foucault's own thought -
   indicates how difficult it is for us in contemporary society to
   discharge our own imagination for a transcendent viewpoint, whose
   omniscience is assumed to ensure the observation of society in its
   totality. By sketching out the present state of totality/omniscience in
   our sociological imagination, this essay seeks for a course to revive
   Discourse Analysis' potential capabilities - i.e., multiple

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Co-founder of the Cobra group (1948) and subsequently member of the
   Internationale Situationniste (1957-1960), Constant abandoned painting
   in 1956 and devoted himself to architecture and urban planning issues.
   This major work, New Babylon, a visionary architectural project for a
   future society, was contemporary with other imaginary utopian urban
   schemes drawn up in avant-garde circles internationally in the 1960s
   and the artist continued to develop it until 1974. Constant's
   ``situationist city{''} represented one of the earliest radical
   challenges to the institutionalized architecture of the post-war
   period. The aim was to transcend mere functionalism and envisage the
   urban milieu as an ``arca for participatory recreation,{''} a kind of
   labyrinth providing scope for diversion.
   Spatiovore, designed as a series of scale models, is as megastructure
   extending infinitely above the territorial space. Adopting the formal
   outline of a dislocated spiral, transparent shell-shaped structures are
   slung from pilotis. Spatiovore is a radical expression of the technical
   innovations of the period (tensile structures, hanging platforms,
   domes, etc.) combines into a comprehensive urban project.
   In 1965, Constant took up painting once again, via the intermediary of

Abstract = {{In the context of the publication of Agenda 2000 and the accelerated
   progress of the Irish economy from 1993, the Republic of Ireland's(1)
   position in relation to Structural Fund transfers generally, and
   qualification for Objective 1 status specifically, has undergone
   substantial revision since 1997. Against this backdrop, Ireland lodged
   a formal application with Eurostat in November 1998 to divide the
   country into two regions, one which would continue to qualify for
   Objective 1 funds, the other qualifying only for ``Objective 1 in
   transition{''} status. This ``regionalisation{''} strategy proved to
   generate substantial controversy both within and between the European
   Union (EU), the Irish government, and existing regional and local
   authorities and development agencies. These controversies were rooted
   in the need to transform the highly centralist scale division of the
   Irish state. At one level, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the
   significance of these conflicts in the light of recent debate in
   political geography regarding the conditions which serve to ground the
   EU's broader philosophy of a Europe of the Regions in particular ways,
   in particular places, at particular times. More generally, however, in
   respect to both its chosen methodology and findings, the paper hopes to
   contribute to the development of a process based approach to the
   contemporary (re)scaling of governance. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   feeling: as he evolves and changes from childhood to adulthood, he is
   bound to feel like an exile leaving places symbolical of himself. How
   to find the right house becomes a metaphysical quest; it reflects the
   problem of the flux of things and the permanence of the self. Walter
   Pater seems to suggest an answer to exile in the aesthetic vision of an
   idealised house built through centuries and embodying both the child's

Pages = {{2101-2113}},
Abstract = {{When components of a compound pattern stimulate different visual
   mechanisms, psychophysical performance typically improves by a small
   amount consistent with probability summation amongst independent
   detectors. Here we extend previous summation experiments by (i)
   plotting full psychometric functions; and (ii) using compound stimuli
   with components that varied in up to three stimulus dimensions: spatial
   frequency (1, 4, 5 or 11 c/deg), orientation (0 degrees, +/- 45
   degrees), and position. Stimulus components were isolated circular
   sine-phase patches of grating centred on up to four corners of an
   imaginary square surrounding a fixation-point. Combinations of
   component patches produced compound stimuli made from up to 16
   components that differed in various combinations of the three stimulus
   dimensions. Other than when the spatial frequency was 11 c/deg, results
   were well described using: (i) probabilistic summation of individual
   psychometric functions; (ii) the Quick pooling formula; and (iii) the
   signal detection analysis for 2IFC developed by Tyler and Chen (2000)
   {[}Signal detection theory in the 2AFC paradigm: attention, channel
   uncertainty and probability summation (under review)]. We conclude that
   in general, nonlinear spatial summation is consistent with
   probabilistic summation across independent detecting mechanisms that
   vary in spatial frequency (a range of at least 1-5 c/deg), orientation
   (a range of 90 degrees) and position (a range of at least 24 cycles at
   4 c/deg). In further experiments, results were found to be consistent
   with probability summation for pairs of orthogonally oriented step-edge
   stimuli and a matrix of randomly oriented 11 c/deg sine-wave patches.
   This casts doubt on the generality of a recent suggestion that local
   interactions between colinearly oriented detectors within a spatial
   neighbourhood of around four cycles may contribute to nonlinear spatial
   summation {[}Bonneh \& Sagi, 1998; Vision Research, 38 3541-3553]. (C)

Abstract = {{The main premise of this article is that globalization is both a
   universal phenomenon with common characteristic tendencies and a
   condition of plurality defined by the historical and geographical
   specificities of particular localities. This paradoxical point is
   explained in the theoretical context of the spatial configuration of
   globalization. The main concepts used to that end are Robertson's
   notion of glocalization, Castells' notion of polarization, Sassen's
   notion of global city and Appadurai's conception of imaginary worlds.
   The main objective is to elucidate, both in theory and in practice, a
   series of contradictions, ambiguities and irregularities that result
   from particular articulations of global and local developments. Turkey
   is used as a case study in order to analyze the practical implications
   of globalization(s) at both the national and local levels and at the
   level of neighborhoods. Borrowing from Appadurai's distinction between
   a locality and a neighborhood, the article argues that an empirical
   analysis of globalization(s) in neighborhoods helps us problematize the
   unsettling consequences of practical modes of glocalizations. Such
   problematization is necessary to understand the universal condition of
   globalization as an open-ended process that shapes and is shaped by
   particular cultural, political and spatial patterns.}},

Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{51}},

Abstract = {{Julia Kristeva's concept of ``herethics{''} posits a relationship
   between mother and child which leaves out, at least momentarily, the
   symbolic father of traditional psychoanalysis. In a similar way, Angela
   de Azevedo's Dicha y desdicha del juego y devocion de Ia Virgen appears
   to come dangerously close to heresy, as defined by the Counter
   Reformation, at certain moments in the play when the author presents
   the Virgin Mary not so much as the agent of God's symbolic law but as
   an embodiment of symbolic authority in her own right, independent of
   God the Father. Although the child in Kristeva's Oedipal scheme
   eventually submits to symbolic authority, Kristeva suggests that the
   mother's love plays a more vital role than the stern father's rivalry
   in the subject's transition from the imaginary to the symbolic.
   Similarly, Azevedo's play avoids heresy through sufficient mention of
   God the Father as the ultimate symbolic authority, yet it remains clear
   that the protagonist of the story would have maintained his psychotic
   structure and rejected God if not for the love and mercy of the Virgin,
   a surrogate for his deceased mother. Dicha y desdicha can be
   interpreted as a vindication of the maternal and a protest against the
   patriarchal domination of religious ideology, societal institutions,
   and the psychic formation of the subject.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Autism spectrum conditions are diagnosed on the basis of
   impaired imagination. The present study used a totally fret:
   story-telling method to assess if narratives produced by children with
   autism or Asperger Syndrome (AS) contained fewer imaginative events.
   Method: In Condition 1. children were offered an imaginary theme and
   asked to elaborate a story. In Condition 2, they were offered a
   reality-based theme with the same instructions. Comparison groups
   included 13 children with autism. 14 children with AS, 15 children with
   moderate learning difficulties (MLD), and 14 normally developing
   children. The non-autistic controls had a verbal mental age (VMA)
   either equivalent or lower than the autism and AS groups. Results: Both
   the children with autism and AS were less likely to introduce imaginary
   elements into their stories in Condition 2, though the children with AS
   were more able to produce imaginative narratives than children with
   autism in Condition 1. Conclusions: This study provides experimental
   evidence fur imaginative impairments in story-telling in children with
   autism spectrum conditions. These are discussed in terms of two
   cognitive theories: executive dysfunction and theory of mind.
   Limitations: In this study it was not possible to march the children

Abstract = {{This paper examines some of the ways in which the everyday is becoming
   connected into the world of finance, a process facilitated through
   so-called derivatives. The increasing use of derivatives is traced to
   the collapse of the Bretton Woods agreement and the ways in which
   innovative developments in financial engineering were used to overcome
   the uncertainties of interest rate, currency and price risks that grew
   apace from the early 1970s. We argue that these risks are not `more of
   the same'. They are qualitatively different and run deeper through the
   highly integrated financial markets of today. And, as later parts of
   the paper argue taking their cue from the works of Paul Virilio and
   Georg Simmel, notably the latter's Philosophy of Money, the manner in
   which these risks interact and the speed of their interaction suggest
   the emergence of new forms of money, a ne ir monetization of
   time-space. The paper then moves on to consider how the calculative
   practices that lie at the heart of derivatives involve a process of
   socialization of the understanding of the risks that new money forms
   are made to negotiate successfully. The `idea of money' - of what it is
   now supposed to be capable of doing with and across time-space - thus
   stems from a `new money imaginary'. The paper concludes by
   reemphasizing the reasons why, when understood through a reading of
   Virilio and Simmel, derivatives should be viewed as representing new
   forms of money.}},

   likely to remain unsure about the relative costs and benefits, and so
   less likely to agree to enter a randomised trial. In contrast, when the
   information provided reflected the current state of uncertainty which
   justified the trial, we predicted that people would be less likely to
   form a preference for one treatment arm over the other, and so more
   likely to agree to enter a trial. One hundred women aged 25-40 years
   were informed about HRT via a video and an information leaflet. For
   half the participants the information was Framed in a way which
   emphasised the current state of uncertainty about the relative costs
   and benefits of HRT, and in that respect it reflected the justification
   for a trial. This version was considered to be similar in style to
   information commonly provided to potential trial participants. For half
   the participants the same information was framed in a way which offered
   explicit numerical detail about currently known facts, and in that
   respect it was considered to be similar in style to information
   commonly available to doctors prior to a trial. Women learned as much
   about HRT in the two conditions, but women given the explicit versions
   were more likely (i) to hold a stronger view about whether or not they
   would take HRT (ratings wire not elicited from the first 30
   participants in this condition. N = 20, p < 0.05 1 tailed) and (ii) to
   refuse entry to the trial (N = 50, p < 0.05 2 tailed). Those who, given
   the explicit version, agreed rather than refused to enter the trial,
   scored higher on believing that others control their health (p < 0.01 2
   tailed). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to take a closer look at the status of translation, as a
   genre, in the French literary system of the 19th century, we have
   focused our study on a survey of the translation of Goethe's ballad
   Erlkonig, achieved between 1818 and 1860. Our questioning is about the
   modes of re-statement of the Foreign (its vision of the world, its
   imaginary world, its ``sense-forms{''}) about the fantasies which
   determine them, as well as the underlying stakes. In the first place,
   we are considering the process of annexion and reduction of Otherness
   to Sameness which characterizes the ``belles infideles{''} and we show
   how translation belongs to an hypertextuality involving imitation and
   adaptation, beside parody and fragment. The second part of our study is
   then centered on the problems linked to the transposition of the
   fantastic from one language and culture to another one. In a third
   part, we approach the topic of the relationship between the
   translations of the romantic ballad and the working out of the poem in
   prose. In the fourth and last part, we consider the 19th century
   translations of Erlkonig from the viewpoint of intercultural
   communication in order to define more precisely the mythical image of
   Germany which they carried and passed on to us.}},

   included was the 1995 Scale for Independent and Interdependent
   Construal of the Self by Kiuchi. More than hall of the participants

   assertive attitude as indicated by a higher score on independence on

   These results suggest that the Japanese in this sample are more likely
   to want to make an autonomous contribution to the psychiatric
   decision-making process and that less desire for information can be
   predicted by some demographic and personality factors.}},

Abstract = {{Thought Experiments (TEs) are reasoning processes that are based on
   `results' of an experiment carried out in thought. What is the validity
   of an experiment - that has not been actually executed - for knowledge
   about the physical world! What are the features that make it
   distinctive and how do we integrate it into learning environments to
   support such thought processes! This study suggests that a thought
   experiment draws on three epistemological resources: conceptual-logical
   inferences, visual imagery and bodily-motor experience. We start by
   stating how students' TEs are related to recent research on learning
   science and then proceed to describe the nature of TEs. The central
   part of the paper deals with cognitive theories and empirical examples
   of visual imagery and bodily imagery. It also deals with how these
   enable implicit knowledge about the world to be retrieved. Students may
   have, but are not aware of, such knowledge for it is hidden when
   learning is only based on format representations. We show that
   imagination is structured, goal-oriented, based on prior experiential
   imagery and internally coherent. Students can, for example, mentally
   rotate objects at constant velocity. Students can `zoom in and out' to
   inspect imaginary situations, transfer objects, predict paths of
   imaginary moving objects and imagine the impact of forces on mechanical
   systems. We show thar the TEs are powerful because of these
   capabilities. We further claim that these are not exploited by school
   learning environments and offer a first step towards understanding
   imagery in science learning.}},

Abstract = {{This paper argues that notions of the future and social change have
   been central to the sociological enterprise since its inception.
   However, sociology developed with the modern project and the rise of
   nation-states. This is reflected in the way that sociology has
   consistently taken for granted the geography of the nation-state as a
   basic organising principle for the understanding of social formations,
   producing `national' sociologies. Thus, while providing a view of
   Britain in 2025, this paper also asks questions about the imaginary
   that constitutes Britain and the ways in which it will be re-visioned
   as part of the `global cosmopolitan society: This re-visioning is not,
   however, the preserve of sociology and the paper elaborates popular
   imaginaries on the future of Britain. A recurring theme within visions
   of the future is the binary between utopias and dystopias, reframed in
   relation to the impact of new technologies and discussions of
   cyberspace. The paper examines the impact of these debates on the

   three different prioritization criteria (e.g., child, old patient, poor
   patient). Respondents were asked which one of each scenario pair they

   Results: Doctors prioritized young patients, severe disease, expensive
   treatments and posteriorized (negatively prioritized) demented or
   institutionalized patients, and patients having a self-caused disease.
   Children were strongly prioritized, even over serious diseases.
   Expensive treatments appeared to be favored by doctors, and this result

   that this essentially colonial set of relationships continues. We use
   this notion of coloniality to reconceptualize three social processes:
   (1) the construction of Puerto Ricans as colonial racialized subjects
   in the Euro-American imaginary; (2) the transformation of Dominicans
   into colonial immigrants in the New York Metropolitan Area, that is,
   the way Dominicans became ``Puerto Ricanized{''}; and (3) the

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Notorious for its opacity, John Ashbery's ``Description of a Masque{''}
   typifies both the avant-garde's unearthing of some odd precursor and
   its antipurist experiments with syncretism. It is a postmodernist
   re-vision of a Renaissance spectacle, where the traditional shifts in
   medium, backdrop, stage properties, cast, and action extend to elements
   imported from film and TV. The masque and the imaginary neomasque
   intersect-first, in their rich allusive poetics and, second, in their
   equal (if ultimately opposed) commitment to the endless conflict
   between the visual and the verbal media. However, Ashbery's text
   operates at a further remove from the evoked phenomena, because it
   translates the multimedia show into words: as ``Description,{''} it
   verbally re-presents the spectacular representation often
   re-re-presents what the masque theater itself re-presents from its
   multiple sources. This work-length engagement in interart transfers
   does not just enrich our idea of postmodern ekphrasis, or of the
   relations between ekphrstic and all-literary allusiveness, or of the
   yoking together of artistic movements across history. (E.g., the
   borrowing from an obscure de Chirico ekphrasis interposes an early,
   surrealistic avant-garde between the Renaissance masque and the
   postmodern writer.) It also proves crucial to making (narrative, hence
   also thematic) sense of the protean world and discourse world. Along
   one line, ``Description{''} thus narrates the metamorphoses of the two
   divine protagonists: the ever-adaptable Mercury and the resistant
   Mania. Each alludes simultaneously to more than on incarnation of the
   mythological figure, sometimes in more than one medium. And sequence
   joins forces with coexistence to variegate and disunify the self, so
   that on reappearance the figure looks either transformed altogether or
   a mixture of earlier and new properties, notable including costume. In
   either case, language here re-presents the changing features even when
   already unseen, to signify the dynamism of roles and images and past
   identities hidden in the visual present. Along a convergent line,
   ``Description{''} narrativizes the speaking observer of the
   performance- and the exactly when the changes in the imaginary scene
   are fastest. a close analysis reveals the measures taken here to weaken
   the visual effect, thereby assimilating the object of description to
   the belated process of enlightenment. To realize that ``the setting
   would go on evolving eternally{''} is to discover the existential
   principle behind the appearance of incessant, even meaningless change.
   Owing to language, insight outranks and reverses sight.}},

   a fast access method able to retrieve keys in order, so that the binary
   trie is often used as the indices of key search strategies such as trie
   hashing. However, the greater the number of the registered keys, the
   larger storage is required, as a result, the binary trie can not be
   stored into the main memory. In order to solve this problem, Jonge et
   al. proposed the method to represent the binary trie by a compact data
   structure, which is called the compact binary (CB) tree. The storage
   required for the CB tree is very small, to be sure, but it is debatable
   whether time and space efficiencies for CB tree can be improved. As for
   the time efficiency, searching and updating a key takes a lot of time
   in large key sets. This paper proposes a new hierarchical CB tree
   structure able to avoid the increase of the time-cost. As regards the
   space efficiency, in order to compress the binary trie into the CB
   tree, his method adopts the imaginary leaf, which is called a dummy
   leaf, for the nodes which have only one leaf. At this point, the number
   of dummy leaves has a bad influence on the space efficiency. This paper
   extends his tree representation for the Patricia binary trie and
   proposes the method for composing the CB tree without the dummy leaf.
   The theoretical and experimental results, using 50,000 Japanese nouns
   and 50,000 English words, show that this method provides faster access
   and more compact storage than the traditional method. Retrieval is
   18-20 times, the insertion is 11-13 times and the deletion is 4-6 times
   faster. This method, moreover, is able to generate 25-40\% smaller CB
   tree than the traditional method. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   constructive mode in forming any social integrations. A successful
   (post)modernization process based on endogene regional development
   results in the ability of metropolitan actors to revitalize the

   `metropolis' includes both basic metropolitan community (capital) and
   entire area of community (imaginary metropolis). The formation of the
   local community identity is the most important item on the list of
   revitalizing objectives of the Croatian periphery. Metropolitan
   obligations could be described as several development incentives:

   prominent in 7- to 9-year-olds, and then decreased in frequency in 10-
   to 12-year-olds. The developmental course of worry deviated from this
   pattern. This phenomenon was clearly more prevalent in older children
   (i.e., 7- to Ia-year-olds) than in younger children. Furthermore,
   although the frequency of certain types of fears, worries, and dreams
   were found to change across age groups (e.g, the prevalence of fears
   and scary dreams pertaining to imaginary creatures decreased with age,
   whereas worry about test performance increased with age), the top
   intense fears, worries, and scary dreams remained relatively unchanged
   across age levels. An examination of he origins of these common anxiety
   phenomena showed that for fears and scaly dreams, information was the
   most commonly reported pathway, whereas for worry, conditioning

Abstract = {{Despite differences between them, Gadamer and Habermas both argue that
   in order to understand the practices and beliefs of other cultures and

   imaginary `dialogue' with their subjects about ae nature of the world.
   Objectivity of understanding in their view consists not in prior
   suppression of our contemporary preconceptions and interests but in a
   process of actively seeking agreement (Verstandigung) with others over
   appropriate world-views and normative beliefs. This paper challenges
   Gadamer's and Habermas' thesis on three fronts. It argues that, (i) the
   notion of `dialogue' with past personages and abstract social
   totalities is not clear, even when qualified as `imaginary'; (ii) to
   derive normative Verstandigung from descriptive Verstehen is not
   conceptually well-founded, nor pertinent to the thematic goals of
   research; and (iii) however deeply interpreters remain tied to the
   culture of their upbringing, they are not thereby licensed to
   incorporate value-judgments into the research process. Rather than
   providing any methodological norms for research, dialogue ought best be
   seen as characterising certain moral and political responsibilities of
   scientists in relation to civil society and the public sphere.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the utility: of a ``vignette method{''} to assess mental
   competency for decision making on medical treatment and research
   participation. A vignette is a description of an imaginary situation in
   which the subject is asked to decide on a proposed treatment or on
   participation in research. His or her understanding of the situation
   and the quality of the reasoning underlying that choice are tested by a
   short series of questions. Subjects were participants in the Amsterdam
   Study of the Elderly (AMSTEL), a population-based study on cognitive
   decline and dementia. The sample consisted of elderly people (70-90
   years), who were cognitively intact (n = 176) or had a dementia
   syndrome (n = 64; mostly Alzheimer disease). Dementia was diagnosed
   using the Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the Elderly
   (CAMDEX) schedule. Two vignettes were used as competency assessment
   instruments. The answers to the vignette questions were summed to form
   a competency score. The reliability (internal consistency) of this
   score was 0.82 for both vignettes combined. After dichotomization into
   competent/incompetent (cutoff at the fifth centile of the control
   group), the agreement between the vignette method and a physician's
   judgment of competency was poor (kappa = 0.36) in the demented group.
   There was no agreement whatsoever when subjects with ``minimal
   dementia{''} (n = 14) were left out of this analysis (kappa = 0.04). As
   expected, mean competency scores declined with increasing dementia
   severity. A multiple regression analysis showed that mental competency
   as measured by the vignette method was determined mainly by recent
   memory, expressive language, and abstract thinking. In the control
   group the competency score was only slightly related to education (r =
   0.12) and verbal intelligence (r = 0.27). We conclude that the vignette
   method is a reliable and valid method for the assessment of mental
   competency in elderly people with cognitive decline. The vignette
   method is preferred over a physician's judgment, especially in patients
   with early dementia.}},

Abstract = {{The cost of medical care is constantly increasing. Therefore, ways of

   an elderly imaginary patient with moderate hypertension was given to 30
   family physicians and 30 hospital physicians together with a list of
   appropriate drugs (phase I). This was repeated as phase II except that
   for this stage the cost of the drugs was brought to the participants'
   attention. Knowing the cost of the drugs caused a decrease in
   prescription of the more expensive drugs for the younger patients; of
   60\% (family physicians) and 87\% (hospital physicians). For their
   elderly patients family physicians preferred the less expensive drugs
   at both phases. 25\% of the hospital doctors changed their preference
   towards less expensive drugs at phase II. For the younger patient, no
   correlation was found between the number of years of physicians'
   practice and the cost of the drugs chosen. For the elderly patient,
   physicians from both groups preferred less expensive drugs at phase II
   without any relation to their years of practice. The results of this
   study indicate that a knowledge of the price of the drugs may affect
   physicians' prescription decisions, a fact that may result in
   considerable saving by health providing organizations.}},

Abstract = {{Although much discussion of approaches to research concentrates on the
   differences between qualitative and quantitative models, some thought
   has been given to using both in single studies, mostly in program
   evaluation. One way out of the dilemma would be to adopt a
   non-foundationalist stance where the argument, no matter how
   constructed, would be subjected to debate and analysis by competent,
   interested spectators. This is the position taken by the authors as
   they each report on their analysis of data emanating from a single
   study, which explored preservice teachers' behaviors and perceptions as
   they assessed the work of an imaginary student named Chris. Finally, a
   summary and analysis are provided of the effectiveness of the mixed
   methods model as used in this study.}},

Journal = {{PSYCHIATRIE DE L ENFANT}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{269-298}},
Abstract = {{The donation of a child, a widely used and accepted cultural practice,
   most often within the enlarged family in black Africa, and in this
   case, more specifically in Senegal, makes it possible, when considered
   through an anthropological and psychological approach, to understand
   the other elaborations concerning the child and childhood better than
   those usually used by the psychologist. This circulation of children
   implies the existance of a donor, the mother or the father, and a
   recipient, a relative, who is gratified with a child who may resolve a
   problem of sterility or whose donation may relieve the family
   overburdened with children or it can be done for other reasons. To
   educate, as well as to be educated are difficult tests. After a
   description of behaviors, the subjective dimensions of this questioning
   will take into consideration the function of the child; at a fantasy
   level when the donation is made to a grandmother, at the symbolic level
   when the recipient is a newlywed, at the imaginary level when it is
   made to the child's namesake. The child who has been irrevocably
   donated knows his biological mother and father and his educators. The
   donation is not hidden but is in the realm of the unspoken. The child
   thus exposed is a chosen child, the object of a conflictual problem
   configuration of the primary and secondary parents' desires. This
   mobility of the child rests upon the denial of psychic suffering to the
   profit of groupe functionality. This study rs based on material from
   field observations.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{517-533}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines popular cultural constructions of the Scottish
   Highlands during the interwar period. Situating events within the
   literary and artistic context of the `Celtic Twilight', it traces the
   establishment, and subsequent links between, two pioneering `heritage'
   sites which used as their focus the `blackhouse', the vernacular form
   of habitation in the Highlands. These sites, created under the auspices
   of the National Trust for Scotland and the 1938 Glasgow Empire
   Exhibition, are understood as `official' expressions of a romanticized,
   imaginary geography heavily reliant on ideas of cultural authenticity
   and marginality. By considering aspects of the `Self/Other'
   representational dialectic and placing in question popular
   constructions of peripherality the paper considers how such projects,
   ostensibly motivated by remembrance and preservation, were also a
   highly selective means of national identification. Ultimately, the work
   demonstrates how the modern impulse to differentiate between, and
   thereby classify, distinctive cultural traditions and forms of
   knowledge facilitated an obvious Highland bias in what subsequently
   became Scotland's accepted historiography. (C) 1999 Academic Press.}},

Journal = {{ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{47-64}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In two resource-dilemma experiments participants were free to request
   an amount from an available resource whose size was a random variable
   with a uniform distribution either within a small interval (low
   resource uncertainty) or within a large interval (high resource
   uncertainty). In Experiment 1, one group of 20 undergraduates guessed
   the size of the resource as well as rated how confident they were. In
   three other groups equal numbers of undergraduates requested an amount
   which they would receive if it did not exceed the available resource.
   In one of these groups the outcome was only dependent on resource size,
   whereas in the remaining groups the outcome also depended on the
   requests by four other unfamiliar subjects who were either real or
   imaginary. Partially supporting a perceptual-bias explanation, subjects
   were in all groups found to overestimate or overharvest when resource
   uncertainty increased. Yet, an optimism or outcome-desirability bias
   explanation was maintained since the requests increased more with
   resource uncertainty than did the guesses whether or not the outcome
   depended on others requests. Experiment 2 employed another three groups
   of 20 undergraduates in a step-level resource-dilemma. Confirming the
   conclusion of Experiment 1. the results supported the
   outcome-desirability bias explanation but failed to support an
   egoism-bias explanation in showing that the overharvesting effect of
   resource uncertainty was not affected by social uncertainty. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The expression `information highways' is a misleading metaphor in cases
   where this term, borrowed from traditional topographical language,
   refers, in reality, to a complex topological contrivance composed of
   multiple threads bound together by different interconnection and
   commutation systems. The notion of `electronic distance' is related
   more to the question of access time for the user than to classical
   Euclidian space, and one of the principal characteristics of `highways'
   is precisely the fact that territorial hold is extremely discrete, if
   not absent. This is why territorial inscription of information highways
   incites us to revise certain traditional concepts of spatial analysis.
   The path suggested here invites the reader to take another look at
   classic notions of network and territory, enlightened by the technical
   and imaginary dimensions of electronic communications. This approach
   leads to an invitation to think, in the future, of `physical territory'
   and `virtual territory' as an ensemble.}},

Abstract = {{This article is about the impact of becoming Black on ESL, learning,

   that a group of French-speaking immigrant and refugee continental
   African youths who are attending an urban Franco-Ontarian high
   school;in southwestern Ontario, Canada, enters a social imaginary
   discursive space in which they are already imagined, constructed, and
   thus treated as Blacks by hegemonic discourses and groups. This
   imaginary is directly implicated in whom the students identify with
   (Black America), which in turn influences what and how they
   linguistically and culturally learn. They learn Black stylized English,
   which they access in hip-hop culture and rap lyrical and linguistic
   styles. This critical ethnography, conducted within an
   interdisciplinary framework, shows that ESL is neither neutral nor
   without its politics and pedagogy of desire and investment.}},
