Abstract = {{Organizations are increasingly dependent on various forms of
   partnerships to develop and to perform. These organizational
   partnerships may become potential learning arenas, broadening the
   learning capacities of the alliances involved. Thus far, the literature
   on learning in organizations has chiefly been concerned with how
   traditional and integrated organizations learn. Consequently a unit of
   analysis has not been developed to highlight how a collection of actors
   may learn and create value. :To address this issue, I will discuss how
   ``imaginary organizations{''} can protide an arena for actors to build
   knowledge on a joint basis. This type of partnership forms metasystems
   that integrate various partner organizations in order to share
   resources, pool competencies, and gain flexibility. As an empirical
   illustration, learning processes within the imaginary organization of
   Scandinavian PC Systems (SPCS) are described.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we provide a critical analysis of the concept of

   important theoretical insights, it is insufficiently developed as it
   stands to enable us to understand how men position themselves as
   gendered beings. In particular it offers a vague and imprecise account
   of the social psychological reproduction of male identities. We outline
   an alternative critical discursive psychology of masculinity. Drawing
   on data from interviews with a sample of men from a range of ages and
   from diverse occupational backgrounds, we delineate three distinctive,
   yet related, procedures or psyche-discursive practices, through which
   men construct themselves as masculine. The political implications of
   these discursive practices, as well as the broader implications of
   treating the psychological process of identification as a form of
   discursive accomplishment, are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Human and animal studies imply that sleep is a critical period for
   consolidation of recent memories. Whereas the majority of researchers
   focussed on the procedural learning, the present human study concerns
   how storing of spatial information and episodic memory are linked to
   sleep stages. Two city mazes, a simple and a complex one, were created
   by means of a computer program. Local aspects of these mazes appeared
   as street scenes on a TV-screen. Our subjects sat in front of the
   screen and manoeuvered through the maze by the help of a three-button
   PC mouse. Thus, each subject took a `mental walk' through an imaginary
   city. The task was to find various end-points and to find the way back
   to the starting point. Subjects of two experimental groups `walked'
   through either the simple or complex city maze for eight hours.
   Afterwards the subjects slept in our laboratory, where their sleep
   stages could be measured polygraphically. Subjects who had explored the
   simple maze showed considerable alteration in sleep architecture. They
   remained significantly longer in sleep Stage 2 than subjects who had
   explored the complex maze. Moreover, with successful orientation in the
   simple maze sleep stages occurred aperiodically, whereas walking
   through the complex maze was associated with sleep stages in accordance
   with ultradian cycles, as observed in a control group. Compared to
   subjects of the control group who had experienced neither maze, the
   subjects of both experimental groups had significantly enhanced EEG
   sleep spindle activities. Alteration in temporal architecture of sleep
   and selective prolongation of sleep Stage 2 following spatial
   orientation point to a functional linkage between cognitive mapping of
   space and sleep Stage 2 with enhanced EEG spindle activity.}},

   concerned with the ways in which processes and effects of economic and

   particular reference to the ways in which meanings that circulate in
   increasingly globalized media (such as television and the internet) are
   deployed in the construction of school knowledge. The author's
   particular interests are in the conceptual and methodological aspects
   of this research and, in this essay, an approach to conceptualizing
   globalization as a `transnational imaginary' in curriculum work is
   outlined. Two contextual issues that might complicate efforts are then
   briefly explored to inquire into local expressions of this imaginary.
   The issues on which this essay focus are (1) global perspectives that
   are already entrenched in many school subjects, and (2) popular
   expectations that the globalization of new information technologies

Abstract = {{The word nostalgia is a neologism conceived of by the Alsatian doctor
   Johannes Hofer to designate an illness caused by homesickness, and in
   which a depressive state is associated with severe psychological
   disorders that regularly result in the death of the subject unless the
   only treatment possible is available to him, i.e., repatriation. The
   history of concepts regarding and treatment of this morbid condition
   could in itself epitomise the developments in the field of medicine and
   of psychiatry during the last three centuries. Although the concept of
   `Heimweh' no longer meets scientific acceptance, it has nevertheless
   left its mark on our current theories and practices. Rather than
   perceiving nostalgia as a fearsome disease, the German romantic
   movement adopted `Sehnsucht' as its credo. The absence in space becomes
   loss in time, but the romantic version of nostalgia also signifies
   reconquest of a legendary past in a future that is no less imaginary.
   However, in this quest there is a real danger of confusing the domains
   of the Real, the Imaginary, and the Symbolic. The romantics rarely knew
   how to avoid this trap, just as was later the case with certain
   totalitarian nightmares in the twentieth century. There is,
   nevertheless, an appropriate application of the term nostalgia, which
   today may be considered as the metaphoric expression of a neurotic
   desire. (C) 1999 Elsevier, Paris.}},

   insides enclosed by those surfaces can completely merge. Two surfaces
   are relatable when their visible portions can be extended into occluded

   The preeminence attributed to the imaginary as the foundation both of

   the micro-social link, the construction of a dynamic system of
   representations or collective imaginary which is a system of
   interpretation, a principle of ordering combining the affective needs
   of individuals with the functional logic of organisations.
   Processes of construction and deconstruction are considered to reside
   within an inter-subjectivity envisaged in its link with practice, that
   is to say, via the need to transform the reality that in part founds
   being together, cooperation.
   These ideas lead to the question of intervention in the instituted

Abstract = {{This investigation studied the latencies of saccadic eye movements that
   were directed away from a target by a variable angular distance, which
   was given by instruction. Such a movement presumably requires an
   intentional, visuomotor mental rotation of the saccade vector,
   resulting in prolonged reaction times. From a study on the control of
   directed hand movements, it has been hypothesized that all visuomotor
   and visual mental rotation tasks share a common processing stage. We
   tested this hypothesis with a saccade task in which subjects shifted
   their gaze either towards (0 degrees, pro-saccade), or 30, 60, 90, 120,
   150, or 180 degrees (anti-saccade) away from a randomly cued position
   on an imaginary clock face. With four different cueing conditions,
   latencies increased monotonically with required gaze shift from 0-150
   degrees, thus exhibiting a mental rotation latency pattern. However, we
   also found anti-saccades faster than 150 degrees gaze shift and slower
   rotation speeds with peripheral cues than with central cues. Together
   with the overall shallower latency increase compared with previous
   findings with mental rotation tasks, these results cast doubt on the
   notion of a common, central processing mechanism for the different
   types of tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To describe two methodological approaches to surveying
   adolescents' sexual life which were combined within a national survey.
   Methods: The questionnaire was designed during a 5-day workshop. Ten
   adolescents played the roles of imaginary adolescents involved in
   different situations related to sexual life. The information obtained
   through the analysis of these role-plays was used to establish the
   sequence of the questions, their content and wording. The questionnaire
   was computerized so that it could be completed by the adolescents using
   laptop computers, Its arborescent structure, leading each respondent
   from one module to another, made possible the adjustment of the
   questions to each respondent's stage of development and type of sexual
   experience.
   Results: A total of 4283 teenagers (2075 girls and 2208 boys, and 4
   refusals) 16-20 years were included. Only 7.6\% did not fill in the
   whole questionnaire. By the age of 18 years, more than 50\% of boys and
   girls were sexually active. Half of sexually active teenagers have
   discussed contraception issue before engaging in their first
   intercourse, but much fewer (14-35\%) have discussed issues related to
   HIV transmission During their first sexual intercourse, the majority of
   the respondents used a condom (girls, 63\%; boys, 58\%) or condom plus
   oral contraception (girls, 11\%; boys, 17\%).
   Conclusion: Youth participation and role-play decrease the conceptual
   biases often associated with professionals' perceptions and bring tools
   enabling a better exploration of circumstances and negotiations
   surrounding the sexual encounter. The computerized questionnaire
   increases confidentiality, attractiveness, easy data collection, and,
   above all, adjustment of the questions to the respondent's level of
   experience. These methods could be more systematically used in surveys
   targeting sensitive issues related to adolescents' health. (C) Society

Abstract = {{In three experiments, we studied cueing effects of relational and
   item-specific information after enacted and non-enacted encoding of
   short sentences (e.g. lift the pen, fold the paper). In Experiment 1,
   all subjects were instructed at encoding to remember only the nouns of
   these sentences: half of the subjects were informed about the
   categorical nature of the nouns, whereas the other half were not. At
   retrieval, all subjects were given a free recall test and a cued recall
   test with the verb of each sentence as the cue. In Experiment 2, all
   subjects were instructed at encoding to remember the whole sentence; as
   in Experiment 1, half of the subjects were informed about the
   categorical nature of the nouns and half were not. At test, all
   subjects were given two cued recall tests, one categorical cue for each
   noun in the first test and one verb cue and one categorical cue for
   each noun in the second test. In Experiment 3, at encoding, all
   subjects were informed about the categorical nature of nouns and were
   instructed to remember the whole sentence. In this experiment, the
   actions were performed with imaginary objects; free recall and cued
   recall tests were given to different subjects. In all three
   experiments, there was a negative effect of intralist cueing with
   verbs. This finding is at odds with the Encoding Specificity Principle,
   which assumes facilitation of cueing at retrieval if the cues were
   encoded together with the to-be-remembered information at encoding.
   Also, the effect of intralist cueing was different after encoding with
   enactment than after encoding without enactment; this difference holds
   true for enactment with real objects but not for enactment with
   imaginary objects. Enactment increased both the relational and the
   item-specific cueing efficiency. The results are discussed in terms of
   encoding interference between cues and targets and between
   item-specific processing and relational processing. Enacted encoding is
   conceived as integrating episodic information both with respect to item
   specificity and relational aspects of the information.}},

   Recognition performance was better in condition SP than V. Moreover,
   recognition was better for bizarre than for ordinary phrases but only
   in condition V. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded

   negativity was found. This confirms the hypothesis that the SP
   advantage is due to the reactivation of motor information.
   Additionally, the later part of the recognition memory ERP effect was
   analysed. This effect reflects the overall familiarity of items in a
   recognition test. The amplitude increases with decreasing familiarity.
   In the present study, an enlarged amplitude was found for bizarre
   phrases in both conditions, V and SP. This suggests that recognition
   knowledge is present after SP and V. Moreover, according to the

Abstract = {{In this article, the authors use the example of a schoolteacher and

   discuss questions of biographical writing and the representation of

   neither be conceptualized gs a political leader or pioneer nor just as
   a nameless representative of a social group. In this way, they aim to
   challenge hidden paradigms in feminist history that make it difficult
   to represent types of biography that do not fit into conventional
   models of feminist agency. They propose to look at the archive that is
   the material background of biographical research as a strategic and
   symbolic space to discuss questions of memory and the ways in which
   past and present strategies of narrating and documenting women's lives
   are intertwined. They argue that collecting and storing `facts' always
   has strong imaginary aspects despite the realistic appeal of documents.
   By discussing two biographical models-the pioneer of women's education
   and the political activist-as two possible ways to see the biography of
   their protagonist, they draw attention to the dependency of any
   biography on the biographer's perspectives as well as the contingencies

   series of different - competing and sometimes complementary - imaginary

Month = {{SPR}},
Abstract = {{Strategy development requires that managers predict the future in an
   inherently uncertain world. Many mistakenly do so on the basis of
   perceived historical patterns that, according to recent scientific
   understanding of complex systems, do not have great predictive value.
   Complex systems consisting of many dynamically interacting parts are
   difficult and often impossible to predict because they exhibit
   punctuated equilibrium (periods of relative quiescence interspersed
   with episodes of dramatic change) and path dependence (small, random
   changes at one point in time that lead to radically different outcomes
   later). What, then, is a strategist to do?
   Beinhocker recommends cultivating and managing populations of multiple
   strategies that evolve over time, because the forces of evolution
   acting on a population of strategies make them more robust and
   adaptive. Because both biological evolution and business evolution are
   complex adaptive systems, to better understand business strategy,
   managers can employ a tool that scientists use to better understand
   biological evolution. An imaginary grid called a fitness landscape is
   an aid to comprehending how evolution increases the odds of survival in
   nature. In general, the rules for success in fitness landscapes also
   apply to business problems, though their specific application differs
   significantly by company and situation.
   The lessons of fitness landscapes offer an untraditional picture of
   what a company needs to develop a successful strategy. Because shifting
   an organization to this way of thinking about strategy is not easy, a
   company can take six actions to reinforce the robust, adaptive mind-set:
   Invest in a diversity of strategies.
   Evaluate strategies as real options that may open future possibilities,
   and remove biases that undervalue experimentation and flexibility.
   Diversify strategies along three dimensions time frame, risk, and
   relatedness to current business.
   Ensure that the strategies include sufficiently diverse initiatives in
   promising areas.
   Check that selection pressures on the firm's population of strategies
   reflect those operating on the population of strategies in the
   marketplace.
   Use venture capital performance metrics.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTION PSYCHIATRIQUE}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{601-614}},
Month = {{OCT-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The article develops the hypothesis according to which self-esteem is
   based on the ``pictogrammic{''} activity specific to the originary
   process, it is then possible to establish among patients having
   identity difficulties, a therapeutic approach which takes the dynamic
   dimension of the drive into account.
   The authors relate the establishment of a pattern concerning the
   restoration of the beyond-subject to the Freudian theory. They remind
   us of the operational value of the two following heterogeneous psychic
   strategies i.e. the activities of representation and escape such as
   they appear in Freud's dialectics through the process of pain reduction
   provoked in the infant by the tension of need. Then they go deeper into
   the idea that motility participates in a domain potentially able to
   register and keep traces of an irrepresentable relationship to the
   other. For them motility appears as the mode of expression of urgent
   need spreading libidinal capacity over the surface of an ``awakened{''}
   body.
   These studies open out onto the creation of the pattern of a space
   heterogeneous to the psyche yet sufficiently homogeneous to it to
   represent the interface with the unknown real. They tend to be
   validated by the results produced by a clinic of the ``link{''} which
   identifies and deals with the strength or the failures of self-esteem
   implied in ego depression.
   Starting from two clinical examples, the clinicians show how an
   activated originary process, which is neither of the imaginary nor
   symbolic domain, restores links beyond the subject which are yet the
   basis for the evidence of being on which the subject then builds his
   relationships and self-esteem. The study of Denise's case in the field
   of aging buttresses the argument of motility as a means of expression
   able to connect peacefully the strangeness of the real and the
   familiarity of the psychic apparatus, and consequently, to propose a
   foundation for the restoration of self-esteem. The study of Gregory's
   case, in the domain of high-level sports, allows to refer motility to
   the dynamic dimension of drive.}},

   civilisations and settlement societies. A cultural analysis, using the
   comparative and theoretical approach of socio-cultural anthropology,
   lends to the positing of a `field of forces' paradigm to orientate and
   position empirical instances of Indian diaspora globally. Three major
   issues affecting the overseas Indian communities are explored, namely,
   difference and translation, hybridity and creolisation, and policies of
   multiculturalism. The conclusion underscores factors such as the
   locationality of the analyst, rite general pacifist orientation of
   diaspora communities and slippage between the imaginary and the

Abstract = {{Objectives. It was hypothesized that people with persecutory delusions,
   such as depressed people, would experience difficulty when attempting
   to generate specific autobiographical memories.
   Design. 20 deluded participants, 20 depressed patients and 20 normal
   controls were compared on an autobiographical memory test.
   Methods. Participants attempted to recall memories to positive and
   negative cue words. Independent raters classified responses as
   specific, general, imaginary or unscorable. Over-general memories were
   further classified as extended or categorical.
   Results. Deluded participants recalled significantly more general
   (especially categorical) memories and fewer specific memories than the
   normal control subjects. Depressed participants showed little evidence
   of over-general memories, although they showed faster recall latencies
   to negative than to positive cues.
   Conclusions. People with paranoid delusions show information processing
   features similar to those previously reported in people with
   depression. The possible contribution of adverse experiences to
   over-general autobiographical recall is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the transgressive function of some Japanese
   women's magazines in the 1970s. It traces changes in the lives of
   Japanese women by focusing on the emergence of three new magazines that
   targeted young women from the late teens to the early 20s. It examines
   the contents of two magazines, An'an and Nan'no, launched at the
   beginning of the 1970s, which showed their readers how to get
   independent time and space away from the surveillance of parents. In
   1977 another magazine, More, was launched, targeting readers in their
   20s and 30s who were brought up reading An'an and Non'no. More shows
   the strong influence of feminism, and encouraged its readers to escape
   from the traditional women's life which was centred on marriage,
   husband and children. This article argues that the three magazines
   reflected the changes of Japanese women and reinforced those changes by
   providing knowledge, support for new identities and an imaginary
   community for readers. In this respect: it breaks with earlier feminist
   readings of girls' magazines which focused on their ideological
   function of reproducing patriarchy.}},

Abstract = {{Naito and Cole {[}1994, in Contributions to Mathematical Psychology:
   Psychology ics ann Methodology Eds G H Fischer and D Laming (New York:
   Springer)] provide a configuration which they describe as the Gravity
   Lens illusion. In this configuration, four small dots are presented in
   proximity to four large disks, and one is asked to compare the slope of
   an imaginary line which connects one pair of dots with the slope of a
   line which connects the other pair. In fact the slopes are the same, ie
   their axes are parallel, but because of the positioning of the large
   disks they appear to be at different orientations. Naito and Cole
   propose that the perceptual bias is analogous to the effects of gravity
   on the metrics of physical space, such that mental projections in the
   vicinity of a disk (or an open circle) are distorted just as the path
   of light is bent as it passes a massive body such as a star. Here we
   provide a simple test of this concept by having subjects judge
   alignments of dots which lie near tangents to a circle. Subjects were
   asked to project straight lines through pairs of stimulus dots,
   selecting and marking points in open space which were collinear with
   each pair. As would be predicted by the Gravity Lens theory, the
   locations selected by subjects were displaced from straight lines.
   However, the error magnitudes were substantially larger for judgments
   of dot pairs which had an oblique alignment, as compared with dot pairs
   which were aligned with a cardinal axis. This differential of effect as
   a function of stimulus orientation is not predicted by the gravity
   concept.}},

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{385-411}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Many young Somali refugees experience long premigration waits and a
   poorly delimited transition period in a succession of countries before
   reaching their final destination. During this difficult passage, a myth
   dealing with departure and exodus is collectively constructed, and it
   serves as a dynamic, mobilizing dream that orients individual
   strategies. This substitution of ``dream travel{''} for real travel
   during the transition period, especially if it is prolonged, may cause
   Somali youths to lose contact with reality and eventually to slide into
   madness. The authors' approach is based on three assumptions: (a) that
   pastoralism predisposes the Somali to value travel as a way of
   maturing, (b) that age-based peer groups create special migratory
   dynamics, and (c) that an ethic of solidarity involves many people in
   the adventure of a migrant youth. When trapped in an indefinite
   transition period, young men share What-chewing sessions during which
   they relate success stories and dreams of leaving. Many grow frustrated
   with the delay, and if their departure plans fall through, the ``dream
   trip{''} often becomes ``dream madness.{''} Actual cases illustrate how
   some young Somali get lost in their dreams. A young Somali's
   vulnerability is heightened when he extricates himself from the system
   of reciprocal obligations or when the liminal stage ends with the
   mourning of the impossible dream. In the universe of madness visited by
   some young Somali migrants, the boundaries between the real and the
   imaginary are poorly marked. The paper is based on fieldwork carried
   out in the Morn of Africa and in Canada, interviews with Somali
   immigrants and members of the community, and clinical psychiatric data
   collected in Montreal.}},

Journal = {{PATTERNS OF PREJUDICE}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-76}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's book, Hitler's Willing Executioners, provoked
   an unprecedented controversy in German society over the antisemitic
   origins of the Holocaust. The enormous publicity Goldhagen received in
   the German media, though, went along with almost unanimously hostile
   attacks against him and his work. Comparing the book's real content
   with the fierce rejection it received in the public sphere demonstrates
   that the nature of the debate is, first and foremost, an expression of
   the dynamics of Holocaust memory in present-day Germany. While
   Goldhagen's cultural-anthropological approach fails to grasp the
   complex origins of the Holocaust, he does legitimately focus on German
   political culture, antisemitism and `ordinary' perpetrators. However,
   the mass media, scholars and politicians in Germany reacted by first
   projecting on to him their own accusations of collective German guilt,
   and then branded him a `racist executioner'. In their portrait of
   Goldhagen's alleged anti-German hostility, many of the debate's actors
   slipped into anti-American as well as crypto-antisemitic prejudices.
   The Goldhagen debate demonstrates the psychodynamics of `secondary
   antisemitism' in Germany today: unmastered guilt feelings which are
   often split from the self and turned outwards against `imaginary
   accusers' who remind the public of the Nazi past. It should thus be
   interpreted in the context of recent efforts within German political
   culture to `normalize' the Nazi past, and to recreate a positive
   national identity. The debate can be viewed as both the expression and
   the encouragement of a transgenerational defensive aggression towards
   any critical memory of the Holocaust. In relation to the unwanted
   memories, the American Jewish scholar Goldhagen might embody an
   externalized conscience, projected on to Jews in particular for they
   are, by their very existence, representatives of the atrocious past.
   The effects of the Goldhagen debate in Germany are twofold. It has
   encouraged both a tendency among Germans to `overcome' the memory of
   the Holocaust as well as latent anti-Jewish prejudices which are still
   widely shared. Simultaneously, the media's instigation of a broad
   public debate on the Holocaust has provided a new opportunity for
   dealing with the legacy of Nazism.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between pretense and the child's theory of mind (ToM)
   has recently become a major research interest in developmental
   psychology. Over the preschool years, pantomime, or gestural
   representation, progresses from object substitution by body parts (BPO)
   to imaginary object (IO) gestures without environmental support. In the
   present study, the authors investigated whether pantomime is a form of
   pretense that is linked to ToM development. Forty-four children between
   age 3 and 4 were tested. An association between IO pantomime and ToM
   measured by false-belief and appearance-reality tasks was observed.
   Those children who passed the ToM tasks produced significantly more IO
   pantomimes than those who did not pass the tasks. The association
   continued to be significant even when age was partialed out. Modeling
   IO pantomimes to the children did not improve their performance. The
   results therefore suggest that the lack of IO pantomime in younger
   children is not the result of preference. Different reasons for the
   observed association between ToM and IO pantomime are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This ethnographic case study of a rural production co-op in the
   indigenous community of Santa Cruz (Oaxaca, Mexico) documents men's
   efforts to enlist women's participation in men's co-op projects. Over
   an eight-year period, men initiated a number of production projects,
   only to see them fail when women refused to participate. I use data
   from participant observation, surveys, and interviews to construct
   gendered time-geographies of agricultural and co-op project labor.
   These reveal the existence of labor crises, moments in the agricultural
   calendar when men's labor is insufficient to cover both household and
   co-op tasks. Men's attempts to mobilize women's labor power were met
   with women's counterstrategies of resistance. Ultimately, women
   established their own co-op production section (bakery) when men opted
   to incorporate them into the co-op as decision makers. The analysis
   suggests, first, that development project dynamics are fluid and,
   within specific circumstances, can enhance women's social and economic
   position vis-a-vis men. Second, participation is always partial and
   contingent and best examined within a context of ongoing negotiations.
   Lastly, poststructuralist time-geographies may contribute to
   development analysis when conceived as both material and discursive
   practices bound to geographic imaginaries.}},

Volume = {{86}},

Pages = {{70-93}},
Abstract = {{Several geographers have argued that the modem discipline is an
   intrinsically `European science', and many of them have drawn
   particular attention to the ways in which geographical knowledge was
   involved in projects of European colonialism and imperialism. These
   discussions have concentrated on instrumental reason: on the ways in
   which geography was involved in the day-to-day business of strategic
   planning and colonial administration through the production of maps,
   the compilation of resource inventories and population surveys, all of
   which shaped the empirical formation of the colonial order. But the
   Eurocentrism of modem geography has much deeper epistemological roots
   than these arguments imply. Drawing on the ideas of Michel Foucault and
   Edward Said, I suggest that geographical knowledge shaped the
   production of a colonial imaginary in a theoretical register through
   four discursive strategies: `absolutizing time and space', `exhibiting
   the world', `normalizing the subject', `abstracting culture and
   nature'. Each of these strategies has a long history (or genealogy),
   but it was in the post-Enlightenment world of the long nineteenth
   century that they came to be woven together into a particular tensile
   constellation of power, knowledge and geography. None of them were
   purely intellectual constructions: they all had vitally important
   practical consequences for the constitution of the colonial order of
   things. I suggest, too, that these strategies have continued, in
   displaced form, to shape the contemporary discipline of geography and
   our own colonial present.}},

   promise of humanities eternal renewal and was thus defined by a break
   with time and a contempt for tradition. In order that the republican
   regime might, after a century of hesitating, establish itself finally
   in France, the founding fathers of the Third Republic had to erase the
   revolutionary origines of the republican ideal, reintegrate all of the

   a much more complex, more problematic and also more pragmatic
   republican ideal, than that wich is magically invoked today.
   Retracing this itinerary is a manner of persuading ourselves that our

   Invisible. In each of these texts, Merleau-Ponty releases dreaming from
   the secondary status conventionally granted to it in relation to waking

   an authentic mode of experience. At the same time, he insists upon the
   interrelatedness of dreaming and waking by positing for both the lived
   body as a common ground that precludes dichotomization. Merleau-Ponty's
   elevation of the imaginary in general, and dreaming in particular, is
   especially relevant to contemporary psychology in its quest for

Abstract = {{Previous research has consistently shown that those on the political
   Right tend to prefer or use conventional or Stage 4 moral reasoning,
   while those on the political Left prefer principled or Stage 5
   reasoning (cf. Kohlberg, 1976). One interpretation of this finding is
   that developmental level of moral reasoning influences a person's
   political views, another that the moral `stages' associated with
   contrasting political positions are in fact contrasting politico-moral
   ideologies and that people choose the form of moral reasoning which
   best expresses their own political identity. We report four studies to
   test aspects of these alternatives. Participants (N = 50) in Study I
   rated moral arguments representing different stages as differentially
   relevant to people of varying political persuasions. In Study 2,
   participants (N = 106), assigned to play the role of constituency
   political parties (either Labour or Conservative) selecting candidates
   to represent their party, evaluated imaginary candidates differentially
   as a function of the kinds of moral arguments the candidates expressed.
   In Study 3 (N = 61), principled and particularly conventional moral
   arguments mere again found to express contrasting political identities.
   In Study 4 (N = 51) a manipulation of the salience of participants'
   political identity produced as predicted high correlations between
   moral reasoning scores and measures of political attitudes when
   political identity was salient but not when personal identity was
   salient. The findings overall, however, only partially support the view
   that political identity influences moral reasoning. We conclude that,
   although degree of preference for conventional or Stage 4 reasoning is
   a function of political identity, principled reasoning may be unrelated
   to political orientation. We also propose that these two forms of
   reasoning do not reflect successive developmental stages and that
   preference for one may be independent of preference for the other.}},

Abstract = {{The religious traditions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam are all
   today undergoing a transformation known generically as
   `fundamentalist'. Although this term is impossible any longer to define
   precisely, and although there are obvious differences between the
   movements to which the label is attached, numerous common features,
   including the original defining feature of fundamentalism-namely the
   idea of the inerrancy of a sacred text-remain. Together, these
   considerations justify an interpretation of contemporary religious
   transformations in a common framework of analysis, especially when
   account is taken of their global character. This paper develops such an
   interpretation by focusing on two aspects of the globalism of
   fundamentalist movements-their transnational reach and the role played
   by globalism in their imaginary projections across time and space. In
   addition the paper explains the movements' approaches to popular
   cultural traditions and to religious and sacred texts, and concludes by
   emphasising both their modernity and, through an account of their
   treatment of sexuality, the quasi-ethnic character of the multiple
   strategies of boundary maintenance which set them apart from other
   bearers of their own traditions and from the outside world generally.}},

Abstract = {{This paper starts with two approaches to risk: the sociological
   approach of Ulrich Beck and the `governmentality' account based on
   Michel Foucault's theses. Beck's approach is characterized as
   totalizing. realist, and relying on a uniform conception of risk.
   Moreover, his narrative of the emergence of risk society founders on
   the untenable binary, calculable/incalculable. Using Francois Ewald on
   social insurance, the paper argues that risk is better approached as a
   form of calculative rationality, a way of rendering the incalculable
   calculable. The governmental account allows us to analyse specific
   forms of risk rationality and technology, the types of agency and
   identity involved in practices of risk, and the political and social
   imaginaries to which these practices are linked. The governmental
   account, however, encounters difficulties in grasping the more general
   transformations of contemporary regimes of government. In this respect,
   Beck's notion of reflexivity is extremely useful. The paper then
   delineates various types of risk rationality (insurance,
   epidemiological, clinical, and case-management risk, and comprehensive
   risk management) and places them in an analytic of contemporary
   government. It concludes that one of the conditions of these new forms
   of government is the `governmentalisation of government'. Rather than
   `the death of the social', it is better to understand this analytic as
   charting a transformation of the liberal problematic of security and
   the emergence of `reflexive government'.}},

   Period-duration-dependent modulations of the amplitude were observed in

Abstract = {{Unilateral visuospatial neglect is now widely acknowledged to be a
   highly heterogeneous condition: The overt manifestations of visual
   neglect can vary as a function of task, spatial domain, and mode of
   response (at least). Double dissociations (sometimes of the strong
   form) have already been reported between most of the components of what
   was originally thought to be a relatively stable construct within the
   visual modality. Nonetheless, throughout successive fractionations of
   neglect, reported cases of bidirectional task-specific neglect after
   unilateral brain damage are rare. We now report two such cases. After
   right hemisphere stroke, the first patient reliably showed severe left
   neglect on cancellation but right neglect on line bisection. After left
   hemisphere stroke, the second case showed right neglect on cancellation
   but left neglect on line bisection. Extensive investigation of case 1
   confirmed our previous conjecture that the crucial distinction between
   these tasks lies in the presence or the absence of an overt target. In
   contrast to cancellation, line bisection demands the internal
   computation of the location of the ``target{''} (the midpoint),
   followed by executing a motor response toward the precise location of
   that ``imaginary{''} midpoint. The relative attentional and premotor
   contributions of the intact and damaged hemispheres to these forms of
   bidirectional neglect are also assessed. (C) 1998 Academic Press.}},

   attachment styles, rated their reactions to the relationship, and
   assessed the imaginary partner on 20 personality traits. Results
   provided support for the attachment-security hypothesis in two ways:
   (a) secure partners elicited more positive and less negative emotions

   more positive emotions than either avoidant type, and (b) for the

Abstract = {{Dr Ben Reitman was a social reformer, hobo, doctor, lover of Emma
   Goldman and anarchist activist in the United States in the late 19th
   and early 20th centuries. In 1910 he gave a lecture in New York titled
   ``Social Geography{''} in which he used a diagram picturing an
   imaginary peninsular, ocean and archipelago illustrating a series of
   points relating to the exclusion of a number of groups in Chicago
   during the early twentieth century. In this paper I consider the
   exclusion of Dr Reitman's unconventional knowledge of the excluded from
   mainstream social science. Remarkably, Reitman's Peninsular of
   Submerged Hope points to the poststructuralist cultural/social
   geography of the 1990s, emphasising marginalisation, amplifying
   marginal voices and pointing to the forces that produce marginalisation
   in the first place. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We conceive of time as a sequential order of real-world events, one
   event following another from past to present to future, This conception
   colours the way we speak of time ({''}we look forward to the time{''})
   and, as we show here, the way we process written statements referring
   to the temporal order of events, in real time. Terms such as `before'
   and `after' give us the linguistic freedom to express a series of
   events (real or imaginary) in any order. However, sentences that
   present events out of chronological order require additional
   discourse-level computation. Here we examine how and when these
   computations are carried out by contrasting brain potentials across two
   sentence types that differ only in their initial word ('After' X, Y
   versus `Before' X,Y). At sites on the left frontal scalp, the responses
   to `before' and `after' sentences diverge within 300 ms; the size of
   this difference increases over the course of the sentences and is
   correlated with individual working-memory spans. Thus, we show that
   there are immediate and lasting consequences for neural processing of
   the discourse implications of a single word on sentence comprehension.}},

Abstract = {{THIS article argues that both the private and public spheres must be
   taken into account when analyzing the development and everyday reality
   of the mentally ill. Private and public are two poles whose reciprocal
   relationship constitutes the form taken by a person's life. The
   interplay of both areas expresses how a person uses his thinking,
   feeling, and acting to relate to a real or imaginary audience. The
   psychosocial reality of a person is based on cooperation of the public
   and private selves. According to a central thesis of this essay, a loss
   of public presence leads in equal measure to a loss, rather than an
   increase, of private reality. An empirical study based on a sample of
   patients with chronic schizophrenia confirms this assumption by showing
   that such patients, under today's social conditions, develop lives
   characterized by a high degree of private reclusiveness. This is linked
   with an external and internal loss of life reality. Many patients,
   however, look for indirect and socially noncommittal forms of
   participating in public life without having to deny their private
   reality.}},

Abstract = {{This study had two interrelated purposes, namely, to determine if
   balance influences the way adults create visual displays and to subject
   theoretical notions of pictorial balance to experimental scrutiny.
   Adult volunteers made four designs, one each from circles, squares,
   rectangles, or leaves of different sizes. A. videotape recording of the
   development of each design from start to completion was used to create
   a digitized record of its image at 10\% intervals of the time taken for
   its completion. It was found that, regardless of element type or phase
   of construction, the center of a design was closely aligned with the
   geometric center of the pictorial field demonstrating the power of the
   center of a square held to function as an ``anchor{''} or balancing
   point about which a design's structural skeleton is organized. The
   ordering strategy used by participants to organize the elements of a
   composition about its balancing center was influenced by their shape
   characteristics and orientation potential. Structural weight was evenly
   distributed (balanced) about the center of the circle designs
   throughout their construction; an imaginary horizontal-vertical grid
   served as the structural skeleton for the creation of designs composed
   of squares and rectangles, and participants manipulated directionality
   of leaf elements to create an organized global design within the
   pictorial held. Finally, evidence of the visual salience of dynamic
   balance is provided by the finding that viewers were able to perceive
   subtle differences measured quantitatively in the distribution of
   physical weight about the axes of balanced compositions. Theoretical
   speculation concerning the nature of pictorial balance is discussed in
   light of the present findings. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   While completing the questionnaire, subjects made estimates of four
   timed intervals of 8 min., 22 sec. The treatment consisted of formal

   made bisection errors that deviated significantly in a direction

   second task ir. which subjects were given the midpoint and placed the
   two fins at the ends of an imaginary shaft (e.g., < . <, note: dot =

   read them as discourses of racialised femininity, which construct signs
   more real than the material circumstances and lived experiences through
   which they were produced and viewed. I offer a Marxist reading of these
   images as profoundly contradictory and unstable-embedded in modern
   historical and cultural processes rather than successfully fixing a
   clear and unchanging stereotypical view of North Africa and the
   racialised sexuality of black women's bodies. This should in no way be

Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{225-244}},

Abstract = {{Apart from its use as a manner adverb with full lexical meaning ('in a
   healthy, sensible way'), Latin sane is used as a discourse particle
   that is traditionally associated in grammars of Latin with a number of
   seemingly unconnected functions. In this paper I propose a more unified
   account, in which its various discourse functions are described on the
   basis of a three-stage analysis, which distinguishes between a
   relatively abstract basic meaning ('positive evaluation'), the domains
   or discourse levels to which this particle may pertain, and discourse
   pragmatic properties of the utterances in which sane is used. Special
   attention is devoted to the alleged use of sane as a concessive marker.
   I argue that, in the instances involved, sane is not in itself a
   concessive marker, but is used in the first part of a paratactic
   concessive constellation to mark the speaker's (restricted) agreement
   with a speech act that is attributed to a real or imaginary
   interlocutor.
   The paper starts with a more theoretical discussion of the approach to
   discourse particles on which my account of sane is based. The
   concluding section contains a number of diachronic observations on the
   development of the various discourse functions from each other and from
   the use of sane as a manner adverb.}},

   ``subjective{''} factors, a discursive analysis assumes a coherence
   between social and spatial arrangements that is derived in and through
   cultural meanings attached to specific places and has a material effect
   on their growth and decline. Both the conscious manipulation and slow
   accretion of images are important, as they are diffused by mass media
   and interpreted by ordinary men and women. Taking the decline of Coney
   Island and growth of Las Vegas as examples, a discursive analysis
   emphasizes how these public spaces of amusement represent low-class and
   high-class spaces, racialized spaces, and different eras of
   capitalism-culminating in a national rejection of urban populism for
   freewheeling speculation and privatization.}},

   seating preference among 49 seating positions in an imaginary

   positions. A factor analysis suggested that classroom seating space
   should be divided into four zones: rear, front, center, and sides. A
   multiple discriminant analysis suggested that the seating positions
   that students actually took reflected a four-zone structure. Classroom
   division based on the four-zone structure proved useful in

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{69-86}},
Abstract = {{An unfamiliar configuration lying in depth and viewed from a distance
   is typically seen as foreshortened. The hypothesis motivating this
   research was that a change in an observer's viewpoint even when the
   configuration is no longer visible induces an imaginal updating of the
   internal representation and thus reduces the degree of foreshortening.
   In experiment I, observers attempted to reproduce configurations
   defined by three small glowing balls on a table 2 m distant under
   conditions of darkness following `viewpoint change' instructions. In
   one condition, observers reproduced the continuously visible
   configuration using three other glowing balls on a nearer table while
   imagining standing at the distant table. In the other condition,
   observers viewed the configuration, it was then removed, and they
   walked in darkness to the far table and reproduced the configuration.
   Even though the observers received no additional information about the
   stimulus configuration in walking to the table, they were more accurate
   (less foreshortening) than in the other condition. In experiment 2,
   observers reproduced distant configurations on a nearer table more
   accurately when doing so from memory than when doing so while viewing
   the distant stimulus configuration. In experiment 3, observers
   performed both the real and imagined perspective change after
   memorizing the remote configuration. The results of the three
   experiments indicate that the continued visual presence of the target
   configuration impedes imaginary perspective-change performance and that
   an actual change in viewpoint does not increase reproduction accuracy
   substantially over that obtained with an imagined change in viewpoint.}},

   Both capture effects occur over a region that becomes wider with

   There was a relation between age and not representing the face

   Results are discussed from a psychoanalytic perspective. The

   elderly drawers could indicate a minimal age-related defect of the
   network which establishes that the real mouth and eyes are both

Abstract = {{The archaeology of Great Zimbabwe in southern Africa is well developed,
   but supporting evidence from other disciplines is scanty and often
   suspect. Consequently, the interpretation of many features of the city

   reconstruction of the site's cognitive archaeology relies upon
   misunderstood documents, dubious oral traditions, and inappropriate
   comparisons to arrive at a picture of a city that was essentially
   static in its use of space for at least two centuries. An alternative
   interpretation is offered that draws upon Shona historical and
   anthropological sources and, explicitly, imagination to show how
   political processes within a Shona dynasty could have affected the
   building of the central part of the city. This model does not pretend
   to explain every feature of the site, nor does it claim to be more than
   one of several possible models of its kind. Nevertheless, it
   corresponds far more closely to the workings of Shona society, as it is
   known to us from history, than Huffman's.}},

   begins to address the gap by focusing on the Ghanaian concert party in
   the volatile years from the end of World War II through the early years

   underwent profound transformations in form, content, and its modes of
   production and consumption. Through their geographic mobility and
   widespread popularity, concert parties participated first-hand in the
   transformation of public consciousness. Just as the popular press
   played a central role in the formation of European nationalism, so
   popular travelling theatre performed a pivotal role among a largely
   non-literate population during Ghana's transition from colonialism to
   modern nation state. This article interprets the generic conventions
   through which the concert party convened and constituted its new
   public. By deploying an eclectic range of formal techniques to
   dramatise everyday realities, concert parties became a primary
   integrative mechanism through which audiences negotiated a tumultuous

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The paper investigates the popularity of the Western genre in Germany
   during the 1930s as an integral part of the machinery of fantasy
   production that was both Nazi cinema and Nazi politics, While it
   deploys a critical concept of cinematic genres that relates generic
   conventions to the dynamics of spectatorial expectations, desires and
   investments, as well as specific imperatives of the entertainment
   industry, it traces the status of the cowboy within a (fascist) society
   that relied heavily on a constant mobilization of cultural resources
   for the sake of political legitimation. Nazi Westerns, the paper
   argues, indicate a comprehensive redefinition of the location of
   culture under the condition of fascism, while they at the same time
   remind us of the fact that Nazi culture was far less homogeneous and
   autochthon than its proponents in the past and most historiographers
   still today would like to suggest. In an analysis of Herbert Selpin's
   Water for Canitoga, the paper further shows how Nazi Westerns deploy
   the phallic rhetoric of the traditional Western, its idiom of
   masculinity and physical immediacy, in order to suggest surprising
   continuities between the nineteenth-century world of cowboys and the
   twentieth-century cosmos of engineers: German Westerns of the 1930s
   invite their spectators to imaginary voyages to the Far West that help
   revamp ideological formations of the nineteenth century - Wagner's
   romantic anti-capitalism - for the twentieth century only to avow and
   disavow simultaneously the technological faces of modernity. As they
   celebrate technological progress as a triumph of cultural forces, these
   Nazi Westerns render modern technological means as catalysts to explore
   the power of elemental forces, the rhythmic timelessness of pre-modern
   life; Nazi Westerns stage a complex protest against modernity by means
   of modernity's own tools of technological mediation and representation.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the article is to provide an analysis of the female
   subject constructed within the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act
   1990 (HFEA). More specifically, this figure is considered within the
   conceptual framework of the monstrous feminine. The article starts by
   briefly examining the association within the male imaginary of the
   female (particularly the maternal) and the monstrous. This association
   is illustrated through a consideration of fictional and medical
   narratives; it is asserted that the monstrous and the feminine share a
   cultural space characterized by both horror and fascination. Within
   contemporary discourse, it is seen that this association has become
   imbricated with more general anxieties regarding technology Examining
   the provisions, the article argues that the woman constructed through
   the provisions governing embryo experimentation and access to
   reproductive services is an object of horror and fascination. Most
   notably, it is in the exclusion of certain women from access to these
   technologies that the association between the monstrous and the
   feminine/maternal is most clearly evident. Although the author
   considers the monstrous within the regulation of New Reproductive
   Technologies, he does not imply that these technologies are purely
   disabling. With the focus on the issue of regulation, there is an
   implicit recognition of the possibilities that these technologies
   create.}},

   of the missing ten tribes. When applied to remote and relatively
   isolated indigenous populations, however, the European myth model of
   the lost tribe obscures differences in their histories and ignores
   their agency in current social interactions. In the Amazon lost tribes
   are the product of centuries of retreat and resistance against
   colonizers and nation states. In Melanesia disenfranchised groups
   contribute to the process through which they are designated `'lost

Abstract = {{Visual imagery is the invention or recreation of a perceptual
   experience in the absence of retinal input. The degree to which the
   same neural representations are involved in both visual imagery and
   visual perception is unclear. Previous studies have shown that visual
   imagery interferes with perception (Perky effect). We report here
   psychophysical data showing a direct facilitatory effect of visual
   imagery on visual perception. Using a lateral masking detection
   paradigm of a Gabor target, flanked by peripheral Gabor masks,
   observers performed imagery tasks that were preceded by perceptual,
   tasks. We found that both perceived and imaginary flanking masks can
   reduce contrast detection threshold. At short target-to-mask distances
   imagery induced a threshold reduction of 50\% as compared with
   perception, while at long target-to-mask distances imagery and
   perception had similar facilitatory effect. The imagery-induced
   facilitation was specific to the orientation of the stimulus, as well
   as to the eye used in the task. These data indicate the existence of a
   stimulus-specific short-term memory system that stores the sensory
   trace and enables reactivation of quasi-pictorial representations by
   top-down processes. We suggest that stimulus parameters dominate the
   imagery-induced facilitation at short target-to-mask distances, yet the
   top-down component contributes to the effect at long target-to-mask
   distances.}},

Abstract = {{A `new decentralization' is the leading idea in current enterprise
   management concepts and reorganization strategies. The consideration of

   and conflict constellations in enterprise management and on the shop
   floor, the paper discusses empirical findings on forms and consequences
   of decentralization strategies. It seems that the initiation of
   `internal markets' causes distinct changes in the relationship of
   central management and direct command structures in organizational
   subunits. But this does not mean `debureaucratization'. And the further

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. We aimed to examine the relationship between doctors'
   willingness to refer elderly patients for elective surgical operations
   and patients' age, comorbidity, institutionalization, living habits and
   signs of dementia.
   Method. A random selection of 837 medical doctors in Finland (response
   rate 56\%) received a postal questionnaire consisting of 18 vignettes,
   i.e. imaginary patient cases. Respondents were asked whether they would
   refer the patient on the vignette for elective surgical operation,
   treat the patient conservatively, or choose some other alternative. In
   the vignettes, the age of patients was randomly varied between 65 and
   85, at 5-year intervals, to provide eight different questionnaires, and
   each respondent obtained one of them.
   Results. The proportion of doctors willing to refer the patients for
   surgery was inversely related to the patients' age: in all the
   vignettes, doctors said they would refer fewer patients in the oldest
   age groups. Almost all the doctors claimed they would refer healthy,
   home-dwelling persons aged 65-70 years for operations. In the oldest
   age groups of patients, the doctors' willingness to refer was highest
   for cataract operations (69\%) and hip prosthesis operations (63\%),
   but only 18\% of doctors would refer such patients for coronary by-pass
   operations. Comorbidity and institutionalization were associated with
   fewer doctors referring the patients: the proportion of doctors willing
   to refer these patients was about half that of those willing to refer
   otherwise healthy and home-dwelling patients. Smoking by patients also
   decreased the proportions of doctors willing to refer, but moderate
   signs of dementia in an elderly patient with cataract were associated
   with only a slight decrease in referring.
   Conclusions. Doctors are less willing to refer old patients for
   elective surgery, but comorbidity, patients' lifestyle and
   institutionalization have a greater effect on referrals than age.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the significance of dreaming in Coleridge's

   compared poetry and dreaming on the basis that the imaginary objects of
   each are symbolic of a subjective self that is not explicitly present.
   In opposition to Wordsworth's `'sublime egotism,'' Coleridge's
   aesthetic emphasized the loss, rather than the (re)discovery of self
   and allowed for fragmentation and repetition rather than growth. It
   formed an alternative Romantic ideology-one capable of challenging the
   claims of that with which we are more familiar-an `'aesthetics of
   inachievement.'' The texts examined in the article are `'The Pains of
   Sleep,'' `'Kubla Khan,'' and `'Christabel,'' as well as numerous

Abstract = {{A visual stimulus consisting of two alternating images, presented with
   an intermediate blank phase between each image, each showing a pair of
   illuminated spots located at opposite corners of an imaginary
   rectangle, will evoke the percept of either a horizontal or a vertical
   apparent motion, called `stroboscopic alternative motion' (SAM).
   Psychological analyses have revealed that subjects can perceive only
   one of the two directions of motion at a time, favouring the direction
   along the shorter edge of the rectangle, but report spontaneous changes
   between the alternatives. If the stimulus configuration is gradually
   modified during stimulus presentation so that the preferred direction
   of motion changes from horizontal to vertical, or vice versa, subjects
   normally experience a corresponding change of their percept. This
   change, however, usually occurs with hysteresis, i.e. when the stimulus
   is significantly beyond its symmetric configuration. In this paper a
   microscopic neural model is presented which reproduces the main
   psychological findings. Its essential ingredients are simple motion
   detectors based on spatiotemporal receptive fields and an inhibition of
   detectors tuned to orthogonal directions of motion. The response of our
   network to the SAM stimulus is a high activity of either the detectors
   tuned to horizontal motion or those tuned to vertical motion,
   signalling a unique percept. In agreement with experimental studies,
   the preferred direction of motion is along the shorter edge of
   non-symmetrical stimuli and perceptual changes occur with hysteresis
   for a gradually changing stimulus configuration. We finish our argument
   by developing a mathematically tractable two-neuron model that captures
   the essentials of the above setup.}},

Abstract = {{Many critics view Irigaray's work as an extension or deconstruction of
   a Lacanian paradigm. Few actually analyse it as a direct challenge to
   Lacanian concepts of symbolic subjectivity, and the consequent,
   alternative framework this would envisage. This article discusses a
   possible beyond the phallus, in relation to mediating concepts of the
   female imaginary and symbolic within her work, and an understanding of
   the female imaginary and symbolic within different feminist
   interpretations of the maternal imaginary and symbolic, arguing that
   the imaginary is crucial in delineating a non-separatist cultural
   sublimation of female desire. Feminist revisions of the Oedipal by
   Jessica Benjamin and Kaja Silverman are examined in relation to the
   question of a maternal imaginary and symbolic. Irigaray objects to
   Silverman's privileging of a Lacanian concept of symbolic castration
   because it cannot negotiate between the literal relation to the body,
   and the metaphors and language of our cultural symbolic. Her female
   imaginary and symbolic provide this mediating link in direct challenge
   to the overly literal penis of Freud's castration complex and the
   essentially metaphorical nature of Lacan's phallus. Her mediation is
   related to the work of diverse psychoanalytic thinkers such as Andrew
   Samuels, Cornelius Castoriadis and Anthony Elliott. Returning to a
   feminist reading by Margaret Whitford, this article finally negates a
   Lacanian understanding of these structures and goes on to explore
   Irigaray's creative bodily imaginary, within two of her papers on
   analytic practice. Elaboration of a bodily and creative imaginary
   within the clinical setting can represent necessary mediation between
   real and symbolic and between the psyche and culture: this mediation is
   personified through the hysteric, not through the Oedipal Law of the
   Father, which is finally the key question in culturally locating female
   desire, thereby connecting the theory of psychoanalysis with practice
   and with history.}},

   adolescents aged 12 to 17 years were investigated to determine the
   incidence as well as the characteristics and functions of such
   fictitious individuals in this age group. Content analysis of data
   obtained from questionnaires revealed that the imaginary companion was
   similar to the writer in many aspects. The imaginary companion
   supported the adolescent during the process of developing his/her
   identity. The relative influence of self-concept, creativity,
   role-taking ability, coping behaviour, and egocentrism was then
   investigated using a hierarchical regression model. Three hypotheses
   were tested: (1) the deficit hypothesis, i.e. only adolescents with a
   deficit in social interaction create an imaginary companion, (2) the
   giftedness hypothesis, i.e. especially creative adolescents invent such
   a companion and (3) the egocentrism hypothesis, i.e. the construction
   of an imaginary companion is the result of perceived uniqueness and
   related to personal fable and imaginary audience behaviour.
   The results showed that the imaginary companion was not the result of
   an egocentric orientation, and by no means was a substitute for other
   trustworthy partners such as family members or friends. On the
   contrary, socially competent and creative adolescents with good coping
   abilities were particularly prone to create such a `'very special

   languages, for example. But the simple exercise of comparing an
   imaginary world of just one language, or one language family, with the
   existing world of some 6,000 languages makes it clear that linguistic
   diversity is a necessary condition for an understanding of both the
   truly elemental principles of human linguistic knowledge and the full
   range of possibilities permitted by them. The grammatical systems of
   `local' languages have been, and continue to be, crucial to the
   discipline. Examples from Hopi (North American) and Lardil (Australian)
   illustrate the thesis that linguistic diversity is necessary to
   understand even the linguistic features and principles involved in
   phenomena of an apparently accessible character - i.e., grammatical
   number and affixal concord. Syntactic examples from Navajo (North

Abstract = {{As early as the beginning of the XIXth C, Francois Magendie who greatly
   influenced Claude Bernard advocated the subversion of the Hippocratic
   tradition by medical discourse, This transfer of medicine has allowed
   prodigious progress in physiological and now biological field the
   passes by an objectivation of the symptom and a reduction of the
   suspended words of the subject to a mere clinical sign.
   Psychoanalytic discourse has been constituted by obeying the same
   scientific requirements: this starting from the experience of hypnosis
   of which Freud issued after having remarked on the `'mystical'' element
   it included. The `'talking cure'' underlines the unconscious symbolic
   value - subjective and polysemic - of language, its hold over the
   subject and the body; it opens an area of transference in which the
   subject may emerge through his speech and transform his relationship to
   pain into words.
   The present form of activity of Magendie's programme calls for a new
   correlation of these two forms of discourse, these two ways of
   perceiving and linking the Real, the Symbolic and the Imaginary.

   the therapy becomes a retraumatization with changing roles. The therapy
   also becomes a relationship trap if an offer of maturing later is made
   in the therapeutic relationship, but the therapist is unable to give
   any development incentives. A third relationship trap consists of the
   therapist having to really remain auxiliary ego and self object in
   order to be effective if he is not successful at making the early
   transfer. It is probably more effective and less dangerous if traumatic
   experiences are left in imaginary space and worked through with
   imaginative techniques. In the therapeutic relationship the
   communicative part of projective identification should be accepted and
   interpreted, but the conflict relief part should be tactfully and
   consistently rejected. Then the therapeutic relationship can become a

Abstract = {{The subject of this research is the role played by the morphological
   structure in the process of access to the lexicon. Although a lot of
   research has been conducted on this topic, experimental data on this
   role remains inconsistent. To appreciate the issue, the task of lexical
   decision is used with verbal material constituted by prefixed or
   pseudo-prefixed verbs as well as visually introduced pseudo-verbs. The
   nature of the radical (verb, noun or verb and noun) constitutes a
   specific factor yielding three types of prefixed structure (prefix -
   radical verb, prefix - radical noun, prefix - radical potentially noun
   or verb). Two types of pseudo-prefixed structures are studied In
   function of the nature of the pseudo-radical (existing or imaginary
   word). Subjects are submitted to two tests: a lexical decision test for
   the complete set of verbal material; a second test (to be taken
   subsequently) in which they are asked to check from a list the words
   they believe they have seen on the screen in the first test. Results
   indicate an effective morphological structure and that the processing
   of prefixed verbs is done according to the nature of the radical. Verbs
   with radicals that could be verbs and nouns are processed faster than
   those for which the radical is a verb. The second test also tends to
   indicate that the morphological structure is taken into account, and
   especially that the radical is activated at a certain point in the
   processing (certain radicals, if presented separately are checked as
   being present in the first test where only the prefixed items
   containing them were present). Results obtained with pseudo-verbs show
   an Important role played by the prefix in the identification of
   morphologically complex Items. These results only match partially the
   Taft \& Forster Model (1975). Illustrating the role played by the
   nature of the radical allows, to a certain degree, reconciling
   contradictory results in the literature. In fact, it is demonstrated
   that the different results from various experiences can be explained if
   this factor is taken into account. The number of prefixed items of each
   type (defined by the nature of the radical) can thus explain why
   certain studies reflect differences between morphologically simple and
   complex words and other discard them.}},

   in recall. In Experiments 2 and 3, we manipulated cue familiarity by
   priming the countries, lending to an increase in reported TOT states

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY}},
Year = {{1996}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. This study extends previous research that contrasted
   occupational forms with elderly persons living in institutions to
   include elderly women living independently. In addition to differences
   in number of repetitions elicited, the current study measured heart
   rate response and perceived rest period duration.
   Method. Forty-five women over the age of 65 years were randomly
   assigned to one of three occupational forms: materials based (kicking a
   balloon), imagery based (kicking an imaginary balloon), and rote
   exercise (performing a kicking movement without a balloon or imagery
   prompt). Subjects were instructed to perform the assigned
   lower-extremity movement until they fatigued and after a
   self-determined period of rest indicated when they felt able to do
   another set of movements. Dependent variables included number of
   repetitions of movement, heart rate (at baseline, at completion of
   movements, at end of rest period), duration of movement, and
   self-perceived rest period. Group means for each variable were compared
   using analyses of variance.
   Results. Groups showed no significant difference in baseline and
   demographic data. Subjects in the materials-based occupational form
   performed significantly more repetitions and required a significantly
   longer self-perceived rest period than subjects in the imagery-based
   and rote exercise forms. There were no significant differences among
   the groups for heart rate response. Duration of movement and number of
   repetitions variables were strongly correlated (r = .95), indicating
   lack of independence.
   Conclusions. The materials-based occupational form elicited a
   quantitatively different performance than the other forms. Given the
   relatively fuller experience (i.e., interaction with an object, clear
   objective) of the materials-based form, an occupational form that has
   added meaning for the person appears to result in enhanced performance
   when compared with forms that lack strong meaning and suggest more
   limited purposes.}},

Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{It has been largely overlooked that Henri Lefebvre in his book The
   Production of Space draws heavily upon Lacanian psychoanalytic accounts
   of the emergence of subjectivity in theorizing political relations.
   Lefebvre implicitly repudiates at the same time that he builds upon
   Lacan's distinctions between real, imaginary, and symbolic registers of
   subjectivity. For Lefebvre, Lacan's registers give primacy to visuality
   and heterosexualized familial dynamics while lived material, spatial,
   and political experience are incidental to subject formation and
   systems of meaning. Lefebvre transforms Lacan's registers by
   historicizing them in spatially dialectical terms, loosely replacing
   them with distinct forms of evolutionary spatialities which he calls
   natural, absolute, and abstract. In the process, he both subverts and
   reproduces Lacan's paternal-maternal (heterosexual) order. We hold that
   Lefebvre's critique provides powerful theoretical tools for
   understanding how alterity and signification are always and inevitably
   politically and materially mediated through corporealities and `space'.
   Nonetheless, Lefebvre can only work out his spatial dialectic of
   history in heterosexist terms: although he usefully identifies
   maternal-paternal metaphors in different Western social formations over
   time, he fails to interrogate directly the very heterosexuality that
   gives these metaphors their relational significance and force. In
   short, he brings us to the brink of a nonheterosexist domain, but never
   enters it. In this paper then, we outline the striking parallels in the
   theoretical frameworks of Lefebvre and Lacan in order to illustrate how
   both theorists focus on gender construction as the fundamental social
   process through which alterity is achieved. At the same time, we unpack
   the underlying phallocentrism and heterosexism that sustain their
   versions of alterity, subjectivity, and agency, in the process showing
   how Lefebvre deftly undermines the apolitical stance of Lacan. In
   conclusion, we strive to recuperate the crucial liberatory aspects of
   Lefebvre's project through considering how we might go on to dislocate
   received versions of capitalism and sexual difference.}},

Abstract = {{During the Middle Ages, the medium of exchange function of money was
   separate from the unit of account function. This has given rise to the
   misconception that the medieval pound was an `'abstract'' or
   `'imaginary'' unit of account whose purchasing power was independent of
   that of gold and silver coins. The joint behavior of the pound price of
   gold, the pound price of silver, and the silver-gold ratio in Basle
   between 1365 and 1429 cannot be reconciled with the notion that nominal
   values were autonomous. instead, the monetary system was based on a
   silver standard, supplemented by gold coins whose money of account
   values were determined by this silver standard. (C) 1996 Academic

Abstract = {{This article considers the ever-present nature of symbols in the human
   world and their specific nature in comparison with discursive signs,
   considering the `'use and harm (good and bad) of symbolic
   orientations'' in secular society. Symbols are dramatised images which
   contain deeply rooted inherited experience and recall forgotten
   practices for certain situations, reinforce the system of faith and
   other forms of collective identity. The article also looks al the
   symbolic quality of the subjects and activities of everyday life - from
   home and car to football. Those recreational activities, which fall
   within the symbolic rule of a limited field, seem to have an eminent
   civilising function. Symbols do however create an imaginary field of
   power, coherence, legitimacy, a certain order, a barrier against chaos,
   `'a sign of quality''. It is natural for revolutions to begin with the
   devaluing of accepted symbolic systems. Nationalism also represents a
   symbolic control of the field, since it creates a collective identity
   by using `'narrative symbols'', i.e. emotionally loaded experiences or,
   at times, mythical narratives, and of course inclusive codes which
   exclude acid stigmatise other groups. It is the staging of a sacred
   drama of redemption which is an expression of unity.
   With the help of mythical images, symbols can liberate areas tamed by
   civilisation, but at the same time they can represent a sign of the
   diversity of spaces and of human experience, and show how little
   self-evident are our routine orientations. It is clearly those traces
   of an archaic past in us all that allow people to break out with mass
   symbols; it is the `'forgotten language'' which in times of crisis
   breaks through the thin layer of the taught, the rational, the
   sublimated. At the same time even the most modern system looks to its
   past for confirmation, so that the struggles against seemingly
   regressive non-discursive signs can be counter-productive. Our frenetic
   horizontal movement must inevitably include something of the
   `'vertical'' nature of symbolic acts, which confirms the validity of
   one or the other type of social relationship. Without living examples
   the credibility of these relationships is of course itself only an
   uncertain symbol. Every sign is liable to falsification through life.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines a narrative, J.S. Mill's free speech paradigm,
   that establishes America as a place where a right to free speech is
   justified. This essay uses a genealogical approach to study how
   American practices of speech rights have appropriated this discourse.
   This approach shows how a western identity of free speech and progress
   and a backward non-West where speech is out of place have been produced
   by the Millian paradigm. These identities structure justified claims
   for a right of free speech. The Millian paradigm, I argue, creates a
   moral geography that maps ethical standing. This determines where a
   legitimate speech right is perceived, while defining a limit to such
   rights based upon the identify formation performed by this discourse.
   With the waning of Cold War geopolitical identities, I suggest that a
   reterritorialization of America's place within its global imaginary has
   renewed the importance of Mill's moral geography for contemporary
   understandings of speech rights and threats to such rights.}},

   During the imaginary lifting of the weights, the electromyographical
   activity (EMG) of both biceps brachii muscles were assessed. Imagery
   ability was measured with the Movement Imagery Questionnaire (MIQ) and
   another self-report rating scale. When response propositions were
   emphasized in the script, imaginary weight lifting resulted in greater
   muscle activity than when stimulus propositions were emphasized. During
   imagined lifting, EMG activity of the active arm was greater than that
   of the passive arm. In addition, in the active arm, a significant
   difference in EMG activity was found between 9 kg and 4.5 kg. It was
   concluded that Lang's model is also applicable to emotionally neutral

Abstract = {{This paper is written in such a way that the style reproduces the
   epistemological problems. Memories, sounds, and feelings are part of
   the analysis of subjective relations to Australian spaces, accordingly
   these are reproduced `ficto-critically'. The aesthetic is both
   nomadological and immaterial. Apprehensions of Australian space are
   constructed as movement through them. Accordingly the reader is taken
   on a journey from the backyard to the Outback, and it is explained why
   these two spaces have a certain homology. Anteriority, it is claimed,
   is a central category for a non-Aboriginal Australian imaginary. But
   some accounts of Aboriginal apprehensions of space are brought out for
   the purposes of contrast (for aboriginal people there is no `Outback').
   The textual status of these Aboriginal accounts is contingent upon the
   structures of their knowledge and ways of obtaining it. Instances of
   the author's `capture' on a tape recorder of stories by an Aboriginal
   woman, Bonnie Edwards, indicate the divergence of the form and purpose
   of her texts from the `textual suburbs' of theory that the author
   usually inhabits. As he leaves her country, his practical solution to
   the material weight of theory and the self-presence of narrative
   subjectivity is an immaterial one. He gets lost.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence of a culture of `tolerance' towards ethnic minorities in
   the West in the face of the practices of `ethnic cleansing' in Eastern
   Europe and of other more general practices of intolerance and
   extermination in parts of the Third World has led to a popular as well
   as a sometimes academic conception of `Western' and `Eastern'
   nationalisms essentialised into two radically different kinds of
   nationalism. In this paper I offer a critique of such a differentiation
   based on an examination of various practices of dealing with otherness
   in the process of nation building, particularly in Lebanon and
   Australia. I argue that practices of nation building, ranging from the
   promotion of ethnic cultures to mass ethnic killings, are guided by
   national imaginaries which, despite their empirical variety, are
   basically structured in the same way. This means, first, that such
   differences are better understood as the historical or contextual
   privileging of specific nationalist problematics grounded in this
   common national imaginary. Second, it means that within the nationalist
   imaginary that guides them there is a space in which, in given
   circumstances, the practitioners of valorisation and tolerance can turn
   into practitioners of mass killings and vice versa without them turning
   into a radically different kind of nationalists. Far from being
   specific to an `Eastern' nationalism, the logic of extermination is
   inherent to any form of nation building today.}},

Journal = {{KYKLOS}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{251-272}},
Abstract = {{The mathematization of economics has, almost without exception,
   proceeded along pathways delineated by the Formalists and the
   Bourbakians. The methodological underpinnings have been provided by
   deductivism. Recent developments in logic, the foundations of
   mathematics and the philosophy of science suggest new possibilities for
   the formalization of economics along recursion theoretic and inductive
   lines. In this essay I explore, counterfactually, alternative paths for
   the mathematization of economics on the basis of these new visions. By
   choosing particular nodes in an imaginary decision tree depicting the
   development of mathematical economics, I ask whether a recursion
   theoretic formalism of economics could have led to alternative, more
   interesting and interdisciplinary, histories. My conclusion is
   unambiguously positive in at least one important sense: often, at such
   crucial nodes, economic concepts have been forced to conform to a
   narrow mathematical and methodological formalism simply because the
   appropriate alternatives have been absent; or, when present, unknown to
   the practitioners. A broader awareness of theoretical technologies and
   a deeper understanding of the development of mathematical economics is
   not only necessary; it is also eminently feasible when viewed in this
   particular counterfactual mode. Examples from core areas in economic
   theory - consumer and production theory, games and existence proofs -
   are harnessed to extract the above messages.}},

Abstract = {{Thirty female caregivers of elderly people living in the Australian

   and the results of using the vignette methodology to identify coping
   strategies among the 30 female caregivers. The caregivers' answers to
   the imaginary situations were found to be related to their real life

   fulfilling their caregiving responsibility, and reported reaching a
   breaking point after which they were not eager to continue. The

Journal = {{PERCEPTION}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{569-581}},
Abstract = {{Open-loop reaching for locations within figural illusions was measured
   in three experiments. The experiments differed with respect to whether
   subjects were provided a visible target toward which to direct their
   reaching or were required to form a mental representation of the
   intended target. In the first experiment, subjects' reaching errors for
   vertices of a Muller-Lyer figure were similar to those for a
   nonillusory control stimulus. In experiment 2, subjects' errors while
   reaching to the imaginary bisector of the Judd illusion were consistent
   with the presence of an illusion of bisector location. However, when a
   bisector line was added to the Judd figure, reaching errors were
   similar to those obtained with a control figure. In experiment 3,
   subjects' open-loop reaching at the perceived midpoint of a triangle
   was biased toward its illusory perceptual midpoint. When a mark was
   placed at the midpoint between a vertex and the opposite side, reaching
   errors were similar to those obtained with a control figure. The
   results of the experiments indicate that hand-eye coordination is
   biased in the direction of illusions of bisector location only when no
   target is present at the intended goal of the reaching response and
   subjects are required instead to form a mental image of the target.
   Under these conditions, reaching responses appear to utilize the
   spatial map of the visual system, and are influenced by figural
   illusions of bisector location. The present data can be understood
   without invoking the notion of visual- motor dissociation.}},

   Design - The method consisted of a set of 24 paired scenarios, which
   were imaginary patient cases, each containing three different ethical
   indicators randomly selected from a list of indicators (for example,
   child, rich patient, severe disease etc.). The scenarios were grouped
   into 12 random pairs and the procedure was repeated four times,
   resulting in 12 scenario pairs arranged randomly in five different sets.
   Survey - This method was tested with four groups of subjects (n=8,
   n=47, n=104 and n=36).
   Results - Children and patients with a severe disease were prioritised
   in all groups. The aged, patients with a mild disease and patients with
   a self-acquired disease were negatively prioritised in all groups. Pear
   or rich patients were prioritised in some groups but negatively
   prioritised nt others.
   Conclusions - The validity and reliability of this method are good and
   it is suitable for investigating attitudes towards medical priorisation.}},

   mothers can be categorized into three groups based on their behavior.
   Active inducers are most likely to put their child in danger, as early
   as the first year of life. Doctor addicts project their hypochondria on
   their child, insistently asking physicians to confirm the child's
   imaginary disease. Help seekers exaggerate their child's symptoms and
   often feel that they are unable to cope with their child's needs.
   Psychotherapy has little effect on maternal behavior. Steps should be
   taken to protect the child The health status of siblings should be
   evaluated, and the family should receive long-term followup.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Despite considerable top-down pressure and numerous professional body
   initiatives, a persistent shortfall in published nursing research has
   been noted. Numerous explanations have been put forward to account for
   this which implicate issues at both the individual/psychological and
   the structural/organizational levels. However, one area which has not
   yet been properly addressed is that of role appropriateness, in that
   research skills and activities may be construed as being incompatible
   with the traditional role expectations and values of nursing. To test
   this proposition, two groups of qualified nurses were each required to
   consider six descriptors of an imaginary nurse following the paradigm
   of Asch's (1946) seminal Central Trait Theory study. Of these, five
   adjectives were identical for both groups, but the sixth descriptor was
   manipulated, such that one group received `good clinician' and the
   other `good researcher'. The subjects then had to rate this imaginary
   nurse along each of 15 bipolar traits. The groups' ratings were
   compared using a series of unrelated t-tests. The results indicated
   that if a nurse was described as a good researcher she or he was also
   assumed to be more ambitious, a poorer communicator, less kind,
   stronger, more logical, more controlled, more confident, less popular,
   more ruthless, more rational and more analytical than if she or he was
   described as a good clinician. These findings suggest that the
   qualities attributed to a good nurse are dissonant with those
   attributed to a good researcher and, in this way, the mutual
   incompatibility of each role's requirements may serve as an obstacle to
   the development of research with nursing.}},

Journal = {{SOCIOLOGY-THE JOURNAL OF THE BRITISH SOCIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{253-277}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The winter of discontent continues to exert a powerful hold over the
   British political imaginary. It acts as a discursive key to a
   collective mythology seemingly appealed to, and conjured, in each wave
   of industrial unrest, in each hint of political turmoil and, until
   recently, whenever the election of a Labour Government looked credible.
   In this paper I consider the rhetorical strategies and linguistic
   devices deployed by the tabloid media in the narration of the events of
   the winter of 1978-79. I argue for an interpretation of the winter of
   discontent as a moment of state crisis. By crisis however I do not
   refer to the mere accumulation of contradictions but rather to a moment
   of transition, a moment of decisive intervention. Within such a
   framework, the winter of discontent emerges as a strategic moment in
   the transformation of the British state, and perhaps the key moment in
   the pre-history of Thatcherism. For, as I hope to demonstrate, the
   initial appeal of the New Right was premised upon its ability to offer
   a convincing construction of the winter of discontent as symptomatic of
   a more fundamental crisis of the state. In such a moment of crisis, a
   particular type of decisive intervention was called for. In this
   discursive construction of crisis the New Right proved itself capable
   of changing, if not the hearts and minds of the electorate, then
   certainly the predominant perceptions of the political context. It
   recruited subjects to its vision of the necessary response to the
   crisis of a monolithic state besieged by the trade unions. This was
   perhaps the only truly hegemonic moment of Thatcherism. It occurred
   well before Mrs Thatcher entered Number 10. It is thus not surprising
   that one of the most enduring and distinctive legacies of Thatcherism
   has been the new political lexicon of crisis, siege and subterfuge born
   of the winter of discontent.}},

Abstract = {{I believe that there is no intrinsic moral difference between killing
   and letting die. That is, there is no difference that depends solely on
   the distinction between an act and an omission. I also believe that we
   can reasonably establish this thesis by appeal to the Bare Difference
   Argument. The form of this argument involves considering two imaginary
   cases in which there are no morally relevant differences present, save
   the bare difference that one is a care of killing and one a case of
   letting die. But in the pair of cases under consideration this bare
   difference makes no moral difference. Hence it cannot be that the bare
   difference between killing and letting die is in itself a morally
   important difference.
   Winston Nesbitt has recently argued that the Bare Difference Argument
   fails because `'the examples produced typically possess a feature which
   makes their use in this context illegitimate, and that when modified to
   remove this feature, they Provide support for the view which they were
   designed to undermine''. I argue that Nesbitt misunderstands the logic

   become typical of all post-socialist countries. A model case is the
   former Soviet Union, where over the `'perestroika'' years the
   population was deprived of the meaning of their previous lives by the
   devaluation of all past social goals, In recent years the population
   was deprived of all of their life-long savings, While on the personal
   level the process brings about a great deal of human resignation slid
   tragedy, it also brings about anomie. disorientation frustration among
   different strata and generations. These processes threatens to have
   far-reaching implications, such as the spread of nationwide apathy,
   disbelief, loss of direction, desperation, and political absenteeism.
   Resistance against dissignification can be achieved through different
   productive and nonproductive practices. By productive we mean real
   activities aimed at the recovery or improvement of one's former social
   status. By nonproductive we mean those aimed at the cultivation of
   imaginary links with a substitute unreal world. In this respect we
   concentrate on fatalisation and transcendisation as compensatory
   practices at an individual level. For general uses the relevant
   practice is the creation of myths. A massive turn to myths in
   contemporary post-socialist countries contributes to the formation of a
   past-oriented attitude inimical to reform and societal transformation.}},

Title = {{Primate striate and prestriate cortical neurons during discrimination
   .1. Simultaneous temporal encoding of information about color and
   pattern}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{481-495}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. We recorded the responses of neurons in cortical areas V1, V2, and
   V4 to a set of 36 colored patterns while monkeys discriminated among
   the stimuli on the basis of their color or their pattern. In the
   discrimination task a colored square or a black and white pattern was
   presented foveally as a cue stimulus. The monkey was required to
   choose, by making a saccade, which of three peripheral targets had the
   same property as the cue. One of the peripheral targets was centered on
   the receptive field of the neuron, and the other two were positioned at
   equally distant points around the circumference of an imaginary circle
   centered on the cue and passing through the receptive field.
   2. An examination of the responses to the stimuli showed that there was
   a complex interaction between the effects of color and of pattern on
   the neuronal responses. Because of these interactions, we tested
   sensitivity to color and pattern by sorting the responses to all
   stimuli according to the color or pattern of the stimulus. We found
   that the number of spikes in the responses was affected by only one or
   the other of the stimulus parameters, but that the temporal
   distribution of spikes was affected by both stimulus parameters. We
   quantified the relative sensitivities of each neuron to color and
   pattern by dividing the amount of information the neuron transmitted
   about color by the amount of information the neuron transmitted about
   pattern. The distributions of information ratios assuming a spike count
   code were broad, indicating that many neurons were sensitive to only
   one stimulus parameter or the other. In contrast, the distributions of
   information ratios assuming a waveform code were narrow and centered
   near 1.0, indicating nearly equal sensitivities to both stimulus
   parameters.
   3. In our initial experiments, it appeared that the color or pattern
   used as the cue for the discrimination task affected the responses of
   many neurons to stimuli on the receptive field. To determine whether
   the cue effect was due to simple visual interactions or to the
   cognitive requirements of the discrimination task, we performed a
   control experiment in which the cue was turned on 80 ms after the
   peripheral stimuli. For many of the neurons in the control experiment,
   an effect related to the cue appeared in the response before the cue
   had been turned on. Thus the effect we observed must have been due to
   visual interactions with the distracter targets, even though these were
   outside the neuron's classically defined receptive field.
   4. We compared the rate at which color and pattern information
   developed in the response over time assuming either a spike count or a
   waveform code. The spike count code gained more of its information in
   the first 20 ms of the response than did the waveform code, but
   thereafter the information carried by the spike count code developed
   more slowly and reached a lower asymptote than did the information
   carried by the waveform code.
   5. The waveform codes carried nearly equal amounts of information about
   color and pattern, but the messages about these two parameters did not
   develop at the same rate in all areas. The messages about color and
   pattern developed at the same rate in area V1, but messages about color
   developed more slowly than did the messages about pattern in areas V2
   and V4.
   6. These results offer a neurophysiological basis for both the
   psychological separateness of color and pattern, and the binding of
   color and pattern into a unified percept. We propose that the
   separateness of color and form arises not by virtue of their being
   encoded by different populations of neurons, but by virtue of their
   being encoded by separable waveform codes in the responses of single
   neurons, We propose that the binding of color and form occurs by virtue
   of their codes being multiplexed on the same neurons.}},

   opposition is between the `'creole'' style, engendered by the sons of
   Italian and Spanish immigrants, and the `'British'' style, practised by
   the descendants of British immigrants. The `'creole'' style lies on
   elegance and improvisation while the `'British'' expresses force and
   discipline. These discrepant values are presented as alternative styles
   reflecting different masculine virtues. The meaning of the cult of the
   `'pibe'' (a young boy) as creator, in the empty spaces of the city of
   Buenos Aires, of the `'creole'' style is also presented The article
   shows that the imaginary of Argentinian football is not independent of
   the intellectual concerns in the contemporary literary and political
   worlds. Popular and elite culture belong to the same intellectual
   arena. From a given lecture or Borges and the `'gauchesca'' literature,
   the article elaborates on the creation of contradictory masculinities

Abstract = {{Introduction: Optimum treatment for aircrew who have developed anxiety

   However, standardized flight profiles are not found in the literature.
   In this study, a method of desensitization flying, which may increase
   the probability of a return to productive flying, was devised and
   assessed. Method: Seven aircrew were referred for flying
   desensitization. Behavioral therapy (relaxation training, imaginary
   flying, and thought switching) was usually continued by the Medical
   Officer (Pilot) (MOP). These aircrewmen flew 2-16 sorties in the RAF
   IAM Hawk or Hunter aircraft with the MOP. Each flight was structured
   with three purposes: to approach by increments the flight conditions in
   each victim's anxiety hierarchy, to regulate the amount of low
   workload, anxiety-vulnerable time during each sortie, and to practice
   relaxation techniques in the air. Results: In all referred aircrewmen,
   anxiety was controllable in flight at IAM. Somatic signs diminished and
   no sortie was terminated early. All returned to operational flying.
   Anxiety recurred in one fast jet pilot while flying solo, and in one
   navigator, both of whom requested a change to transports. A transport
   pilot had recurrent uncontrollable anxiety at high altitude and is
   grounded. At 9-24 months follow-up, 5/7 were flying comfortably with
   rare, controllable anxiety. We conclude that actual exposure to flying
   is usually necessary for aircrew to recover from anxiety associated

Abstract = {{When gray and black alternating bars in white and black alternating
   grids were observed through a stereoscope, the visual system detects an
   imaginary rectangle of gray bars which appeared in the rear or front
   stereoscopic plane. The rectangle in the rear stereoscopic plane looked
   amodally completed and opaque dark gray. The dark gray was caused by
   the contrast with the white background. The rectangle in the front
   stereoscopic plane looked modally completed, translucent and blackish.
   The black was caused by the assimilation to the black grids in the rear
   stereoscopic plane. When the rectangle was moved to and fro
   horizontally, both rear and front rectangles looked more vivid and
   blacker. These results indicate that both contrast and assimilation are
   closely related to object perception in the real world, reminiscent of
   Kanizsa's modal and amodal completions. When a focal area is admitted
   as a thing, two phenomena tend to occur; one is called contrast, which
   exaggerates the difference between the thing and the not-thing, while
   the other is called assimilation, which neglects any differences within
   the thing.}},

   Increased awareness of Freud's biases, both in his early tendency to
   pressure patients into believing that they were victims of abuse and in
   his later tendency to regard certain types of incest allegations as

   the contemporary post-modern condition. The emergence and dissemination
   of heretical discourses displace the apolitical self-evidence and

   Firstly, the erosion of modern political discourse suggests that
   history, progress, state, nation and society have lost their charisma
   of self-evidence. These cornerstones of modern political experience are
   disclosed as socially constructed imaginary totalisation. Secondly, the
   representation of gender as a social construct reveals the falsehood of
   essential human experience. Gender, as an example of otherness, shows
   that the construction of experience is closely linked to a
   power/knowledge nexus. Thirdly, Nietzsche's metaphor of language as a
   prison allows the role of discursive practices in the constitution of
   experience to be outlined. This article argues for a
   non-foundationalist perspective, which grasps the mediated character of
   experience, and accepts the condition of uncertainty produced by the

   position that in the easy acceptance of a stereotyped cultural
   construction, mainstream America has come to little knowledge or

   or their discrete identities. For the mass market, the Indian is either
   the Vanishing Race of Edward Curtis's photographs or the savage of the

Abstract = {{In this paper we outline a cognitive model of Obsessive-Compulsive
   Disorder (OCD) which proposes that the core belief of OCD evolves
   through a series of illogical inferences. These faulty inference
   processes involve inferring the plausibility of events on the basis of
   irrelevant associations, dismissing actual evidence on the grounds of
   going beyond surface reality to a deeper reality, and finally inferring
   that a completely fictional narrative is a remote probability. A
   therapy aimed specifically at changing these inference processes is
   illustrated with case examples of OCD clients who had not benefited
   from conventional behavior therapy. The inference based approach (IBA)
   complements existing cognitive-behavioral therapy but suggests that in
   certain cases, the conventional cognitive therapy view of OCD beliefs
   as exaggerated fears of remote possibilities may actually reinforce the
   obsessional belief since even remote events are real. The IBA on the
   contrary suggests that an important goal in therapy is to highlight
   this confusion found in OCD between imagination and reality and
   illuminate for the OCD client how their compulsions, far from
   reassuring them about a remote possibility, actually take them further
   away from reality and reinforce their imaginary doubt.}},

   conditions: a) minimal alerting (counting backwards during rotation);
   b) physical arousal (induced by exertion prior to rotation); c) mental
   arousal (induced by performance of stressful mental tasks during
   rotation). Both the physical and mental tasks induced a significant
   increase in heart rate compared with the alerting condition. The
   maximum SPV of the nystagmus induced by rotation was significantly
   greater during performance of the mental task than in the other two

   experience of both self- and object representations in the

   inconsistency between the national broadcast standard for indecency and
   the local community standard for obscenity. Indecency cases from the

   categories, examined and analyzed in terms of the proposed framework.
   The regulatory framework proposed in this paper operates not only to
   update the formulation of the concept of indecency but also to foster
   consistency. By dispensing with an imaginary and often erratic national
   broadcast standard, the model allows local communities to judge what is
   indecent in accordance with the norms of the community.}},

Abstract = {{Pain is a personal event, yet much research concerns how people compare
   their pain to the pain of others.  In this study, we assessed the
   relative impact of positive and negative versions of normative,
   ipsative, and imaginary standards on the experience of pain under
   laboratory conditions.  We expected that self-referent standards
   (ipsative, imaginary) would have more influence than other-referent
   standards (normative) on the evaluation of pain.  The effect of
   manipulating these standards on changes in subjects' tolerance times
   and pain intensity ratings from Trial 1 to Trial 2 was evaluated.  The
   normative and ipsative standards significantly affected pain intensity
   ratings and the ipsative standard significantly affected tolerance
   times.  These results do not support our intuitions about the relative
   importance of self-referent standards over other-referent standards in
   evaluating the experience of pain.  The assessment and treatment
   implications of the enigmatic influence of normative information on
   pain is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{THIS paper presents a feminist-psychoanalytic analysis of the
   contemporary debate over the veracity of memories of sexual abuse
   recovered in treatment. Clinical discourse is currently divided between
   those who argue that recovered memories are veridical accounts of
   sexual trauma and those who claim that many therapists are creating
   memories of abuse in their patients. I present here an analysis of the
   debate on recovered memory and of the social dynamics underlying it,
   and discuss how these dynamics have shaped clinical practice. In
   exploring the clinical issues raised by the debate, I reassess Freud's
   abandonment of seduction theory and explore some of the problematic
   issues in separating fantasy and memory in female psychosexual
   development. Conflictual aspects of female development are situated in
   an analysis of patriarchal social relationships that continue to
   mediate feminine experience. I argue that the jettisoning of the
   concept of fantasy in much of the clinical literature on sexual abuse
   has contributed to a reification of memory - that is, as `'true'' or
   `'false'' and a sacrifice of complexity in the clinical elaboration of
   women's abuse experiences. In reclaiming the concept of fantasy, I
   explore a range of meanings located between the imaginary and the
   `'real'' suggested by female narratives of sexual abuse.}},

Abstract = {{The history of many industries can be characterized as a series of

   unexpectedly long old age of optical photolithographic alignment
   technology to suggest that this belief is probably incorrect. 
   Unexpected changes in user needs and in the capabilities of component
   and complementary technologies permitted optical photolithography to
   dramatically exceed its `natural' limits.  However belief in the
   existence of a predictable life cycle had important implications for
   the evolution of the technology since it provided a framework within
   which industry participants embedded tacitly held, largely unexamined
   knowledge about the ways in which user needs and component and
   complementary technologies were likely to evolve.  These results lend
   support to those that have argued that it is important to explore both
   the social context of a technology and the dynamics of the technology

Abstract = {{It can be argued that imaginary practice and physical practice are

   imaginary practice in motor learning and motor memory are similar in
   both direction and size to those resulting from physical practice. The
   purpose of the present study was to provide additional support for this
   finding using a retroactive interference paradigm. Sixty participants
   were required to practise performing a simple motor task that was to be
   completed in a criterion time of 700 ms. They then were randomly
   assigned to one of six groups. These groups differed in the amount and
   type of interpolated practice they experienced. One physical practice
   group attended one session of interpolated activity involving physical
   practice of another motor task. The other physical practice group
   participated in two such sessions. One imagery group attended a single
   session entailing imaginary practice of the same interpolated motor
   task, while the other imagery group had two such sessions. A fifth
   group experienced a combination of physical practice and rest periods
   for two interpolated sessions. A control group did not experience any
   interpolated activity sessions. Following the interpolated activity
   sessions, all groups were given a retention/reacquisition test on the
   original motor task. Imaginary and physical practice during the
   interpolated activity sessions caused similar interference effects on
   retention/reacquisition. All groups showed greater deviation from the
   criterion movement time (700 ms) during the retention test than the
   control group, and these deviations were in the expected direction
   given the nature of the interpolated motor task.}},

Abstract = {{The ongoing progress in neonatal intensive care is modifying the
   psychic context of prematurity for all the partners, infants as well as
   parents and physicians. Comfort and prognosis of preterm infants have
   much improved. Since newborns under 24 weeks of gestational age are now
   surviving, they spend approximately half the duration of pregnancy out
   of the maternal uterus. All the psychological issues of such an early
   separation have to be considered, including the developmental outcome
   of a sensorial environment which is quite different from the
   intra-uterine one. Research has been developing in this field. The
   cooperation between neonatalogists and psychologists has been
   profitable to parents. Problems linked to the separation, such as
   difficulty in representing the infant, are no more frequent owing to
   the attention paid to the mother-child bond and subsequent early
   contacts. What is forward now is the impact of an hyper technical world
   of intensive care on the parents, and of the strange aspect of the tiny
   baby surrounded by engines and tubes. Such an overpresence of reality
   often results in a reaction of traumatic daziness among parents. The
   cooperation of the whole staff is necessary for the resumption of an
   imaginary process of psychic functioning. Finally, the survival of
   very-low-birth weight infants confronts the neonatalogists with some
   delicate ethical questions. Psychiatrists and psychologists might have
   an important part to play in aiding the profession in its sorting out
   of these ethical issues.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the written genres of a group of six children in a
   first grade classroom. Using the dual lenses of sociocognitive
   constructivism and emergent literacy, it explores relationships among
   the children's genres and between these genres and the social context
   of the classroom in which the children's written discourse is situated.
   Analysis of naturalistic data (using an integrated functional-formal
   analysis which considered substance, intention, form and context as
   interrelated dimensions of genre) resulted in a classification scheme
   which encompassed all genres in the children's writing.
   Analyses of the classroom discourse revealed the children to be active
   participants in the social dialogue within their classroom. They
   constructed their written genres in response to the texts with which
   they engaged during collaborative reading and writing tasks and in
   response to the ways in which the teacher structured the writing tasks.
   They acted upon their world by writing about their personal
   experiences, creating imaginary worlds through drawing and writing and
   playing with words and ideas.
   The genres the children employed came from the morning news, from
   stories and poems, and from genres that were embedded in their literacy
   environment or constructed by them in collaboration with their teacher
   and each other Both construction and appropriation were seen as active
   processes on the part of the child rather than as passive imitation or
   copying from models.}},

   term `'psychosomatic,'' the authors explored the meanings assigned to
   the term psychosomatic among registered nurses (N = 189) employed in a
   variety of settings.
   METHODS:  The Psychosomatic Attitude Scale (PAS) was used to categorize
   the meaning of psychosomatic as either imaginary, functional,
   structural, or holistic.
   FINDINGS:  Although nurses theoretically espouse a holistic approach to
   client care, only 46\% of the nurses sampled gave a holistic
   interpretation of the term psychosomatic.  A holistic interpretation
   was more common among nurses who had an internal health locus of
   control and who were extroverted and intuitive in their personality
   profile.  Further, nurses with a higher level of education and who
   practiced in maternity or psychiatric settings were more holistic in
   their understanding of the term psychosomatic.
   CONCLUSIONS:  The authors advocate further study of how beliefs,
   values, and personality traits interact to influence the nurse's
   interpretation of the term `'psychosomatic.''}},

Abstract = {{Observers made time-to-contact judgments about an imagined moving
   object that passed through an area of the visual field previously
   adapted to a single direction of real motion. The direction of imagined
   motion varied relative to the direction of adapting motion. When
   imagined motion was in the same direction as that experienced during
   adaptation, imagined speed was slowed; when imagined motion was in the
   opposite direction, its speed was increased; when adaptation and
   imagined motions were orthogonal, imagined speed was unaffected. The
   particular influence that prior adaptation has on imagined speed
   suggests that imagined motion and real vision may engage common neural
   mechanisms without being functionally equivalent. Negative aftereffects
   observed in imagined motion imply that the imagination represents
   movement as an inference from position changes of static images. (C)

Abstract = {{The operation of local politics in Britain is changing.  With the help
   of three case studies, this paper explores some of the implications of
   these changes.  One key aspect of change is the increased salience of
   `network' and `partnership' arrangements associated with the rise of
   local economic policy-making.  The importance of this shift has been
   widely recognised in areas of economic decline or stagnation and in
   what are generally analysed as more or less free-standing localities. 
   Here the focus is on change within the south-east of England, which has
   largely been defined in terms of `growth', and in which regional and
   sub-regional linkages make it very difficult to identify `localities': 
   instead, the moves beyond suburbanisation, towards what some have
   labelled `edge cities', highlight the importance of `imaginary'
   geographies to the shaping and reshaping of local political processes. 
   The local politics of growth help to construct an apparently cosy world
   of consensus which in practice serves to reinforce the power of some
   groups at the expense of others.}},

Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyses the process of exclusion of Saddam Hussein, in a
   Spanish newspaper, El Pais, in the period just before the Gulf War.
   This exclusion procedure is articulated on two axes: DIVISION and
   REJECTION (Foucault, 1964). `Division' means establishing an inclusive
   us and an exclusive them, in this case, him. This move therefore
   entails a personification of the conflict, which produces immediate
   feelings of identification or rejection, and simplifies how the war is
   understood. Both effects are reinforced by the second move of the
   exclusion procedure: `rejection'. Once the two camps are established an
   imaginary dimension, related to the ideology of consensus and ethnic
   prejudices, is evoked in order to create an image of Saddam Hussein in
   which he plays the stranger, the irrational being, the madman, the
   beast and, ultimately, the personification of evil. These are the
   villain's attributes in the fairy tale of the just war (Lakoff, 1992),
   which is the script of the event activated by the newspaper for the
   conceptualization of the conflict and its protagonists. On the other
   hand, a positive image is created for a unique and ideological us, in
   which, as readers, we are included and absorbed.}},

Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{55-67}},
Abstract = {{Taking the example of the poetry of Grace Nichols and more briefly Toni
   Morrison's Beloved, this paper provides a materialist critique of some
   French feminists' individualistic and dehistoricized notions of
   `writing the body' and of the semiotic as the female body's only
   authentic language.  Arguing that the relation to one's body is
   necessarily mediated by the social/symbolic order and that subjectivity
   is historically specific, the paper explores the ways found by Nichols
   in which to write the black female body of slaves and their
   African-Caribbean descendents, in particular her use of metaphor as a
   means of encompassing both history and the body.  This poetic process
   simultaneously acknowledges the material conditions created by
   colonialism and slavery, yet seeks a transition to a new symbolic
   order.  The past is embodied; history, resistance and sexuality are
   linked.  I show how we need to appreciate the historical meanings in
   Nichols' images and see how she transforms this past into images of
   resistance and revolution-a possible re-entry into the imaginary.  I
   finally question the extent to which she is able to effect this
   transition in her use of Africa and the mother:  old and new, distance
   and return are at best held in necessary relation.}},

   Before, they had completed an imaginary questionnaire version, that is,

   Three main findings emerged.  (1) Over all subjects, repetitions of the
   same response alternative were significantly avoided only in the
   imaginary version, indicating that item content in the Myers-Briggs
   Type Indicator overrode response stereotypy.  (2) On the imaginary
   version, repetition avoidance was significant for those subjects who
   said they believed in extrasensory perception (ESP) but not for
   nonbelievers, corroborating previous reports of an association between
   belief in ESP and repetition avoidance.  (3) In comparison to
   nonbelievers, believers in ESP scored higher on the dimension
   `'feeling'' (as opposed to `'thinking'') of the Myers-Briggs Type
   Indicator.  This result is in line with the assumption that belief in
   ESP is associated with a style of thinking more typical for the right

   in appetite, nausea, insomnia and weight gain.  Seventy-three couples
   with the women in the last month of pregnancy were given a

   negation and an imaginary companion are probably related to protective
   mechanisms against anxiety generated by losses, specially loss of

   manifestations of deep changes in mental life. Four types of
   psychiatric disorders identified in subjects, suffering from a

   belongings; b) Delusional or hallucinatory presence of imaginary
   companions followed by attachment to a transitional object; c)
   Presbyophrenia with confabulation and misidentifications; d)
   Confabulation of denial that allows coping with catastrophic anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{A model of travel mode choice is tested by means of a survey among 199
   inhabitants of a village. Car choice behavior for a particular journey
   is predicted from the attitude toward choosing the car and the attitude

   from general car habit, on the other hand. Unlike traditional measures
   of habit, a script-based measure was used. General habit was measured
   by travel mode choices in response to very global descriptions of
   imaginary journeys. In the model, habit is predicted from the degree of
   involvement with the decision-making about travel mode choice for the
   particular journey (decisional involvement) and from the degree of
   competition in a household with respect to car use. The model proves
   satisfactory. Moreover, as suggested by Triandis (1977), there is a
   tradeoff between attitude and habit in the prediction of behavior: When
   habit is strong the attitude-behavior relation is weak, whereas when
   habit is weak, the attitude-behavior link is strong.}},

   remains salient if these relationships are insecure. These hypotheses

Abstract = {{This paper explores the meaning of experiences of invisibility in
   women. It was inspired in the course of psychotherapy with a woman who
   felt invisible in her feminine identity and who hid her feminine desire
   within an imaginary paper bag. Her visual imagery traces a pattern of
   pathological feminine development through a faulty sensory connection
   between her body, the external world, and her unconscious symbolic
   self-representation. Questions about her invisibility have evoked an
   exploration of two developmental models of visual thinking-a cognitive
   and a psychoanalytic model. A study of the myth of Persephone
   contributes a literary prototype for the understanding of the
   transmission of invisibility across the generations of mothers and
   daughters. Furthermore, the analysis of several literary passages from
   the work of Angela Carter serves the purpose of drawing the reader into
   the experiential world of femininity as it moves from the invisible to
   the visible. The paper blends together ideas from various, often
   contending, theorists in a way which highlights how theories can
   complement one another in explaining clinical phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{College student subjects (N = 77) were assessed for atypical emotional

   correlated with 15 standard scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic
   Personality Inventory (MMPI). Thirty-two of the 150 resulting
   correlations were statistically significant (p < .05), a number shown
   to be well above chance expectations. Stepdown analyses showed that the
   Si, F, Sc, and Ma scores were positively related to atypical feelings

   related to typical feelings. Atypical feelings in relation to one's

Abstract = {{Four experiments investigated the use of cognitive strategies for

   position of a dot in a square figure that had distance markers placed
   along two sides. Subjects' responses were biased toward imaginary
   points of intersection formed by the distance markers when subjects
   responded from memory (Experiment 1) or while viewing the figures
   (Experiment 2). Dots located at an intersection point were reproduced
   more accurately than those located off an intersection. These findings
   demonstrate that empty regions of a figure can serve as subjective
   landmarks for spatial localization. In Experiment 3, dot relocation was
   found to be similarly distorted toward physical cross marks placed at
   the intersections of distance markers, supporting the landmark
   hypothesis. The attraction of dots to intersection points depends on
   the viewer employing a strategy of mentally projecting from distance
   markers to form imaginary intersections, which makes intersection
   points salient landmarks for coding location of nearby stimulus dots.
   In Experiment 4, attraction toward intersection points was observed
   only when subjects employed the projection strategy and not when
   instructed to use a different encoding strategy.}},

   Monologue-oriented children construct the story by making up imaginary

   Dialogue-oriented children, who seem more dependent on the picture book

Abstract = {{Commonsense notions of psychological causality emerge early and
   spontaneously in the child. What implications does this have for our
   understanding of the mind/brain and its development? In the light of

   result of the growth and functioning of a specialized mechanism (ToMM)
   that produces domain-specific learning. The failure of early
   spontaneous development of `'theory of mind'' in childhood autism can
   be understood in terms of an impairment in the growth and functioning
   of this mechanism. ToMM constructs agent-centered descriptions of
   situations or `'metarepresentations''. Agent-centered descriptions
   place agents in relation to information. By relating behavior to the
   attitudes agents take to the truth of propositions, ToMM makes possible
   a commonsense causal interpretation of agents' behavior as the result
   of circumstances that are imaginary rather than physical. Two early
   attitude concepts, pretends and believes, are discussed in the light of

Abstract = {{Objective: Auditory hallucinations are a serious problem for a large
   subgroup of psychotic patients who do not respond optimally to
   neuroleptic medication. It has been hypothesized that hearing imaginary
   voices involves the same physiological processes as those involved in
   hearing real voices, but this hypothesis has not been conclusively
   confirmed. Method: In this study a consonant-vowel version of the
   Dichotic Listening Test was used to assess the functional integration
   of the left hemisphere in hallucinating and nonhallucinating psychotic
   patients. The test was administered under three conditions: a nonforced
   attention condition, a condition in which attention was forced to the
   left ear, and one in which attention was forced to the right ear.
   Results: The nonhallucinating patients showed the normal right ear
   advantage, which indicates a left hemisphere superiority in the
   processing of linguistic stimuli. In contrast, the hallucinating
   patients showed no ear advantage, Neither group was able to modify its
   performance when instructed to attend to either the left or the right
   ear. A subgroup of patients was tested in both hallucinating and
   nonhallucinating states, but the ear asymmetry was not noticeably
   different between these states. Conclusions: The results suggest that
   auditory hallucinations are associated with abnormalities in left
   hemisphere functioning and that these abnormalities might not be
   limited to the time of the auditory hallucinations. It is hypothesized
   that a relatively enduring left hemisphere abnormality may leave some
   patients at risk for auditory hallucinations.}},

Abstract = {{This article aims to set an agenda for further research into the
   following issues: which concepts of `homeland' ('Heimat') lead to
   anxieties about those defined as foreigners' ('Auslander') and which
   ones are able to include the `newcomers'? How do these concepts relate
   to people's ability to intervene into contradictory social structures
   In order to do this, it presents some results from a study which
   explores concepts of `Heimat' and `Auslander' held by the ethnic
   majority. Statements made by the sample of middle-class women and men
   in Switzerland and Germany suggest that the holding of harmonious
   images of Heimat tends to be associated with perceiving `Auslander' as
   the source of social conflicts. However, the inability to appropriate
   even an imaginary space seems to be related to an inability to open up
   to new experiences as neighbourhoods change.}},

Abstract = {{From its inception, child psychoanalysis has used fantasy play as a
   window to both the content and process of children's inner worlds.
   Because of the link to action and primary process, young children's
   imaginary play is rich in symbolic expressions that facilitate analytic
   interpretive interventions addressing the conflicts impeding
   development. There are inevitable tensions between allowing play to
   emerge as a therapeutic process in its own right and the usual
   psychoanalytic emphasis on clarification, verbalisation and, above all,
   interpretation within and about the transference. For many children,
   the very act of playing carries much of the therapeutic work aimed
   toward facilitating their return to developmentally appropriate and
   adaptive psychic functioning. The mobilisation of capacities for play
   in the analysis allows children to do what is needed for their
   development to continue and makes use of the developmentally
   restorative functions of play in the service of therapeutic action.}},

Abstract = {{Cycling performance is affected by the interaction of a number of
   variables, including environment, mechanical, and human factors.
   Engineers have focused on the development of more efficient bicycles.
   Kinesiologists have examined cycling performance from a human
   perspective. This paper summarizes only certain aspects of human
   ergonomics of cycling, especially those which are important for the
   recent current research in our departments. Power is a key to
   performance of physical work. During locomotion an imaginary flow of
   energy takes place from the metabolism to the environment, with some
   efficiency. The `useful' mechanical muscle power output might be used
   to perform movements and to do work against the environment. The
   external power is defined as the sum of joint powers, each calculated
   as the product of the joint (net) moment and angular velocity. This
   definition of external power is closely related to the mean external
   power as applied to exercise physiology: the sum of joint powers
   reflects all mechanical power which in principle can be used to fulfil
   a certain task. In this paper, the flow of energy for cycling is traced
   quantitatively as far as possible. Studies on the total lower limb can
   give insight into the contribution of individual muscles to external
   power. The muscle velocity (positive or negative) is obtained from the
   positions and orientations of body segments and a bar linkage model of
   the lower limb. The muscle activity can be measured by
   electromyography. In this way, positive and negative work regions in
   individual muscles are identified. Synergy between active
   agonistic/antagonistic muscle groups occurs in order to deliver
   external power. Maximum power is influenced by body position, geometry
   of the bicycle and pedalling rate. This has to be interpreted in terms
   of the length-tension and force-velocity-power relationships of the
   involved muscles. Flat road and uphill cycling at different saddle-tube
   angles is simulated on an ergometer. The measured pedal forces
   (magnitude and direction) are only dependent on the intersegmental
   orientation of saddle tube, crank position, upper and lower leg, and
   foot. The changed direction of the gravitational force with respect to
   the saddle-tube does not interfere with the co-ordinated force
   production pattern. During locomotory cycling at constant speed the
   external power is mainly used to overcome the aerodynamic friction
   force. This force and the rolling resistance are determined by coasting
   down experiments, yielding the external power. At the same external
   power, somewhat higher values of VO2 are measured during actual cycling
   compared to cycling on an ergometer (mean difference of 0.5 l/min,
   possibly due to keeping balance and to a difference in internal
   friction of the bicycles). The `energetic' ergonomics of cycling is
   compared with other sports: speed skating as a similar leg exercise and
   arm crawl swimming as a contrast. The large differences observed are
   thought to reflect the specificity of the various types of exercise.}},

   presuppose only the weakest possible claims to equality. Finally it
   concludes with criticism of his bizarre and perverse assumption that
   concern about the consequences of our actions has little or nothing

Abstract = {{This article addresses the question how fast and accurate the location
   of a single stimulus can be perceived. In Experiment 1, we measured
   localization performance in a task which required subjects to perceive
   and report the location of a single target stimulus ('{*}' sign)
   presented in one square of an imaginary 25 x 19 grid. Two factors were
   varied: stimulus duration and stimulus eccentricity. Stimulus duration
   was manipulated by employing a backward masking stimulus. Ten intervals
   (stimulus onset asynchronies) separated target and masking stimulus:
   25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 350 ms. Stimulus
   eccentricity was manipulated by presenting the target stimulus at five
   different distances from the fixation point. The observer localized the
   target stimulus by moving the cursor from the middle of the grid (the
   initial fixation point) to the perceived target location by pressing
   the `arrow' keys on the keyboard. Localization performance showed to be
   typically related to stimulus duration. That is, two components could
   be distinguished: The first component represented an initial steep rise
   in localization performance during the first 50 ms of stimulus
   duration; the second component represented a gradual rise in
   localization performance after 50 ms, reaching maximal performance at
   about 300 ms. We interpreted these two localization performance
   functions as reflecting the operation of two systems, namely the
   attentional system for the initial strong increase and the eye movement
   system for the subsequent gradual increase. In Experiment 2, we
   measured saccadic eye response latencies to clarify the role of eye
   movements in localization performance. It was found that in 98.4\% of
   all trials saccades were executed, and, moreover, that saccadic eye
   response latency decreased with increasing stimulus duration. In
   Experiment 3, we compared localization performance in the absence and
   presence of eye movements and demonstrated that localization
   performance for stimulus durations up to 50 ms was independent of eye
   movements. Overall, the present findings were interpreted as evidence
   in support of a two-process model of localization performance in which
   a shift of attention is followed by a rapid eye movement toward the
   target location. In line with a continuous flow conception of visual
   information processing, our model assumes that location information
   takes time to develop in the visual system; hence, an observer's
   localization response may be based on qualitatively different processes
   operating on qualitatively different kinds of information. In case of
   short duration stimuli, information conveyed by transient cells is used
   by the attentional system to shift attention toward the target
   location; this results in course location information being available.
   In case of longer duration stimuli, information conveyed by sustained
   cells is used by the eye movement system to prepare and generate a
   saccade toward the target location. Fine location information therefore
   depends on the accuracy of the generated saccade which in turn depends
   on the duration of the stimulus. A final gaze hypothesis is advanced to
   capture the importance of eye position information in manual aiming
   performance. Finally, it is emphasized that the present findings
   require confirmation and extensions; possible directions for future
   research are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Perspectives in sociology are currently being.reassessed in light of
   postmodernism, which has been associated with the abandonment of faith
   in the social self and scientific inquiry. As an emergent problematic,
   postmodernism stands in sharp contrast to a modernist pragmatic (and
   innocent) conception of symbolic interactionism-which is centered in
   the Meadian conception of prosocial selves. However, this article
   identifies some `'late-modem'' interactionists-Goffman, Stone, Becker,
   Lemert, and Mills-who, in providing a corrective for an innocent
   pragmatic inquiry into the self, created a foundation for contemporary
   inquiry into the social. This corrective entailed a reconceptualization
   of the self as the focal point of the situated act and, specifically,
   its changing definition from cooperative and reflective to strategic
   and imaginary. While we suggest that their work represented a loss of
   innocence in interactionism, it did not create a loss of faith in
   scientific inquiry into the self and social action. Rather, the work of
   the late modernists has inspired a reconstruction of scientific inquiry
   into the social that encompasses, but is not encompassed by,
   postmodernism.}},

Abstract = {{Scholars of different theoretical persuasions seem united in
   considering imaginary play an `'all good'' activity with unambiguously
   positive functions for the current well-being as well as for the
   longterm development of the child. This article questions the
   assumption that play can have only positive functions.
   The paper first tries to establish the existence of games which may
   reasonably be characterized as evil. Next it identifies certain
   conceptual problems which seem to facilitate the tendency to overlook
   possible negative functions of play. To help overcome these problems,
   the paper proposes a general model of the spheres of reality within
   which the playing child operates. On the basis of this model, play is
   analysed as an activity that may enchant the child to move beyond his
   or her normal limits in a way which may or may not be culturally
   accepted. It is concluded that play can have not only cathartic or
   neutral functions with regard to expressing and elaborating on evil.
   Under certain circumstances it can also generate evil tendencies.
   Finally it is pointed out that certain characteristics of contemporary
   Western society probably promote the willingness among adults,.
   including scholars, to conceive play as an all-good activity and to
   expect the child to be an exceptionally uncomplicated and good-natured
   member of society.}},

   patterns, and that interval is about 20 cm in imaginary size. 4) The
   smaller the knot ratio, the more `'agreeable'' the wall-panel becomes.
   (The knot-ratio is an area fraction between knots and a panel.) 5) The
   proper amount of randomness in the arrangement of knots gives
   relatively `'agreeable'' and `'beautiful'' images, and the degree of

   coefficient of the surface states for minority carriers. Photocurrent
   diagrams were constructed for these three mechanisms of nonlinearity at
   different levels of constant background illumination l, In the complex
   plane, the frequency spectrum of the photocurrent shifts along the real
   photocurrent axis with increasing l, while the frequency at the maximum
   of the imaginary part (the reciprocal of relaxation time) increases
   when nonlinearity is present. Experimental possibilities for separation

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{To investigate the symbolic quality of preschoolers' gestural
   representations in the absence of real objects, 48 children (16 3-, 4-,
   and 5-year-olds) performed 2 tasks. In the first task, they were asked
   to pretend to use 8 common objects (e.g., `'pretend to brush your teeth
   with a toothbrush''). There was an age-related progression in the
   symbolic quality of gestural representations. 3- and 4-year-olds used
   mostly body part gestures (e.g., using an extended finger as the
   toothbrush), whereas 5-year-olds used imaginary object gestures (e.g.,
   pretending to hold an imaginary toothbrush). To determine if children's
   symbolic skill is sufficiently flexible to allow them to use gestures
   other than those spontaneously produced in the first task, in the
   second task children were asked to imitate, for each object, a gesture
   modeled by an experimenter. The modeled gesture was different from the
   one the child performed on the first task (e.g., if the child used a
   body part gesture to represent a particular object, the experimenter
   modeled an imaginary object gesture for that object). Ability to
   imitate modeled gestures was positively related to age but was also
   influenced by the symbolic mode of gesture. 3-year-olds could not
   imitate imaginary object gestures as well as body part gestures,
   suggesting that young preschoolers have difficulty performing symbolic
   acts that exceed their symbolic level even when the acts are modeled.
   Results from both tasks provide strong evidence for a developmental
   progression from concrete body part to more abstract imaginary object
   gestural representations during the preschool years.}},

   operative when settings to be used in television commercials are
   created. In a simulated preproduction task, 25 professional property
   masters were asked to choose from among an assortment of three types of
   props to dress the set for four different commercial scenarios, each of
   which varied the gender and implied social class of the actor who would
   appear. Extremely high convergence among participants was obtained for
   prop choices, and these selections systematically varied as the actor's
   demographic background was alternated. This consensus highlights the
   need for further research on stylistic context in advertising - the
   physical and sensory cues that `'place'' a product in some real or

   idiosyncratically in the perspective-setting strategies they picked,

   remarkable precision, taking their partners' perspectives just as often

   whose perspective they were taking when they held the floor for only

Abstract = {{The symmetric radial arm maze, described by Olton in 1976, has
   developed into an important tool for the study of spatial memory. In a
   typical test an animal is placed in the centre of the maze, which
   contains some small piece of food at the end of each arm. The sampling
   behaviour of the animal is then recorded. In such studies the score
   (number of choices of arms which still contain food) of the animal is
   normally compared with the score of an imaginary animal which changes
   arms entirely at random. In a new method of analysis the non-random
   score of the animal is split into two parts, one depending on memory
   and one on stereotypic choice behaviour. Even mild departures from
   randomness are shown to alter considerably the expected `random' score
   in an eight-armed maze. The part of the score claimed to depend on
   memory was shown to increase when the animals learn to search the maze,
   the stereotypic part did not. The general effect from stereotypic
   choice behaviour is shown to result, in most animals, in an increase in
   the total score. In an eight-armed maze this increase may amount to
   more than 20\% of the total non-random score, even in a well-trained
   animal. The effect is less pronounced in mazes with 16 arms. It has
   been proposed that hippocampal lesions produce a stereotypic behaviour.
   We propose, based on our analysis, that the stereotypic behaviour is
   not produced but revealed by hippocampal lesions which destroy almost
   completely the memory-guided behaviour masking the stereotypic

   Children with and without ICs did not differ in their ability to

Abstract = {{The article presents the idea that individuals possess three main
   mental representations of distributions regarding group categories:
   trait differentiation, person differentiation, and the interaction
   between trait and person variabilities. These representations are
   called Implicit Distribution Theory. The study examined the stability
   of these distributional notions, their interrelationships, and their
   relation to subsequent judgments. The implicit distribution theories of
   89 students regarding university professors were captured twice by
   asking them to distribute 100 imaginary professors on 5-point scales
   for each of 13 attributes commonly used in professors' evaluations.
   Several weeks afterwards 50 of these subjects rated four known
   professors on the same attributes. Test-retest reliability was quite
   high for trait and person differentiation, and these constructs were
   independent. Person differentiation significantly predicted parallel
   features in raters' judgments of actual performance, while trait
   differentiation yielded significant correlations with most distribution
   measures of actual ratings. The findings are related to the concepts of
   mental representation, cognitive complexity, and cognitive biases in
   person perception as well as to their potential applications in
   organizational settings.}},

   4 stories to assess their understanding of representational relations.
   Children of both ages understood that, whereas perception is necessary
   for knowledge, it is irrelevant for imagination. Results for children's
   understanding of representational relations revealed intriguing
   developmental differences. Although children understood that knowledge
   represents reality more truthfully than imagination, 3-year-olds often
   claimed that imagination reflected reality. The second study provided
   additional evidence that younger 3-year-olds judge that imaginary
   representations truthfully reflect reality. We propose that children's

   mental states and the world, but also a confusion regarding the extent
   to which mental contents represent the physical world.}},

Abstract = {{The production of a `'Gulf Crisis'' out of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
   in August 1990, and the subsequent inscription and mediation of the
   conflict, created a spatiality that facilitated the pulverization of
   peoples and places in Iraq and Kuwait in early 1991. This paper
   attempts to open up this spatiality to empirical investigation and
   theoretical reflection. It addresses four issues: firstly show the
   crisis came to be narrated as the `'Gulf Crisis,'' secondly, the
   official geographing of the crisis with particular sets of meanings and
   imaginary geographies by the Bush administration, thirdly, the role
   speed played in the crisis, and finally, the electronic, televisual
   spatiality of the conflict. How one describes the spatiality of the
   Gulf conflict poses a difficult theoretical question. One possibility
   is to geographicalize Levinas and Bauman's arguments concerning `'the
   effacement of the face.'' However, narratives of `'the effacement of
   place'' ultimately rest on an innocenting of place.}},

Abstract = {{Children's understanding of adult pretense was assessed in seven
   experiments. By the age of 28 months, children are able to understand
   when an adult refers to a make-believe substance, such as `'tea'' or
   `'cereal'': they appropriately direct their pretend actions to a prop
   that `'contains'' the substance (Experiment 1). Similarly, when an
   adult introduces a make-believe substitution (e.g., treats wooden
   blocks as bananas), children appropriately extrapolate that
   substitution to new props (Experiment 2). In acknowledging such
   make-believe identities, children are flexible: they direct different
   pretend actions to the same prop depending on the make-believe identity
   that is conferred on it by the ongoing pretense episode (Experiments 3
   and 4). When they watch an adult transform an imaginary substance by
   `'pouring,'' `'spilling,'' `'squeezing,'' etc., children can also work
   out the causal consequences. They realize, for example, that imaginary
   tea has been spilled onto a table or that imaginary toothpaste has been
   squeezed onto a make-believe banana. They produce a suitable remedial
   action (Experiment 5) or describe what has happened with appropriate
   nonliteral language (Experiments 6 and 7). A theoretical model is
   proposed to explain how children can both construct a coherent mental
   representation of a pretense episode and use that representation to
   guide pretend actions and language. The model is compared to other
   proposed accounts of pretense.}},

Abstract = {{Transient dissociative episodes are a common and normative phenomenon
   during childhood that generally decrease during adolescence to
   relatively low levels in adults. Retrospective clinical research has
   firmly established a connection between childhood trauma and the
   development of dissociative disorders in adults. A growing number of
   clinicians are now identifying dissociative symptoms in abused
   children, and there is increasing evidence that dissociative disorders
   represent a significant and hitherto unrecognized form of
   psychopathology in traumatized children. Pathological dissociation is a
   complex psychobiological process that results in a failure to integrate
   information into the normal stream of consciousness. It produces a
   range of symptoms and behaviors including: (a) amnesias; (b)
   disturbances in sense of self, (c) trance-like states; (d) rapid shifts
   in mood and behavior, (e) perplexing shifts in access to knowledge,
   memory, and skills; (f) auditory and visual hallucinations; and (g)
   vivid imaginary companionship in children and adolescents. Many of
   these symptoms and behaviors are misdiagnosed as attention, learning or
   conduct problems, or even psychoses. Early identification and
   therapeutic intervention appear to be particularly efficacious in
   children in contrast to adults, although systematic studies of

   Events of a satanic cult ritual abuse scare in England are used to
   illustrate the collective behavior dynamics. The interpretation
   suggests that the activism of moral crusaders is a response to belief
   in frames for attributing meaning to an ambiguous problem, linked to
   shared concerns for fighting ``evil{''} in society. The conclusion is
   that controversies surrounding claims about ritual child abuse can be

   questionnaire assessing attitudes toward pain patients revealed that
   medical students have limited personal experience with pain and

   attitudes toward pain patients were dominated by perceived negative
   characteristics of pain patients and the belief that working with such
   patients is difficult. Attitudes measured 5 months after the course
   reflected increased complexity, greater emphasis that pain is real and
   not imaginary, and stronger belief that working with pain patients is
   rewarding. Five months after the seminar, students reported more

Abstract = {{The hypothesis in this investigation is, that the description of the
   event <<examination>> will be determined by <<anxiety>> in
   characteristic manner. This appears in the way, subjects describe their
   own examinations as well as in their descriptions of prototypical
   examination events.
   Methods: High(HA)- and low(LA) anxious subjects had to describe their
   own examination and those of - imaginary - high respectively low
   anxious persons (in spontaneous speech). Manner of speaking, amount of
   speechproduction, speechdisorders, ratings and rating time were taken
   as dependent variables. 44 subjects took part in the experiment.
   Results: HA value <<examination>> more negative, they show a
   characteristic way of speaking (longer texts, longer pauses) and
   characteristic speech disorders. Texts produced by HA are emotionally
   more negative than those produced by low anxious subjects. If the
   imaginary situation of examination described is compatible to the
   subjects-self-concept, rating time and speech pauses are shorter and
   the subjects' choice of words indicates an increased identification
   with the event described.}},

Abstract = {{Two discrimination experiments were run to investigate analog versus
   discrete properties of a shift of visual spatial attention. Central
   cuing was used in Experiment 1, whereas peripheral cuing was used in
   Experiment 2. Presentation of a probe stimulus between fixation and the
   target (Distance 1), opposite fixation from the target (Distance 3), or
   away from an imaginary line running from the target through fixation
   (Distance 2) permitted a fine-grained analysis of attention at those
   loci across target-probe delays. D-prime analyses in both experiments
   suggest that attention is shifted in a discrete manner between
   locations. Sensitivity to probes was generally greater when the probe
   was aligned with the target and fixation, with Distance 3 equal to
   Distance 1, than when it was away (at Distance 2). Analysis of
   sensitivity to targets across cue-probe delays suggests that attention
   was directed to the probe upon its appearance.}},

Abstract = {{In contemporary psychoanalytic training, theory is always mentioned
   last of all and its role always minimised in relation to the personal
   analysis and to supervision. It is treated with mistrust and seen as a
   source of resistance, especially in the case when one is dealing with
   authors belonging to other psychoanalytic sub-groups. Each analyst is
   invested with an imaginary power (by way of the transference) and with
   a real power (by way of his institutional capacities). A third -
   symbolic - power is granted to the theoretician analyst, whose
   influence is not to be underestimated. The corpus of Freud's work has
   been fragmented since his death  into a certain number of subsystems
   which compete with each other and in which it is difficult to
   distinguish true innovations from neo-formations whose role is to
   legitimate alternatives to the unbearable nature of analytic truth.
   Only time will do justice to the attempts to block challenging new
   ideas and to prove the fallacious character of certain conceptions
   which have won favour by their novelty.}},

Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Subjects viewed a foveally stabilized target presented against a
   background field of dots moving sinusoidally. Several different modes
   of viewing the target were used (subjects were instructed to gaze,
   look, or hold), and the frequency of sinusoidal field motion was varied
   from 1/32 to 2 Hz. In line with previous findings, the presence of a
   stabilized target resulted in substantial suppression of optokinesis.
   The characteristics of this suppression (gain and phase of slow
   residual eye movements) were dependent on both the mode of viewing the
   target and the frequency of field motion. When subjects used an
   imaginary target, little suppression occurred. These findings provide
   an overall profile of dynamic characteristics of mechanisms involved in
   the suppression of optokinesis. They support the view that this
   suppression is significantly determined by the presence of a target
   against a moving background (even without retinal slip), and by the
   mode of attending to the target.}},
